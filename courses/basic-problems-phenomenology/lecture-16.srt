1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,319
Now, I want to, before I go on to the temporalitate, which I'm going to keep calling temporalitate because I can't, which is the German, because I can't keep calling it temporality with a capital T.

2
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:14,080
That's too much of a mouthful.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,239
They're two totally different German words.

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:25,439
Teigliche gets translated temporality in here, and temporalitate gets translated temporality with a capital T.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,959
We'll just have to fix that.

6
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:44,999
But I did find one thing I want to do is to go back before we go on to something I found in an essay that Heidegger wrote in 1925 in which he talks about time and realism in science.

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,440
I don't know if I ever showed this to you.

8
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:47,159
Have I?

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,840
So I copied it because it's so relevant to what we've been talking about.

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,959
Oh, that's interesting.

11
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:54,679
Give me back one.

12
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,879
I didn't bring it with me, the book, but I don't need the book.

13
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:04,360
So I'll wait till you get it, and I'll just fill you in in the background of where we are.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,160
So starting at the top of 171, there's a sentence that's cut off, but it isn't important.

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,319
It starts where we want to start.

16
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,480
Philosophy is observation of the world, disclosing it in terms of its being.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,879
Here, the real being of the world is nature.

18
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,599
This is going to turn out to be not what Heidegger's doing, because we have to read it.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,439
The real being of the world is nature as that which always is.

20
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,319
The science of the world is in the first place, therefore an unlocking of nature.

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,600
And that's still, the Greeks could do that.

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:50,839
Nature has to be made present and accessible in its perceptual being and regularity in such a way that all those moments are excluded, which now comes the important part.

23
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,280
This is how we deal with nature.

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,640
Nature, let me think a minute.

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,840
No, I think just a second.

26
00:01:56,839 --> 00:02:03,480
No, that's still, the Greeks already are getting a view of nature which leaves us out of it.

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,440
So let me go on.

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:20,039
Nature has to be made present and accessible in its perpetual continuous being and regularity in such a way that all of those moments are excluded, which, through conditioning our access to the observation of nature, interfere with it.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:32,159
So, already in Plato, for instance, you get the idea that you don't, you want to contemplate the nature of theory and not involving perception in your body.

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,839
This tendency first developed in such a way that rather than erecting the particular laws, it secured fundamental concepts.

31
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,920
This happened in Greek philosophy.

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,480
So, they've got their own view of nature, but that's not what we're interested in.

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:54,480
But to the next sentence, which is important, modern physics led, and this is, remember what I'm trying to argue, so you can listen in the right way.

34
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:07,520
I want to say this is going to cast light on Heidegger's claim that there are time-free movements of nature and that we can have access to them, and our access can be totally contingent.

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,239
That is, in no way affect these laws.

36
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,920
That's what I claim.

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:28,959
He should say, if you're going to be a realist about science, and he does say it here, he says, modern physics led to the discovery of laws of motion, defining it in a way that was free of any reference to the contingencies of our access, measurement, and defining of them.

38
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,040
That's exactly the point.

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:50,960
And then he thinks the theory of relativity, far from making the laws of nature, or the laws describing the time-free movements of nature relative to us, relativity makes the, determines what counts as absolute motion.

40
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,559
So, the theory of relativity took seriously this idea of an absolute knowledge of nature.

41
00:03:56,559 --> 00:04:00,480
It's not a theory about the relative validity of physical laws.

42
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:09,119
Rather, it inquires to those conditions of definition and measurement that make it possible for nature to be grasped purely in terms of itself.

43
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,720
That is, that's what I keep going to talk about.

44
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:25,559
He wants to talk about the electrons, or in this case, space and time as they are in themselves, purely in terms of itself, and for its laws of motion to be understood.

45
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,999
That's all I want to read.

46
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:40,920
So the laws of motion are going to be these time-free descriptions of change, but it's going to be change without respect to us, without respect to now.

47
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,319
There's no now in the laws describing the movements of nature.

48
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,600
And it won't have in it earlier and later.

49
00:04:48,600 --> 00:05:01,480
Now, there's a place in here which I marked in my copy, which I left behind, on one of these pages where, but I want to talk about this not in class, but you might notice it if you read it.

50
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,679
He talks about science.

51
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:03,880
I wonder if we can skim it.

52
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Talks about science discovered describing things in terms of the earlier and the later.

53
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:17,159
And I would have hoped that he would have talked about it in terms of the before and after.

54
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,880
Let's skim it down for earlier and later.

55
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,200
I tried to find the German.

56
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,319
What?

57
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,360
Really?

58
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,280
And that's nice.

59
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,720
Where is that?

60
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,319
I see.

61
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,800
But you got there without any earlier and later?

62
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,439
It may be that it's not on one of these two pages.

63
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,840
I'll talk to you about it later.

64
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,400
Anyway, I'm trying to track down the German.

65
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,119
It would be what?

66
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:42,360
For hair and not hair would be one possibility.

67
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,759
And that's, and what he would, and that could be translated earlier and later, but it could also be translated before and after.

68
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,360
Where's the fore and after now?

69
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,720
The last paragraph?

70
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,879
Okay.

71
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,400
Because Aristotle is what is counted in motion with respect to before and after.

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,280
Ah, yes.

73
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:05,199
That's the whole discussion of Aristotle that we've gotten, the basic problems too.

74
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,879
That's that's on the right track, Heidegger thinks.

75
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,480
But somewhere, oh, here it is.

76
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,040
Got it.

77
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,160
Middle paragraph.

78
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,920
Thus, time, even thought of as the time, time at the beginning of the middle paragraph.

79
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:25,280
Thus time, even thought of as the time of nature, does not have to be conceived of in an absolute metaphysical fashion.

80
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,639
This is one of the basic discoveries of the theory of relativity.

81
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:37,040
Physical time is one-dimensional, irreversible, is a one-dimensional, irreversible multiplicity of earlier and later moments.

82
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,239
That worries me.

83
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:46,400
I really looked all over German Amazon trying to find the original paper that the footnote tells this is from.

84
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,159
But it's now is unrepeatable and so forth.

85
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,319
We just have to look into that.

86
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,639
But in general, even if that says earlier and later, then that's important to worry about.

87
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,320
Because if he really says earlier and later, then I'm stumped.

88
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,559
Or he's confused.

89
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:09,040
And this is two years before being in time.

90
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,400
But I just don't believe he's going to say that.

91
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:23,200
He knows already, presumably, that earlier and later are relative to a now, and now is something that we bring to the time-free movements.

92
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,920
I can't believe that he said that.

93
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,600
But I if I th if this weren't the last lecture I'd give in fact, I'll tell you, I've all got your email addresses.

94
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,480
If he really did say that, I'll send you an email telling you we're we're back to square one.

95
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
And uh that's the best I could do.

96
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,840
Let's hope I don't have to.

97
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,520
Um okay.

98
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,439
Anybody want to say anything about that?

99
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:50,040
I mean, uh, of all people, I think Jamie might want to because he just wrote his honor's thesis on this issue.

100
00:07:50,040 --> 00:08:06,280
Do you think this is a problem for for the he he has the interesting thesis that Heidegger is not interested in the in itself, sort of a metaphysi he's not a metaphysical realist about anything, not even about the things science studies.

101
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,559
And his thesis convinced me that Heidegger doesn't care much.

102
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,360
You'll notice he goes by in two thins.

103
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:36,360
He doesn't care much about whether we've got access to the necessary m laws of m the to the laws of motion that make our m practices for gaining access to them, namely doing science and so what contingent that is irrelevant to these time-free motions by way of these practices.

104
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,319
Heidegger does, I think, I think believe it.

105
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:48,679
James convinced me that Heidegger doesn't care much that it only gets mentioned for one page in being in time and in this article only for a few sentences.

106
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:55,640
But I do think it looks like he's talking like a realist about science, at least for a sentence.

107
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,640
We could talk about it later.

108
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,199
Okay, because that's a big by now it's a big issue after I mean we can't answer.

109
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,160
One sentence is not going to overthrow your view, I'm sure.

110
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,319
Okay, so now then we're going to go to the temporality tape.

111
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:20,520
I brought along the German for that, though I have nothing in mind in case something like that earlier or later comes up where this time I will be able to at least settle it.

112
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:26,319
Okay, let me just explain before I even start trying to lecture on this.

113
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:46,559
It's really providing me and sort of forcing me to realize how I approach something that is so difficult and so abstract as these pages about temporalitate and about praisance and so forth, that they are really dense and hard to understand.

114
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,079
I don't know how you feel about it.

115
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:52,240
How many had a chance to read the book you were supposed to be reading?

116
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
Not so many.

117
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:58,960
Well, then I'll read passages that will help you understand.

118
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,999
And part of what I want to talk about, I didn't assign.

119
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,359
And I realize now that I should have.

120
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:09,920
Only then I look out at your hands and I realize now it doesn't matter whether I did or not.

121
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,640
You've got other jobs to worry about.

122
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:32,000
But I'll read passages both from what we're going to what you should have been reading after page 30305 or something is where I'm going to g go to that there's there's stuff between where we stopped and 302 which is important to read.

123
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,080
But here's my method and this is what you and you have to help me with this or learn that this is the right way to do it or not the best the best way to do it I don't think there's any right way.

124
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:51,439
The best way to interpret Heidegger, but you know I'm always saying and at least I have Heidegger on my side sometimes that it's the phenomena that you've got to get in mind.

125
00:10:51,439 --> 00:11:14,360
You can't understand these strange abstract terms and without the phenomena, you're just throwing them around as there is a whole school of Heideggerians who specialize all their lives in throwing around these fancy terms, who think that the his book, Contributions to Philosophy, which has more fancy terms thrown around in more ways, is his greatest work, even greater than being in time.

126
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:24,360
But I'm trying hard to understand this by thinking of what it is he might be talking about when he's doing it.

127
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:31,480
And hopefully, if I get it right, that's going to be helpful to understand why he says what he said.

128
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:41,640
And on the other hand, if it does help us understand what he says while he says, that's good evidence that this interpretation is getting it right, or at least is a good interpretation.

129
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,840
So, and I can't just jump in and list all the phenomena at once.

130
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,520
They will come by one by one in what I want to say in, say, the next half hour.

131
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,160
So, let's start on 274.

132
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,480
Those of you who have, lots of you have basic problems now, or more of you, anyway.

133
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:06,200
And you, this isn't in the part that Tyler Xerox, I don't think, because it wasn't on the syllabus.

134
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,439
So, those who have it have it.

135
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:22,040
And so, on 274, there's this really dense paragraph, which I think resonates with a paragraph in being in time.

136
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,080
And says, I think that what he's talking about, no, let me read it first, and then I'll tell.

137
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,040
No, then you have to listen differently.

138
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:45,559
I think that what he's talking about, the phenomena there, is familiarity as the background upon which all of our understanding of ourselves and entities take place.

139
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:56,800
And after I read it, I'll put you the place in Being in Time where he says very similar things, um and he says if he's talking about familiarity.

140
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,839
That would be nice.

141
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,359
That would be a phenomenon.

142
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,920
We know what pheno what familiarity is.

143
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,599
He's given us a good example in being in time of a room.

144
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:07,040
So anyway, here we are.

145
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm going to read on two hundred and seventy-four, the end of the last paragraph of section nineteen, starting in the italics.

146
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,040
Temporality, remember that's cyclichai.

147
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,320
That means the the the temporal structure of Dasein, cyclichaid.

148
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:30,640
It's this ecstatical way of being that we are.

149
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,560
Temporality is the condition of the possibility of the constitution of Dasein's being.

150
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:42,800
Remember, in the language of being in time, temporality is the meaning of care.

151
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:46,240
Care is the meaning of Dasein's being.

152
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,800
However, to this constitution, there belongs understanding of being.

153
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:59,120
For the Dasein, as existent, comports itself towards beings which are not Dasein's and beings which are.

154
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:12,720
Accordingly, temporality must also be, and this is going to be very important to get s clear about, must also be the condition of the possibility of the understanding of being that belongs to Dasein.

155
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:23,360
Getting the phenomena right or is tied up with hearing that phrase, the conditions of possibility, right.

156
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:45,640
I'm going when you talk about the condition of the possibility of the understanding of being, you the the distinction between Lattner's approach, which is going to lead Heidegger into idealism, and my approach, which makes it at least com incompatible with realism, turns on, or will make a big difference how you understand that.

157
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,999
But right now, I'm just going to read it.

158
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:54,280
Accordingly, temporality must also be the condition of the possibility of the understanding of being that belongs to Dasein.

159
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:58,200
How does temporality make such understanding of being possible?

160
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:04,040
How is time, as temporality, the horizon for the explicit understanding of being as such?

161
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:15,080
If being is supposed to be the theme of the science of ontology or scientific philosophy, you need to be able to theorize about it.

162
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:26,679
In its role, as conditions of the possibility of the understanding of being, both preontological and ontological, we'll call temporality, sorry, let's try that again.

163
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:39,000
In its role as a condition of the possibility of the understanding of being, both preontological and ontological, we shall call temporality temporality te.

164
00:15:39,319 --> 00:16:07,159
So, temporality, which is structure Dasein, when it's the structure that makes possible, in some sense, the understanding of being, we're going to call it, and therefore is the basis of doing, is pre-ontological, because it's got in it an understanding of being, and it's the basis of doing ontology, we're going to call that temporality tag.

165
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:12,520
Now, that is pretty obscure, and I'm reading into it.

166
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:22,760
The only something, at least, which I can make sense of, a and happily, this is a better example than anything else I'm going to say in the lecture.

167
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:35,760
It looks like there is a phenomenon that he's talking about on 119 of being in time, which is just what this paragraph is talking about in a much more abstract way.

168
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,239
And so I'm going to read it.

169
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,079
That last paragraph.

170
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:47,280
That wherein Dasein already understands itself is always something with which it is primordially familiar.

171
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:57,199
I'm going to claim that familiarity is the phenomenon, and that's the on the basis of which we relate to entities.

172
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:07,439
This familiarity with the world does not necessarily require that the relations which are constituted for the world as world would be theoretically, should be theoretically transparent.

173
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:17,679
However, the possibility of giving these relations an explicit ontologico-existential interpretation is grounded in this familiarity.

174
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:25,359
So it looks to me like the giving an ontological interpretation is what this paragraph is about.

175
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:34,959
And this grounding in familiarity is the conditions of the, what he calls here, the conditions of the possibility of the understanding of being.

176
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,559
Let me go on.

177
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:45,359
And this familiarity in turn is constituted for Dasein and goes to make up Dasein's understanding of being.

178
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:56,079
So there you see, it's temporality, it turns out to be the conditions of the possibility of the understanding of being in basic problems.

179
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,919
Here, I think, familiarity is the same thing.

180
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,760
It's doing the same job.

181
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,639
It makes up Dasein's understanding of being.

182
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:18,680
This possibility is one which can be seized upon explicitly insofar as Dasein sets itself the task of giving being a primordial interpretation of its own being and the possibilities of that being, or indeed for the meaning of being in general.

183
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,199
That's ontology.

184
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:35,000
So somehow the familiarity makes up Dasein's understanding of being, and therefore, if you do a study of it, you can do ontology.

185
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:48,599
You could, when you push it all through, as he does trying to do the all, he doesn't do it, but he could do the past, present, and future the way he's done the, he'll do the present.

186
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:59,959
And he will, in principle, if you get the understanding of being, then you get the understanding of all the modes of being.

187
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:14,599
I said this before, I say it every once in a while to keep my own sanity, then you would get the understanding of being ready to hand, being present at hand, being Dasein, and you would have a general ontology.

188
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,240
Except there are even more basic issues, which is what we're going to come to.

189
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,760
You'd have the first stage of doing ontology.

190
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,520
Then you'd need to explain something about what makes that ontology possible.

191
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,280
We're not ready for that yet.

192
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,719
But what he calls here conditions of the possibility of the understanding of being, I think, is familiarity.

193
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,280
And why is that important?

194
00:19:44,599 --> 00:20:10,880
Well, because if you hear conditions of possibility in a Kantian way, which you would and should, I mean, that's it's Kant's phrase, then it looks like it's a Blattner claim that there is some kind of structure which Heidegger is getting up, which is what ontology wants to describe, and which makes possible our experience of objects and of equipment and others.

195
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:18,719
It's going to turn out, of course, it has to do the same job, make our encountering all sorts of beings possible.

196
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,040
But there are two ways you could make our encountering all sorts of beings possible.

197
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:34,079
One would be to have a kind of categorical structure which makes determinate, as Bill says, all the various modes of being.

198
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,399
And that's the easy thing to say.

199
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:48,399
That's what you would say if you were reading Kant, as Blattner has for years, ever since he was an undergraduate here, and reading it into Heidegger.

200
00:20:48,399 --> 00:21:08,079
But it would be a radical different thing to say that the condition of possibility really means that phenomenon on the basis of which you are able to have all the modes of being or all the forms of intentionality, as he'll put it later.

201
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:13,679
And it's a big difference because that's not a structure.

202
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,360
Familiarity is not a structure.

203
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,040
Familiarity is a very, very basic phenomenon.

204
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,119
And it's only on the basis of familiarity, with rooms, for instance, that we can encounter cares.

205
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:37,839
But that's not like saying that familiarity is a kind of structure which structures objects or equipment, they, like chairs and uh floors and walls and windows.

206
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,200
Do you see what I mean?

207
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:53,319
Uh and I think it's it's going to turn out and so if you you it's hard to know what the phenomenon is he's talking about in one two on two hundred and seventy four, but it must be the same as one hundred and nineteen.

208
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,239
I hope I've at least convinced you of that.

209
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,000
I mean, it does the same job.

210
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,159
He uses uh the same words.

211
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,599
It's all about finding out about the understanding of being.

212
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:10,040
So that mu and but it's it comes right after the discussion of the phenomenon of world.

213
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:28,280
And I think that it's part of the part of what's going on is he's describing the a certain aspect of the phenomenon of world, namely that it's familiar and it's the condition of the possibility of encountering anything.

214
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,679
So my first idea.

215
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,079
Tyler, good.

216
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:36,679
Okay, well I think of the structure as as conceptual.

217
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,079
I mean in Kant the the at least the structure is conceptual.

218
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:42,360
But go ahead.

219
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,119
And I think of the structure as somehow abstractible from what it's structured.

220
00:22:48,119 --> 00:23:03,240
For familiarity is is he says in in it's that it's pre ob when in basic problems, I'm going to come to it later, but he says it's pre-objective, pre-conceptual, and there's the third pre.

221
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,280
What would oh, and pre-ontological, whatever it is that this can you say that about?

222
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,800
Uh structure?

223
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,720
Yes, it's something Dasein does.

224
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,920
I I would have thought that was, I was I thought that was on my side.

225
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,760
I don't think one does a structure.

226
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,839
Well, even the gel in the term but the goal is the things.

227
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:42,480
An existential is a structure because it's the abstraction from the existential L-E-L.

228
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:45,599
Don't see that familiarity is like that.

229
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:50,079
I mean, it's it is familiarity doesn't seem to be an existential.

230
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,079
It seems to be a phenomenon.

231
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,879
It does.

232
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:02,639
It involves certainly an activity, a temporalizing activity.

233
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:08,239
Some pressing into the pressing into possibilities and throwing into moods.

234
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,040
But those aren't structures either, it seems to me.

235
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,559
Those are more phenomena.

236
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,079
Maybe we're not arguing about anything.

237
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:14,640
I don't know.

238
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:23,280
But don't it seems that when Latiner hears, remember the definition of being in being in time.

239
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,440
It's got this half a sentence of Dreyfus and half a sentence of Glatiner.

240
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,959
Being is that on the basis of which beings are already understood.

241
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,720
That's my verb in that familiarity, for instance.

242
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:46,640
And then Tama, that which determines beings, being, determines beings as determined, being so strange.

243
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:51,760
I mean, I don't see that on the basis of which beings are already understood.

244
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,880
Familiarity determines beings of being.

245
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,559
Determines the Kantian notion.

246
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:05,120
It's that there are these conceptual structures which literally structure the phenomenon.

247
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,199
You're looking worried, both of you, so there's probably something well enough very serious to worry about.

248
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,440
Maybe there's a non-issue here.

249
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,640
What do you think?

250
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,839
You're looking up, you want to say something.

251
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,520
Eugene, do you?

252
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,719
You're not seeing a difference either.

253
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,839
Huh?

254
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:23,959
Hmm.

255
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,000
That's a problem.

256
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,839
What's that?

257
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:31,400
There's not no familiarity is certainly not a chaos.

258
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:40,280
It's got a lot of, you could say structure, but it's not, but it's not.

259
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:46,680
Does it matter whether the structure is conceptual, abstractable, and so forth?

260
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:57,319
I mean, familiarity's kind of structure is a kind of structure which you can't abstract from the room if it's a familiarity with a room.

261
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,040
It's certainly not conceptual.

262
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,319
Maybe Blattner's a strong man.

263
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,880
Maybe Kant certainly has a structure.

264
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,720
We aren't disagreeing about that, are we?

265
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,839
That it's separable from what is structured and conceptual and so forth.

266
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:22,440
So it's just a question of whether Blatner, when he says that it's a structure which determines the I guess there's another way to put it, and then I sort of give up.

267
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:38,119
The Voralchin, which is this crucial word that we're worrying about, which I take to be on the basis of which, which maybe it helps to say, which I hear as the background, the holistic background of coping practice.

268
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:46,200
Blattner always says in his book, in terms of which, as soon as you go to in terms of which, it sounds much more conceptual.

269
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,879
You say, it's that in terms of which we determine entities as entities.

270
00:26:51,879 --> 00:27:07,119
Boy, that's a funny way of describing the, it seems to me, the practices which form the background of our the holistic practices which form the background of our specific intentional practices.

271
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,559
You don't hear a difference, or you think I'm making it up, I take it.

272
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,599
I think going to Don is something like that gives me on the science on it, which is the ultimate basis.

273
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,720
And the structure will be this three-fold temporal structure.

274
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:22,479
Well, what if I just took out the word and said it's activities on the basis of which?

275
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,280
What does it add to?

276
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,559
I keep that's what I either it seems to me it adds nothing to say structure or it adds something I don't want.

277
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,280
Okay, oh good.

278
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,040
Okay, it's based in maybe that's a good way to get the two views together.

279
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:40,960
It's based on a on practices in the background, Dasein practices in the background.

280
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,319
It's based upon them.

281
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,280
That we can articulate and talk about.

282
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,879
That's true, because he says you can make it the basis of an ontology.

283
00:27:48,879 --> 00:28:10,000
So I guess all that's left of my view is I want to make sure that that we don't just start at the second level where we've got something that we've already articulated and are now making an ontology, that at the very basic, very most basic level, it's a holistic bunch of activities that can be articulated.

284
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,800
That's all right.

285
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,399
Maybe both of you want to say that.

286
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,720
Maybe I maybe Bill wants to say that, because he does take a talk a lot about practices.

287
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,040
Yeah.

288
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:34,800
But in this reading we do today seem like the answer is that question because temporality is self-projecting.

289
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,160
That's right, that's right.

290
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:46,679
You think of the projection, sort of thinking like projecting a picture on the wall.

291
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:54,359
And wh that's that's don't right, don't think of the projecting your particular activities into future events.

292
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,839
And it's true now that temporality is what now?

293
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:07,319
Projection of Dasein's activity on okay let me look at wait let me I'll get to three oh seven.

294
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:15,800
Yeah, I'll put this wave I want to put this away and I want to look to see if what's happening here just to how how discouraged to be it's still working.

295
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,719
Okay, three oh seven.

296
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,599
There we are.

297
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,559
In the middle of the second paragraph.

298
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,359
Uh let's say looking backwards we say that temporality is in front of you.

299
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,040
Okay, let's good.

300
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,760
Let's go on.

301
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:36,600
So so whatever and whenever understanding exists, we ha we are here disregarding the other moments of the Dasein.

302
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:39,879
This understanding is possible only in temporality self-projection.

303
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:47,159
Dasein exists as unveiled because it makes possible the DAW and its unveiledness in general.

304
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,959
Well what do you and what do you get out of that?

305
00:29:50,599 --> 00:30:10,760
Well I guess now a lot of the instance but then we said uh the first thing on the next paragraph, temporality is self-projection simply as if we envision the possibility of all projections out of temporality some that's already concommittedly unveiled in all factors.

306
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:23,399
So um and then it'm gonna fast forward a little bit as it were very long before you got a understanding of the direction of being a harms and understanding of the Whoa whoa, that's a hard place.

307
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,119
Wh where are you?

308
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,239
We all ought to be looking at that.

309
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,879
Where?

310
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,239
Okay, uh I mean that's way ahead of where we are, but let's see if we can deal with it.

311
00:30:32,559 --> 00:31:07,359
I if we define temporality as the original constitution of Dasein, and thus as the origin of the possibility of the understanding of being, uh let's talk about that for a minute, the origin of the possibility of being so Dasein's constitution, namely taking a stand on its own being, is the origin of the possibility of the understanding of being, where the understanding of being is, I think, the background coping practice.

312
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,520
That's all right then.

313
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:34,720
Okay, so Dasein takes a stand on its being through doing all these specific things on the basis of some background familiarity, okay, then temporality, that's his temporalitate, then temporalitate as origin is necessarily richer and more pregnant than anything that may arise from it.

314
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:43,599
We have to get here step by step, because it it's not obvious at all what temporalitate is, ever, but not certainly not here.

315
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,359
I'll try a little further to myself.

316
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,079
No, let's wait.

317
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,679
We have to wait to get there.

318
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,319
Because that though that's it's so hard.

319
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,439
And then he gets the summing up paragraphs to condense it all into making it even harder.

320
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:00,000
Uh you you look like you want to say one more thing.

321
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,680
Temporalitate.

322
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,559
Because what?

323
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,439
That's right.

324
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:06,960
Temporalitate is where the buck stops in these levels.

325
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:15,719
So the temporalitate is uh the uh it's a rich uh it's a rich something, it says I don't think of the word structure.

326
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,119
What is it?

327
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:22,679
It's a it was right where back where where you were reading a minute ago.

328
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,559
Where were we on three nine, three eight?

329
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:26,680
You're rich.

330
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,800
Temporalitate is richer and more pregnant that anything may arise from it.

331
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:45,639
So I'm going to argue or try to show or claim or something that the where you've got to take apart this rich temporalitate into several different phenomena, which we get could be distinguishing as he goes through here.

332
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,319
But I can't say yet why.

333
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,679
And maybe we'll agree then.

334
00:32:50,680 --> 00:33:10,280
I mean, and when you put all these phenomena together, you get temporalitate, and temporalitate is that somehow activity of Dasein that makes the understanding of being possible, which in turn makes the encountering of particular beings possible.

335
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:18,680
And why we get these two levels of possibility and no m no less and no more is very hard to understand, but he he tries to explain it.

336
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,159
Okay.

337
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,599
Any anybody else?

338
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,359
I mean, Tyler, more, yeah.

339
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,079
Well, that's surely one of the things we better do in here, yeah?

340
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:28,280
Yeah?

341
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:40,520
When I hear you talk about phenomena, I think you're trying to stop the I think I have in mind, but I have to check this on what I have in mind.

342
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:48,600
In fact, I don't think the richness of temporalitate is an activity.

343
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,800
It's little aspects of an activity or so let's put together.

344
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:57,839
Uh well let's let me try it the other way.

345
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,800
What activity is it that uh you th you think it's an activity.

346
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,159
But that looks like that's the t the the the Zeitlichkeit with its ecstasies and horizons.

347
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,680
What's that doing, Dasein?

348
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:38,960
Then it looked like, let's just review, it looked like the bottom line in uh in ontology was that Dasein, as a being that takes a stand on its being, has the threefold ecstasies of the past, present, and future in their non-sequential form, and that each of those has a horizon, that is, something in the world corresponds to each of those things in Dasein in a way that they can't be separated.

349
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:40,079
That was the bottom line.

350
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,679
That's what we we agree.

351
00:34:42,160 --> 00:35:03,359
The non-cognitive continent funny that it happens, and I noticed this time reading through, sometimes it looks like that it is a sort of perelative structure between the ecstatic structure, which is due to Dasein, and the horizonal structure, which is due to the world.

352
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:18,399
And it looks like every ecstasy has a horizon, and sometimes it looks like the ecstasy sort of reaches out to a horizon, and sometimes it looks like it makes the horizon, because sometimes he'll he's always taking the horizon back to the ecstasy.

353
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:20,159
You you've noticed that too.

354
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,839
Right, I agree.

355
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,199
Good, absolutely.

356
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,559
And then it wouldn't be kinda no, no, but you you're on the right track, and it's not.

357
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:40,800
I mean, I the difference between an activity of Dasein and the phenomena, I mean the the the activity is also a phenomenon, I think.

358
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:50,519
So that, but there are phenomena that are not activities of Dasein, but are correlative with activities of Dasein.

359
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:53,000
That would be the non-Kantian side.

360
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:58,520
That would be the side that makes the horizon equally important to the ecstasy.

361
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,359
And sometimes he does talk that way.

362
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:08,600
And sometimes, just when I'm thinking, oh boy, he's got it, he goes back to saying it all goes back to Dasein's ecstasies, which just happened to have horizons.

363
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:13,080
But the ecstasies and Dasein are more basic than the horizons.

364
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,159
That sounds Kantian.

365
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:29,160
You have a Kantian thing which doesn't have anymore a conceptual structure, but has a kind of activity that goes back to the basic being that we are.

366
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:45,319
So why he doesn't see or want to say that one of our activities is certainly taking a stand on ourselves, and that gives us the three ecstasies, but it couldn't do it if it weren't linking up with the world.

367
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:46,439
That was the horizons.

368
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:47,479
I know you don't mind that.

369
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:52,359
That's sure you want to be a realist of some sort about it and not have it turn into Kant.

370
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:54,200
Well, we're going to go back over it.

371
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:04,999
I've got candidates for what the, on the world side, can't be absorbed into activities of Dasein, which really belong on the side of the horizons.

372
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:12,760
I'll tell you, I don't want to keep them up my sleeve, who I think he's getting at very, very deep and fundamental phenomena.

373
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:25,080
And I think one of them is affordances, that there has to be solicitations in the world to which Dasein is responding in its activity.

374
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:43,680
That would be way down in a kind of ontic level, but there on some abstract level, there has to be, or abstract is probably not the right word, on an ontological level, where we're talking about the background instead of talking about dealing with particular objects.

375
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,120
There still are, I think, something like affordances.

376
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:54,639
The other thing I think that he's got is that.

377
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,000
Well, that's the main one.

378
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:58,160
The other one may be on the side of Dasein.

379
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:14,560
It seems when he's talking about the unready to hand and how you recognize something that's missing, he's got a view about the readiness of Dasein to cope with things or to find its way around in the world.

380
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,319
And the readiness is another something.

381
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,879
But the readiness is on the side of Dasein.

382
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,440
But I guess, on the side, like the ecstasies.

383
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:36,479
And I'm trying to find out what in the world he thinks, if anything, and I think he does seem to think, is over on the horizon side, namely world.

384
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:39,120
Of course, self and world can't be separated.

385
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,079
Of course, it's all being in the world.

386
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:49,280
But it looks like for him, being in the world is finally really Dasein.

387
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,600
Dasein is being in the world.

388
00:38:51,600 --> 00:39:02,879
And somehow the world gets played down, and the being that takes a stand on its being, Dasein, gets made absolutely basic, more basic.

389
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,280
That's what I wish he wouldn't do.

390
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,160
Of course, maybe he does it even though I wish he wouldn't.

391
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,720
And maybe there he does it even though later he wishes he wouldn't.

392
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:33,079
I mean, there's this pro tied up with, presumably, why he doesn't go on with being in time, that he's falling into giving a kind of priority to Dasein and doing what he calls fundamental ontology, which is tracing it all back to the fact that there's a being that takes a stand on it to be.

393
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:38,039
And later he'll see that he gave up being in time because he was falling into the ruts of the tree.

394
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,920
Anyway, let me do it step by step, keeping our eye on the ball as best we can.

395
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,839
To what extent, well, why does he need to bring in temporality tate at all?

396
00:39:48,839 --> 00:40:05,079
If it isn't that he's trying to get the world and Dasein balanced and the ecstasies and the horizons into phenomenon or a structure, probably a phenomenon that has a structure.

397
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,000
Keep track of both of the of us.

398
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:26,040
So he's trying to find a phenomenon that has a structure that is more basic than the structure of Dasein with its ecstasies correlated with horizon.

399
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,919
And that structure is temporality tate.

400
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,559
So let's go on and see if we can do it.

401
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,919
I mean this is so hard.

402
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:42,919
I mean if you can't follow what's going on, I don't know whether it's my fa I mean I'm if it's my fault I'm sorry, but it but i everybody's got to help to try to make it clear.

403
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,839
I I don't think I can do it alone.

404
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:46,999
But let's let's see what we get.

405
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:52,359
Um so I where were we on t uh I was reading 276 way back there.

406
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:55,400
I have to check up or go back.

407
00:40:55,399 --> 00:41:04,800
And I think I did, I read, so there's a lot about understanding there on 276 as coping, of course.

408
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:15,839
And it's in the context of talking about the understanding of being, because the understanding of being is the most basic background coping, I think.

409
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:24,880
That's what I think being in time says, and that's what I think this says on 274, but he says it much more obscurely.

410
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:38,720
And the understanding at the bottom of 276, if understanding is a basic determination of existence, as such it is the condition of the possibility for all of Dasein's particular possible manners of comportment.

411
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,040
It is the condition of the possibility for all kinds of comportment, not only practical but cognitive and so forth.

412
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,399
Now, that can be, that can cut both ways.

413
00:41:48,399 --> 00:42:01,839
I mean, that certainly grounds the understanding of being, it makes the understanding of being a kind of coping, but it makes it all more on the side of Dasein, because it's Dasein that's got this understanding of being.

414
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:08,960
So if he's going to get it out of falling into Dasein, he's got to do something else with it.

415
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,959
And then I wanted to go on to 279.

416
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,920
Well, something that I think is important, though it may turn out not to be.

417
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:20,159
But on 279, I want to read it.

418
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:29,359
This is called the chapter or the section called Existence L understanding, understanding of being, and projection of being.

419
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:36,959
It's still got to do with the relation of the background coping to having an understanding.

420
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:48,600
Now, the Dasein is being in the world, and in equal originality with its facticity, a world is disclosed, and other Daseins are disclosed.

421
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:54,280
And interworldly being, beings like us are disclosed.

422
00:42:55,879 --> 00:43:05,240
The Dasein understands an equal originality, the understanding of existence, the existence of Dasein, and interworldly beings, all of those.

423
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,639
At first, however, now comes the part I want to read.

424
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:16,200
At first, however, the understanding of being, Dasein, and of things extant, extant in here is present at hand in the other.

425
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,959
So let's read again.

426
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:29,240
The understanding of being, of Dasein and of things that are present at hand, is not divided and articulated into specific modes of being, and it is not comprehended as such.

427
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:43,720
Existence, being existent, or that is, that's existence of Dasein, being extant, that is, being present at hand, being handy, that is, the ready-to-hand.

428
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,880
He's listing all the modes of being.

429
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:49,800
These are not conceptually comprehended, each in its own sense of being.

430
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:59,640
They are understood indifferently in an understanding of being that makes possible and guides the experience of nature and the self-apprehension of the history.

431
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:20,679
So what I want to say is, this is again this sort of background finding your way around in the world, which is something which is not separated out, but is uh which makes possible in the sense of guides the our experience of the of everything.

432
00:44:20,999 --> 00:44:28,640
I think all of this is that is all is very similar to being in time, and I don't think it's we need to to read it.

433
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:39,760
It because it's all doing y he did this he's explaining the understanding of being, which is fine, but it's the temporality tate which is one level more basic that we want to get to.

434
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,279
So I'm not going to read that.

435
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,880
Uh I'm going to go to two hundred eighty-nine.

436
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:52,319
Okay, yeah, here's one of these places where it looks like the world gets priority on two eighty-nine, the bottom paragraph.

437
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,919
We understand ourselves by way of things in the sense of the self-understanding of everyday Dasein.

438
00:44:57,919 --> 00:45:10,960
To understand ourselves from the things with which we are occupied means to project our own ability to be upon such features of the business of our everyday occupation as the feasible, urgent, indispensable expedient.

439
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,359
Now that looks like it comes back to us.

440
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:20,880
The Dasein understands itself from the ability to be that is determined by the success and failures of commerce with things.

441
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:26,480
The Dasein thus comes toward itself, this is where it looks like the other side, from out of the things.

442
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:33,280
It expects its own can-be as the can-be of a being that relies on what things give or what they refuse.

443
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,440
That sounds more like these affordances.

444
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:53,040
It is as though the Dasein can can the Dasein's can-be were projected by the things, by Dasein's commerce with them, and not primarily by the Dasein itself from its own peculiar self, which exists and is always dealing with things.

445
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:56,800
Now, I don't know how and why that looks that sounds right.

446
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,319
And that seems like it makes it e equal the way things in Dasein contribute.

447
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,720
I suppose you like that, Tyler, then.

448
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,520
That seems to be doing giving more credit to the things than usual.

449
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:20,040
I think that that's, but I don't know if that, but that keeps getting taken back in such a way that I'm not sure that it's doing a big deal job.

450
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:29,640
It may be just existential, is what this para, what this section is about, but I'd like to use it to say what I wanted to say.

451
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:38,999
So then we get, then I was going to read Being in Time 119, which I read a long time ago, and show you, but nobody doubts it.

452
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:52,999
That what Heidegger was talking about, he calls, but it's just in case you want to look it up, 281 and 282, he talks about the pre-objective, pre-conceptual, and pre-ontological, that that's what he's been talking about.

453
00:46:53,319 --> 00:47:06,279
He talks about openness, functionality, context, significance, and worldhood, openness, and transcendence.

454
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:17,720
Those are all important ways of describing the fact that Dasein is open to and encounters entities.

455
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:26,120
They all seem to me, this is on 299, they all seem to me to be put together in familiarity.

456
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:38,280
The whole list is on 299, where he says about 20 lines down: equipment and the ready to confront us in the horizon of an understood world.

457
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,280
It's coming from the side of the world there.

458
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:42,839
If it's horizon, it's always the side of the world.

459
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:46,679
Equipment and the handy confront us in the horizon of an understood world.

460
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,999
They're encountered always as interworldly beings.

461
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:52,839
The world is understood beforehand when objects are encountered.

462
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:57,200
I didn't, oh, I didn't start, I wanted to start one sentence before that.

463
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:02,720
In dealing with ready-to-hand equipment, Dasein always already understands functionality.

464
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:11,600
That the Dasein returns to beings of that sort only from its antecedent understanding of functionality, contextual significance, and world.

465
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:17,280
Being must stand in the light of understood functionality and so forth.

466
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:25,440
Well, I think that familiarity is a rich notion which means all of that.

467
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,199
All of that is in familiarity.

468
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:33,040
The functionality, the holism, the significance, and worldhood.

469
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:33,999
And that's fine.

470
00:48:33,999 --> 00:48:37,039
I mean, I don't think that's controversial.

471
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:45,280
It's just that in being in time, he just dumps them all into familiarity, and here he sort of spreads them out.

472
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,599
I don't have anything to say about that.

473
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:53,760
And then, oh, yeah, and then come these fast two paragraphs at the end.

474
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:04,400
Just when it looks like he might as well be talking about familiarity, and he's already done it, and he says so on 301, the end of the top long paragraph.

475
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:15,119
We call the unity of these relations the Dasein's being in, with the sense that the Dasein possesses an original familiarity with itself and with others, with entities and extant.

476
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,839
This familiarity is, as such, familiarity in a world.

477
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:25,519
That's the thing is in 119 in Being in Time.

478
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,600
So you can put them all together and call it familiarity.

479
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:38,319
And now comes these fast paragraphs where it turns out that familiarity gets spelled out.

480
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,479
It doesn't seem to be basic.

481
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:46,680
It seems to be spelled out further in the, well, where shall I read it?

482
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,279
In the structural moments.

483
00:49:48,280 --> 00:50:11,720
Now we're back to the ecstatic, the Zeitlikite, and that is the temporality and the temporality faith structure for the last paragraph, where he seems to be getting, I presume, thinks he's getting, is something that explains or makes him eligible familiarity and all these other things he's been talking about.

484
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,839
But I'm going to read some of it.

485
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:22,039
The ecstatic character of time makes possible the Dasein-specific overstepping character, transcendent, and that's also the world.

486
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:26,359
So notice there it's the ecstatic character and you don't even hear about horizons.

487
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:31,720
But of course soon you'll hear that each one has a horizon and that seems like a good idea.

488
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:33,399
So a little further.

489
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:42,600
As removals too, that's because of the ecstatic character of each of them, they have a horizon which is prescribed by the mode of the removal.

490
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,039
And removal is a funny term.

491
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:46,759
It means that you're putting something at a distance.

492
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:53,879
The ecstasy go out to something that is Dasein, which is something in the world.

493
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:00,280
They're carrying away the mode of the future, past, and present, which belongs to the ecstasies themselves.

494
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:18,200
Each ecstasy as a removal to has at the same time within itself, which is odd, because I would like to think that it has it outside itself, but has within itself and belonging to it is a pre-delineation of the formal structure of the where-to of the removal.

495
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:24,280
We call this wither of the ecstasies the horizon for the horizonal schema of the ecstasies.

496
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:30,879
This is all extremely dense, but it seems extremely going in the Kantian wrong direction.

497
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:34,800
It's all it keeps getting ecstasies are what's important.

498
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,720
And then the inside these ecstasies, or implied by them or something, is the world.

499
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:52,159
Each ecstasy has within itself a complete determinate schema, which modifies itself in accordance with the manner in which the temporality temporalizes itself, the manner in which the ecstasies modify themselves.

500
00:51:52,160 --> 00:52:01,759
Just as the ecstasies intrinsically constitute the unity of temporality, so in each case there corresponds to the ecstatic unity of temporality, a unity of the horizonal schema.

501
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,359
Well, that well, you know, that's giving them equal, which is where they should be, it would seem.

502
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:21,039
And then in italics, the transcendence of being in the world means that believing that there's an opening in which there can be intentionality, there can be encountering of entity.

503
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:27,359
That world is more basic than or makes possible the encountering.

504
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:37,440
The transcendence of being in the world is founded in its specific wholeness on the original ecstatic horizonal unity of temporality.

505
00:52:37,439 --> 00:52:40,640
So that's that's pure temporality.

506
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,680
Now comes the next section, where it gets harder.

507
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,440
Temporalitate.

508
00:52:45,919 --> 00:52:49,919
So the title of the next section is, and that's where you start.

509
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,359
Temporality, temporalitate, and being.

510
00:52:53,359 --> 00:53:10,080
So it says, the task now is to comprehend how, on the basis of temporality that grounds Dasein's transcendence, the Dasein's temporality makes possible the understanding of being oh sorry, the Dasein's temporalitate makes possible the understanding of being.

511
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:19,160
So far we've seen that temporality with a lower T makes possible the understanding of being.

512
00:53:19,879 --> 00:53:26,599
And but now temporalitate makes possible the understanding of being.

513
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,159
What's going on?

514
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:28,599
Why do we say it that way?

515
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,880
Let me read it again.

516
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:36,279
On the basis of temporality that grounds the Dasein's temporalitate makes possible.

517
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:45,240
So it's somehow the temporalitate is going to make possible the temporality that makes possible an understanding of being.

518
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,519
I guess we ought to be able to do ontology right off, you mean?

519
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,280
Yeah, I exactly had the same feeling.

520
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:57,399
I hope somebody would if it seems like there's a one level too many of explanation.

521
00:53:57,959 --> 00:54:04,440
We've already got to the to the basis, on the basis of which every kind of intentionality is possible.

522
00:54:04,439 --> 00:54:06,600
Everything that shows up can show up.

523
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,440
There's a clearing, namely, in which they show up, transcendence.

524
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:12,679
And now what in the world if you want more?

525
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,759
I want you guys to help me.

526
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,079
Yeah?

527
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,760
Ooh.

528
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,519
That would be very, very bad.

529
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:23,879
Does he say that?

530
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:26,040
Where's that?

531
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,120
The first sentence?

532
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:39,800
The task now is to comprehend how, on the basis of temporality that grounds the Dasein's transcendence, the Dasein Steitlichkeit makes possible the understanding of being.

533
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,559
So that is really weird.

534
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:41,800
Yes, yes.

535
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,640
On the basis of yeah, go ahead.

536
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,959
Temporality is temporary tape.

537
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:56,559
Sounds like temporality takes the I'm going to give you the German because I mean that first sentence is so strange that companies fit back to Eugene.

538
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,999
The first sentence is so strange that maybe it's wrong.

539
00:54:59,999 --> 00:55:01,839
That that would help.

540
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:21,440
Because I don't understand how, on the basis of the temporality that grounds the Dasein's transcendence, which is just what we've been hearing about for the last twenty pages, the Dasein's temporality tape makes possible the understanding of being.

541
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:23,919
That is an incomprehensible sentence.

542
00:55:23,919 --> 00:55:25,200
That's what it says.

543
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,959
Okay, well, I don't have any idea what that means.

544
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:34,319
On the basis of the fact that Dasein has an understanding of being.

545
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,119
Yes.

546
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,359
And now comes then, how does temporality take turn?

547
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,759
It seems to be on the basis of temporality that temporality take does its job.

548
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,039
How can it be prior?

549
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,319
That's just the Eugene question.

550
00:55:48,319 --> 00:56:06,000
How can it both be prior to it and do it on how can how can temporality be the basis of the understanding of being, also the basis of temporality tape?

551
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,240
That would I mean I get lost.

552
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:11,439
Which is already the condition of the.

553
00:56:12,399 --> 00:56:16,959
We already got starting about how Dasein understands being.

554
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:19,039
Now there's launch of that story.

555
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,640
You look like maybe the Germans helping or something.

556
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,439
And we can't say that he wasn't, that he didn't have time to pro write this book.

557
00:56:33,439 --> 00:56:37,119
I mean, the the it would be easy if this was division II being in time.

558
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,599
We could just say, poor Heidegger that he just didn't have time to finish the manuscript.

559
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,839
But he this is he had plenty of time to finish the manuscript.

560
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:45,479
It took him about fifty years before this was published.

561
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:47,240
I mean, he didn't this didn't get published right away.

562
00:56:47,399 --> 00:56:48,920
This is a course he gave.

563
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:51,239
He could revise it and do whatever he wanted.

564
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,520
Anyway, so he must mean what he says there, but I don't know what it is.

565
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,879
So let's go on.

566
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,479
Maybe it'll get clearer.

567
00:56:57,479 --> 00:56:59,800
It didn't get much clearer to me, I'm afraid.

568
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:01,319
So where are we?

569
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:04,200
On 301, we got there.

570
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,480
Okay, so now adding original very I mean here's my version of it.

571
00:57:09,479 --> 00:57:25,480
Adding the that this originary temporality brings back the threefold character of Dasein's temporality and the correlative temporality of the world and claiming that this ecstatic horizonal temporality is even more basic than familiarity.

572
00:57:25,479 --> 00:57:26,839
Well, that's no, that's all right.

573
00:57:26,999 --> 00:57:33,319
That's that he's been doing, that the horizonal temporality explains even familiarity.

574
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:34,359
We can do that.

575
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:43,399
But it looks like this other stuff that's coming in here about not about not temporality, which is fine.

576
00:57:43,399 --> 00:57:59,400
Remember, that's the name for the way Dasein becomes a clearing or an opening in which you now we've got this news story that we need we need something else, namely temporality tate, and that's what we're trying to understand.

577
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,879
Does it help to read the third sentence?

578
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:03,720
I suppose not, but I'll read anyway.

579
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:29,600
In connection with it, that is temporalitate, we have already we have always already oriented our considerations toward the question of the possibility of specific understanding of being, namely the understanding of being in the sense of of present Wow.

580
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:35,119
If anybody knows anything, if anybody s thinks they've understood this paragraph, they should tell.

581
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:42,240
If not, I'm just going to go on reading it until some you you Tyler's got more to say about this than I think that's right.

582
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,280
That's what he makes it different.

583
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,839
We're gonna account for ontology as one doing ontology.

584
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,039
Yeah, I don't wanna say that.

585
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,680
I mean, I don't know what to say, but that somebody could say that.

586
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,599
Well, I agree.

587
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,120
Being in time.

588
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,760
Here.

589
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,079
Okay.

590
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:10,800
I was thinking of the one in being in time, where the where he gets on he gets to ontology straight from the understanding of being to ontology, the one I read earlier on.

591
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,319
But okay, well I'm sorry, I just got sidetracked.

592
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,519
What's he doing here?

593
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:15,760
Okay.

594
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,479
I don't think that's he accounts.

595
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,599
He really didn't.

596
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,880
I don't think so.

597
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:25,920
Right.

598
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,280
Right.

599
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:31,519
Exactly.

600
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:33,599
That is temporality with small T.

601
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,479
Keep everybody.

602
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,319
Uh something from the point.

603
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:41,680
There are two things but when he talks about that ontology for decentralized internal.

604
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:50,479
So these both words then there's something upon which project and branding thing doesn't well that's nice if we can make that work.

605
00:59:50,479 --> 00:59:51,440
Okay.

606
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:59,200
I think there's and that's part of what you're doing in the process.

607
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,800
That's one line.

608
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,080
Tell us another line.

609
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:06,559
We must have the upon which and also the dialogue is the open thing.

610
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,519
Okay, that's the first one.

611
01:00:31,959 --> 01:00:33,800
He certainly has to go.

612
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:37,879
And he's also saying that there's a condition of possibility of a bad effect.

613
01:00:37,879 --> 01:00:39,560
That's very important.

614
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:44,760
That only because there's something like light, not a certain light, he can provide himself not on the point.

615
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:55,960
Well, it's it's a it's beyond being, the good, as he says.

616
01:00:55,959 --> 01:00:56,519
Yeah.

617
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:00,759
And it's uh like the illumination in the room, this light.

618
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,960
It's the clearing.

619
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:07,400
It's the light which withdraws and lets us make makes everything intelligible.

620
01:01:07,399 --> 01:01:12,120
And why he needs that, which it is all when he hasn't already got it.

621
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,959
But I but I think I see what you mean.

622
01:01:13,959 --> 01:01:27,959
That it's something from outside the practices of Dasein has to provide this illumination in which all the even practices, even the coping which makes us understand being, can only take place in it.

623
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:31,319
I don't I I see that that that's the structure of what he's saying.

624
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:39,639
The possible structure any possible thing by having the Well, okay, I mean Eugene wants to say something about this, I see.

625
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,119
Yes.

626
01:01:40,439 --> 01:01:41,800
274?

627
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,520
Okay, let's go to 274.

628
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:45,800
Against the light version.

629
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:54,439
Temporality take is the predictor of the where where you okay, by the way, you have the German.

630
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,999
Where it says temporalitate in the sentence I just looked at, that is the condition of the possibility of Dasein's being.

631
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:01,359
That's Teiglishkai.

632
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,319
That's right, it's it's he he puts the German in, so then I believe him.

633
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,400
So don't I mean didn't you just read that as if it was temporalitate, or did I mish hear you?

634
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,359
Yeah, what did you read what you said on 274?

635
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:22,159
Ah, okay, wait, I've got to get there.

636
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,160
Its role is the condition.

637
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,720
Yeah.

638
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,879
So then that's interesting, isn't it?

639
01:02:26,879 --> 01:02:36,560
That just says it's the same thing, but if we're giving it a new name because we're giving it a new function, or we're calling attention to a particular function, which in fact we've already described.

640
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,800
And we've described a function.

641
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:44,400
Now we're going to tell you a name for something when it's performing that function.

642
01:02:44,399 --> 01:02:46,879
That boy, does that make it a lot simpler?

643
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:09,440
Why we shouldn't do it, that's just makes one making Tyler go crazy.

644
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,359
Okay, why not?

645
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,080
Yes.

646
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:15,839
But they aren't two different things, this passage says.

647
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:19,440
This passage says it's one thing with diff two different functions.

648
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:23,439
Yeah, and which opens a clearing in which we can encounter entities.

649
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,039
Go ahead and yeah.

650
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,319
Well, we could just be naming them from a p point of view of their function.

651
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,839
One of them opens up a clearing and makes intentionality possible.

652
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,519
That's one function of this.

653
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,880
I'm going to call it from the functionality stuff.

654
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:53,960
And the other, that they're that the familiarity stuff is what makes ontology possible because it's, as you guys kept insisting, has a structure which we can spell out in a in a science of being.

655
01:03:53,959 --> 01:04:00,599
And then we're going to and when we're treating it as something whose structure we can spell out in an ontology, we're going to call it temporality take.

656
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,560
That's that's how Eug Eugene is reading it, I think.

657
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:18,760
And that's it seems like that's what he's saying, but it seems like such a perverse and useless thing to say, to introduce a whole offensely new terminology just to describe a different function that you've been describing already, only you haven't given it this name.

658
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:20,759
Yeah, yeah.

659
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:28,200
Well, I see that if you bring in light, you go you it's not going to be that that we're just renaming things.

660
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:39,159
But he looks as if he just says the role of condition of the possibility of the understanding of being both pre-ontological and ontological we will call temporality take.

661
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:48,200
And then we've been just discussing that role and we discussed it fine in being in time on page 119 without ever having to bring in this technical term.

662
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,239
And that's weird.

663
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,920
But so anybody else who wants to join in, yeah, go ahead.

664
01:04:52,919 --> 01:04:53,720
Wait, where are you?

665
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,200
Where are you?

666
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:56,040
302.

667
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,920
I don't understand what you're saying, but that's probably because I'm not on 302.

668
01:05:00,919 --> 01:05:02,280
Okay, let's go to 302.

669
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,559
Now tell us where you are.

670
01:05:06,439 --> 01:05:11,240
Of temporality, the and there we haven't even gotten to t temporality take.

671
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:13,960
That is not a capital T yet.

672
01:05:13,959 --> 01:05:15,240
Okay, well then what do you adding?

673
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:32,879
Why is he adding this capital instead of are you saying that we need to explain how come that all these horizons, all these ecstasies have horizons and that we sort of need another something or other to explain that?

674
01:05:32,879 --> 01:05:34,479
That would be an interesting move.

675
01:05:34,479 --> 01:05:36,000
Is that what you were saying already?

676
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,160
That seems to be a new possibility.

677
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:45,280
Well, under a new something, let's go, we don't want to call it a new horizon, or we go, he warns that we go into a regress if we do that.

678
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:50,800
But some new something or other, which we call temporality.

679
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,559
But does he ever say that he wants to do that?

680
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,400
I don't remember.

681
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,559
He's certainly not in being in time.

682
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,479
In being in time, he just says, fuck, every ecstasy is a removal.

683
01:06:00,479 --> 01:06:02,240
It must be a removal to something.

684
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,520
Whatever it's a removal to, we're going to call that the horizon.

685
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:07,039
And no problem.

686
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:09,199
And now all of a sudden he's got a problem.

687
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,679
How to get the ecstasies together with the horizons?

688
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,800
Well, if he's got another two years, he could get a new problem.

689
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,119
But I don't see it yet.

690
01:06:17,439 --> 01:06:19,760
Do you define that?

691
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,480
Between ecstasies and the horizons.

692
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,319
Where's the quote?

693
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,440
That's so interesting.

694
01:06:29,439 --> 01:06:31,999
I mean, if that were true, that would certainly be helpful.

695
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:33,359
Would w where do you get that?

696
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:38,879
When Frank is present, it's present.

697
01:06:38,879 --> 01:06:40,639
But nothing wrong with it.

698
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:56,079
That's when I think I got desperate for affordances, that there there's something out there that is soliciting me that as a dog sort of Dasein.

699
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,399
Dasein is coping with something.

700
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:04,640
It's got an ecstatic structure that i enables it to encounter things and cope with them.

701
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:10,800
But things have this other aspect, namely they solicit us to deal with them and cope with them.

702
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:24,119
And that's what temporality tells us: how it fills in the horizon in some phenomenological way as not a projection, but a response to a solicitation.

703
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:26,439
That would be turning him into Marilla Conte.

704
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,399
I would like that.

705
01:07:27,879 --> 01:07:33,879
But I don't know if there's any, and I have down here sort of passages which I think might be read that way.

706
01:07:33,879 --> 01:07:35,079
But I see what you're saying.

707
01:07:36,279 --> 01:07:39,959
Well, I have an idea about how to deal with that as a problem.

708
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:42,359
So let me stop there.

709
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:45,079
Because we need, I'll try to put in some text.

710
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:49,239
But first, I thought I saw another person who wanted to know.

711
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:51,159
Okay, well, then we'll go on.

712
01:07:52,279 --> 01:07:53,800
Let's see where I am.

713
01:07:53,800 --> 01:08:00,919
So we're at the bottom of 302 with that complicated worry about what's going to explain what.

714
01:08:00,919 --> 01:08:05,720
So you think, I gather, tell me your first name again.

715
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,520
Okay, Alex.

716
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:13,560
You think, Alex, that the sentence that comes close to saying what you just said is five lines from the bottom of 302.

717
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:34,119
It must now be shown explicitly how the understanding of the readiness, of readiness to hand is, as such, a world understanding, and how this world understanding, as Dasein's transcendence, is rooted in the ecstatic horizonal constitution of Dasein's temporality.

718
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,279
But he seems to, I mean, I feel doesn't seem to think there's any problem.

719
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:43,319
It's as if he thinks that he just has to do what he's done already and being in time and in here.

720
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,919
How's he going to show?

721
01:08:54,959 --> 01:08:58,399
Wait, temporarily take in being what two different modes of temporal?

722
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,159
Oh yeah, authentic and inauthentic.

723
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:05,119
Tell us how they prepared.

724
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,319
I mean, go ahead, Eugene.

725
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,600
I can see you want to say something.

726
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,480
Well, Alex, go ahead.

727
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,439
On bottom of 305, where at the bottom of the 305?

728
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,680
When we describe the handy, that's starting there.

729
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,039
Okay, now go ahead.

730
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:24,879
Well, let me let's get let we just start over now.

731
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,839
We've already been updating our handyness.

732
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:34,559
This has been understanding a dimension of temporally take.

733
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,439
And it's going to make something intelligible.

734
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,520
You're you're on a on an important track.

735
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,560
What are we going to make it do we understand the handy as a mode of being a quantity?

736
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:51,199
It's this antecedent understanding of the handiness of the handy is we get thanks to temporal hand tape.

737
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,319
The understanding of the handiness is so weird.

738
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,760
I mean, we've understood that since back in the beginning of being in time.

739
01:09:57,999 --> 01:10:05,519
Practically the first thing in being in time tells us that what we encounter most of the time is the handiness of the handy.

740
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,720
Maybe it's understanding the handiness of this of the handy as a way of being.

741
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,919
I'm just trying to desperately generate a problem.

742
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:16,879
Yes, you wanna you gotta generate a problem?

743
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:17,839
No, go ahead.

744
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,039
What are you gonna do?

745
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:19,680
Desi?

746
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:27,600
There's a temporal problem of the trans of the world.

747
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,560
I I mean, I didn't he didn't hear you well enough.

748
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,119
Say it again.

749
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:31,760
I just didn't.

750
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,640
No, he looks like he thinks he solved it in Division Two.

751
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:35,519
Yeah.

752
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:38,879
I don't see where you are, but I'm happy with it.

753
01:10:38,919 --> 01:10:40,919
Three oh three, did you sentence?

754
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,359
Three oh two.

755
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,239
The second sentence.

756
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,600
The ecstatic character.

757
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,560
I see.

758
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,919
Uh of of sorry oh oh I see.

759
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:49,720
Oh, I got it now.

760
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,279
Okay, the most original temporality patent makes possible the understanding of being.

761
01:10:54,279 --> 01:11:01,399
The most original temporalizing of temporality as such is it's like the thing redefining again.

762
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:14,440
It's saying that that aspect of temporalizing, which we've already discussed, we're now going to f focus on that aspect and then we're going to call it uh t temporal temporality.

763
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,560
Yeah, that's right.

764
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:22,439
And a bit it's calling it giving it a new name because now we're interested in its uh what?

765
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,159
How it does that.

766
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,680
How it does it.

767
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,319
Okay.

768
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,239
Yeah, you Alex again.

769
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,239
Whoa, whoa, whoa, doesn't it to me?

770
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:33,800
I th where do you see the okay, where on three oh five?

771
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,519
Okay.

772
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:39,239
I never found that sentence.

773
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:40,519
Tell me again where it is.

774
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,079
I see.

775
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:41,560
Way down.

776
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,440
Okay, just a second now.

777
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,319
The now is but that's a way off different issue.

778
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:48,680
I mean that tells you how wrong all the traditional people have been.

779
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,800
Period.

780
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:57,959
Yeah, but he y he's he's got to do be doing more than answering the tradition because that got answered in being in time already.

781
01:11:57,959 --> 01:12:05,239
I mean that we aren't going to have any super supra temporal now theory doing the job of explaining worldhood.

782
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:07,559
But and he's just giving it a new name.

783
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,079
I think that's what we're converging.

784
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:09,800
Well I see.

785
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,440
Tyler, we can't there's a so they're well so why not Tyler?

786
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,560
I don't I don't know what to think.

787
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,199
I'm I'll stay I'm neutral with that.

788
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:25,319
It it's a name for primordial temporality under the description of basic parontology something.

789
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:34,239
We should not allow ourselves to class and these people can go find because they're both just people different.

790
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:42,720
And whenever we hear formulaism, temporality is primarily saying they're both temporal because they were the same.

791
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,919
Okay, well then we have to understand what we've added.

792
01:12:47,919 --> 01:12:50,800
So either okay.

793
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,600
Yeah, well that that does seem like he might be doing that, yeah.

794
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,359
It would be nice.

795
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:15,359
I'm just bringing in my desire to find phenomena that I can already understand if the he was saying both that we need to understand sort of how the world solicits us to make our projections.

796
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:21,839
That would be the affordance, you know, the solicitation story.

797
01:13:21,839 --> 01:13:30,159
And the light would be something like the the holistic bunch of all the affordances.

798
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:32,640
I mean, there would be two things.

799
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:39,039
We need to understand how existential particular things solicit us to cope with them.

800
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:46,959
And we need to understand how there is some holistic background in which all these particular ones are intelligible.

801
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:48,159
That's the light.

802
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:51,119
Is that sort of the structure you would like?

803
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,199
Well, I want some content for the light.

804
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,319
That's what I'm struggling for.

805
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,839
I want to know what phenomenon it is.

806
01:13:55,839 --> 01:13:56,879
It isn't Plato.

807
01:13:57,119 --> 01:13:58,159
We agree.

808
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:59,279
He's an awesome problem.

809
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,479
Well, I yeah, that is what?

810
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,600
It's the clearing in that there.

811
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,999
And the clearing seems to be the same as the light.

812
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,839
So is that what you mean?

813
01:14:09,839 --> 01:14:30,839
It has the horizons and it's the background, the sort of intelligibility that's the I wrote in my margin, where is it that where it sounded just like the clearing when he talked about the light, and he calls it where's the light talk at Plato talk.

814
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:38,680
When he finally sort of transforms Plato into his own story, somebody must be able to find it, it goes on for several pages.

815
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,199
I lost it completely.

816
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:41,399
You got it?

817
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,119
What?

818
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,879
282.

819
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:49,479
Is that where he got the pl he gets to Plato at the oh, here it is, 281.

820
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:58,839
For I got near the top, five lines down, for I can comport towards beings only if those beings can themselves be encountered in the brightness of the understanding of being.

821
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:04,440
This is the necessary condition in terms of fundamental ontology.

822
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:12,839
It can be expressed by saying that all understanding is essentially related to an affective self-finding which belongs to the understanding itself.

823
01:15:12,839 --> 01:15:21,079
It's funny, it goes off into talking about mood and stuff at that point, which is not is that what you think is okay for what you want to say?

824
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:34,519
Okay, no, it needed to make clear how immediately in our attempt to get beyond being to the light from which and in which it itself comes into the brightness of the unundering, we are moving is one of one of Plato's fundamental problems.

825
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:42,760
I'm going to give a wild interpretation of this, which I will mean don't don't all throw things at me.

826
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:48,279
But I mean, uh in there is one issue which he could be worrying about.

827
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:49,999
I'm going to try to spell this out.

828
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:52,599
Which has not been faced at all.

829
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,559
And that is, well, how are we conscious of all this?

830
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:58,079
Of course, he's not going to be able to say that.

831
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:05,279
That's consciousness doesn't show up in the book at all, except in the one of the last sentences of Being in Time, in which he says we ought to talk about it sometime.

832
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:10,079
But so he's not going to say how are we going to become conscious of all this, but that's got to do with the illumination.

833
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,039
It's sort of, well, what is it?

834
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,239
Let's try next.

835
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,079
Well, how do we become aware of all this?

836
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:17,279
Well, that's getting closer.

837
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:26,800
If you're not aware of the equipment and aware of the present-at-hand stuff and aware of the affordances, you're nowhere.

838
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,760
And he hasn't talked about it because he wants to stay out of that.

839
01:16:29,999 --> 01:16:32,079
That's falling back into Descartes.

840
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:33,279
So it's not awareness.

841
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:35,680
Though let's back a little paper.

842
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:39,839
Maybe he's talking about the way you have to take account of the door.

843
01:16:39,839 --> 01:16:41,999
Remember, I talked about this a lot earlier.

844
01:16:41,999 --> 01:16:53,359
As you do the to go out, even though you don't have to notice the door, be aware of the door, be a conscious of the door, nonetheless, the door had better be maybe illuminated for you.

845
01:16:53,360 --> 01:17:00,879
I mean, you can't go out the door if in some sense you haven't picked it up in its intelligibility as the to go out.

846
01:17:00,879 --> 01:17:03,199
So I copied my favorite sentence in here.

847
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:10,079
What is first of all given, and he says every once in a while that he's talking about what is antecedently there.

848
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:16,239
So what is first of all given is the forewriting, for going in and out, for sitting.

849
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:23,119
This writing, going in and out, sitting and the like is what we are a priori involved with, what we know when we know our way around.

850
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:46,680
Maybe this is the story of the way we are taking account of all the stuff he's been writing about as we know our way around in the world, and he can't call it consciousness or awareness or noticing, so he'll call it the way our illumination, the way our activity is illuminated.

851
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,319
Does that make you how do you feel about it?

852
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,239
Is that what Being in Time says?

853
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:51,879
I don't know.

854
01:17:51,879 --> 01:17:53,239
I don't find it in Being in Time.

855
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,720
Yes, I think it is, except that it is and it isn't.

856
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:08,919
It manages to talk about all the time somehow their showing up, but it doesn't really talk about the what it is for them to show up or something like that.

857
01:18:08,919 --> 01:18:15,159
It just and now I guess I'm not sure he's talked about it now, given it a new name, illumination, and so forth.

858
01:18:15,159 --> 01:18:32,199
But it looks like, I mean, I'm just trying to say the only thing I can think of that he hasn't talked about already in Being in Time explicitly, even in a formal way, is the fact that we are in some way or another aware or taking account of all this.

859
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:33,640
How does it show up in Being in Time?

860
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,279
What language is it?

861
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:37,159
Minus.

862
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,680
I doubt it.

863
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,999
I think minus is more on the side of authenticity and it has to do with my calling.

864
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:46,999
This is a a different comment.

865
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:51,879
Well, yeah, I I think well this is some of you are going to find this a little off the beam for a minute.

866
01:18:51,879 --> 01:18:59,800
But I think everybody's got a calling, even when they're uh not listening to the calling of their silent conscience, letting the one drown it out.

867
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:05,959
So I think mine I think minus is way over in that sort of existentialist thing.

868
01:19:05,959 --> 01:19:07,239
I don't think it's mine now.

869
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:13,879
It seems odd to think that it's minus just that I'm taking account of the door as I respond to the two go out.

870
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:17,480
It doesn't seem very mine to the two go out, the two go out.

871
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,600
Anybody's two go out.

872
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:22,279
It it it could be a very Dasman two go out.

873
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:31,999
So I want I want something like how it is that we are taking account of all this, how it is that these things are showing up.

874
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:42,479
But I must say, I don't see the temporality really contributes anything to how things are showing up except name it, or the illumination maybe names it.

875
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:43,919
Alex again.

876
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,119
Yeah?

877
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,159
Yes?

878
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,119
How do you even find it?

879
01:19:53,839 --> 01:19:56,879
It worries me only that I don't see that it's explaining anything.

880
01:19:56,879 --> 01:19:58,959
It just seems to be naming something.

881
01:19:58,959 --> 01:20:01,039
But he thinks, so we've got to be careful.

882
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:05,279
I mean, he thinks that he's doing something besides just rename familiarity.

883
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:10,640
He thinks he's explaining something about familiarity which he hasn't explained before.

884
01:20:10,879 --> 01:20:12,879
But I can only say one more thing.

885
01:20:12,879 --> 01:20:33,039
I mean, the two things it seems to me he hasn't explained, but I'm not sure I can map them onto what he's worrying about, is the holism of all these practices, how they all hang together in one unified world that we can find our way around in instead of just being coping with hammers over here and with people in the classroom, you know.

886
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:40,879
And so there's some unified phenomenon called world, and I don't know if he thinks that he's done a unifell story about that.

887
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:42,079
Yeah.

888
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,440
No, not yet.

889
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,159
I want to go on.

890
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:44,800
What?

891
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,800
Wait, the two of the two.

892
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:59,199
And the other one is, again, I think that he's put something like the awareness of it, as we find our way around in the world, we're responding to the to go in and out and so forth.

893
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:05,760
And there must be some way that we're, I hate to say it, experiencing them, and that he wants to do something.

894
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,480
But I don't understand, I'm afraid, how the temporality tape story does something for either.

895
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,159
Jason, yeah.

896
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:22,839
Through history, our practices have become more and more interdefined and unified.

897
01:21:22,839 --> 01:21:25,959
Possibly that would be a Hegel-like move.

898
01:21:26,919 --> 01:21:29,239
But that's not, that's an epistemological question.

899
01:21:29,239 --> 01:21:30,119
That doesn't interest.

900
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,760
Well, it's not how do we account for it.

901
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,319
How is it how does it show up for us?

902
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,959
What is it for it to show up for us?

903
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,640
That's one.

904
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,439
And what is it to be integrated in a referential whole?

905
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,720
I mean, of significance.

906
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:53,800
I've got quotes about this where it looks like the Zeitlikai has something to do with the significance story.

907
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,839
But anyway, you want to say something, and then I'll get back to my quotes.

908
01:21:56,839 --> 01:22:02,839
Daseine in its unity, but how about the world in its unity, the world that I'm finding my way around in, which he talks about?

909
01:22:03,879 --> 01:22:14,839
Yeah, but somehow the unity of Daseine, namely what it gets when it's authentic, it seems like you can't get out of that the way all these practices hang together so that I can find my way around in a world.

910
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,959
Oh, that unity, yes, self and world get unity.

911
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:32,680
When he's got it, the way we, yes, he says stealth and world are just two aspects of the phenomena being in the world, and that's we are the world existingly story.

912
01:22:32,999 --> 01:22:34,359
We did all that.

913
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:43,640
We did it without asking just how we are aware of.

914
01:22:44,039 --> 01:22:49,720
What I'm trying to put in there, I mean, we are the the world existingly, yes, that is.

915
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,839
And what does that mean?

916
01:22:50,839 --> 01:23:02,560
It means at least this, that we're defined by a for the sake of which, and the practices all end up in a for the sake of which, and it's the same for the sake of which, we're going through it, and therefore it's unity unified.

917
01:23:02,879 --> 01:23:04,399
That's fine.

918
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:12,640
But I still think if you need a kind of question, you know, but how are all the how come all the particular practices add up to one world of s significance?

919
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,239
Where did that come from?

920
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:24,399
That doesn't seem to follow from the fact that there's a bunch of for the sake of witches out here, so to speak, and a bunch of Daseins taking stands on their being.

921
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,879
How come that message like that?

922
01:23:26,879 --> 01:23:30,399
But that that the temporality tate answers that is right out.

923
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,439
I mean, I don't know.

924
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,959
I don't see how it answers it.

925
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,959
If anything, maybe names it.

926
01:23:34,959 --> 01:23:36,079
I saw a hand over here.

927
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:36,480
Did I?

928
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:36,800
Did I?

929
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,359
I think the practices are the world.

930
01:23:43,600 --> 01:24:03,039
I mean, when you find your way when you find your way around in the world, you find your way in not just practices, in a coherent, interrelated stuff of practices, equipment, other people, roles defined by the one.

931
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:06,079
All that goes to make up the phenomenon of world.

932
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:12,560
Well, I think it's you weren't I see what you mean.

933
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:20,640
But I maybe it's more what I said to Eugene is appropriate, not that the practices are all unified, because maybe they aren't.

934
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:30,959
Maybe they're practices of the, I don't know, the the bikers, which just aren't unified with the practices of of uh of the Christians or something.

935
01:24:30,959 --> 01:24:53,319
So but but maybe the right thing is to say we want to understand better how self and world are unified and and why it should be obvious that there's a there's a for the sake of which for every per every Dasein and an in order to for all the streams of equipment and the streams of equipment and the and Daseins all get connected in in a way that make that works.

936
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:59,480
But I'm not sure that what to make of that because I don't think he's got an answer to that, if that is a real question even.

937
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,279
Well, I did.

938
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:05,239
I mean I sort of accepted it without saying clearly enough that I accepted it.

939
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:16,279
Yeah, that's when I said, you know, maybe the bikers and the Christians aren't really unified, but a lot of is the Zittlichkeit, the customs that have come down to us, have gotten more and more integrated.

940
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:18,439
I call that the Hegelian sort of thing.

941
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:29,239
So that's so when you ask sort of how come all the practices don't get in the way of each other, you can tell a historical, sociological, Dasmanic story.

942
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,359
Pragmatic.

943
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,959
So then, but I stick to the other thing.

944
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:37,479
I mean, I think he's got a problem of how he just neatly made self and world connect.

945
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:38,520
But I don't know.

946
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:42,119
Let me let me take time, because I'm going to be unhappy if time runs out.

947
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:49,319
I have quotes that sort of, sort of go in the direction I'm trying to go, so I want to at least read them, and then we can see if they do or don't work.

948
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,159
So let me find out where I am.

949
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:57,800
So do we, I mean, we are all agreeing that temporality grounds familiarity, which grounds the understanding of being.

950
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:04,760
Are we in spite of those weird sentences in which it isn't clear how they all relate?

951
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:14,439
Temporality is that on the basis in which there is familiarity, and on the basis of familiarity, we encounter the various ways of being.

952
01:26:14,999 --> 01:26:15,480
Never mind.

953
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,039
That's regressing into our discussion in our discussion.

954
01:26:18,199 --> 01:26:19,559
I want to go where I am now.

955
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,279
So we got to present on 309.

956
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:26,319
This is in the actual reading, so everybody could feel at home now.

957
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,039
This is the stuff that you supposedly tried to understand.

958
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:32,159
But here's an interesting one.

959
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:40,959
Under light of our discussion, it now seems to me to be, mean something different than I would have thought, namely, what's happening with this?

960
01:26:40,959 --> 01:26:43,199
Is it still recording what we're talking about?

961
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:44,720
It looks like it is.

962
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,199
Yeah.

963
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:45,760
Okay.

964
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:52,879
At the top of 309, I now think this isn't what I thought it was.

965
01:26:52,879 --> 01:26:57,999
I thought it was, well, let's read it and see what it is.

966
01:26:57,999 --> 01:27:23,359
The handiness of the handy, the being of this kind of beings, is understood as presence, presence which, as non-conceptually understandable, is already unveiled in the self-projection of temporality by means of those temporalizing, anything like existent, by means of whose temporalizing, anything like existent commerce with entities, handy and extent becomes possible.

967
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:33,039
So that, I mean, I marked that, I guess, because I couldn't tell whether that presence is sort of temporality paid, right?

968
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:45,279
So it looked like now he could be contributing something new there, but I haven't understood it there yet, because I don't see what's being added.

969
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:47,839
So I was going on trying to find out.

970
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:51,760
It seems like what makes our openness to familiarity possible, I said.

971
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,319
Let's see if we can add to that.

972
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,119
What could that be?

973
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:59,919
Ah, yeah, well, here I am going off into this thing, which I already did, but I hope maybe I've got pages now.

974
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:03,199
Then I said, we're awareness of things.

975
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,560
We're going to describe the pathway.

976
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,279
I thought I sort of understood something, was 309.

977
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:14,999
And it looked like for a while there was a phenomenon he was talking about, about two-thirds of the way down.

978
01:28:14,999 --> 01:28:23,319
And it was when he says he's going to talk about presence and absence and affordances, I think, something like affordances.

979
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:34,999
So on page 309 in the second paragraph, about 15 lines down, we do not always and continually have explicit perception of the things surrounding us in a familiar environment.

980
01:28:34,999 --> 01:28:42,039
See, that got me off thinking, gee, he understands that we sometimes have explicit perception of the things in our environment.

981
01:28:42,039 --> 01:28:47,800
That sounds like Merleau-Ponty more than Heidegger even mentioning that we perceive the things.

982
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:53,640
And then he says, going on, certainly not in such a way that we would be aware of them expressly as handy.

983
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,879
So now we're going to talk about awareness.

984
01:28:55,879 --> 01:29:08,839
And we're going to say, well, we're aware of handy things, you know, ready-to-hand things, but of course we're not explicitly perceiving them, that is, noticing them, nor are we aware of them as handy.

985
01:29:08,839 --> 01:29:10,760
That's this business of the two go-out.

986
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,999
You don't have to notice the door.

987
01:29:12,999 --> 01:29:16,839
You don't have to be aware that it's a functioning equipment.

988
01:29:16,839 --> 01:29:28,519
It is precisely because an explicit awareness and assurance of their being at hand does not occur that we have them around us in a peculiar way just as they are in themselves.

989
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,560
Well, that's good.

990
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:42,919
I mean, that's just to say that we've got them around us and we cope with them and we take account of them, but we don't have to be explicitly aware of them.

991
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:51,879
In the indifferent, imperturbableness of our customary commerce with them, they become accessible precisely with regard to their unobtrusive presence.

992
01:29:51,879 --> 01:30:06,079
Well, all of that is already in being in time, but it looks like he's coming back to this issue, and it looks like it is a kind of story about how we, I want to say in some minimal way, take account of the things that we cope with.

993
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:14,079
The presupposition for the possibility of the possible equanimity of our dealing with things is, among others, the uninterrupted quality of the commerce.

994
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:16,800
It must not be held up in progress.

995
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,079
That's fine.

996
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,680
In Dewey language, he's talking about ongoing coping.

997
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,800
It's amazing how similar they are at that point.

998
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:30,800
At the basis of this undisturbed imperturbability of our commerce with things, there lies a peculiar temporality.

999
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,919
Well, now we're going to see if we can get Zeitlischke in here.

1000
01:30:33,919 --> 01:30:41,919
A peculiar temporality which makes us possible to take a handy equipment or context here in such a way that we lose ourselves in it.

1001
01:30:41,919 --> 01:30:51,760
So he said already in being in time that we, when we're coping, are absorbed and lose ourselves in the hammering or whatever.

1002
01:30:51,760 --> 01:31:06,079
Now he says that I don't know whether it really answers anything, but there's a peculiar temporality, a peculiar dimension of temporality tate, which is what makes it possible for us to lose ourselves in things when we cope with them.

1003
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:07,999
At least there's a phenomenon there.

1004
01:31:07,999 --> 01:31:13,279
I don't understand what he's doing but naming it, but he's got something there.

1005
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:14,239
So let's go on.

1006
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:18,239
The temporality of dealing with equipment is primarily and presenting.

1007
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:26,479
But according to what was previously said, there belongs to it a specific presidential constitution of the horizon of the present.

1008
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,079
So we're in the horizon business.

1009
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:32,959
This is all sort of as near Merle-Ponte as Heidegger's ever going to get.

1010
01:31:32,959 --> 01:31:43,879
So we're the Constitution of the Horizon of the Present on the basis of which the specific presence of the handy, in distinction, say, from the merely present at hand, becomes antecedently intelligible.

1011
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:45,079
There's the antecedently.

1012
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:55,479
I mean, so what is first of all given is us immersing ourselves in going out the door.

1013
01:31:56,999 --> 01:32:03,800
I think that's the bottom line, and maybe it's more bottom, maybe, than anything he says in Being in Time.

1014
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:14,359
The undisturbed character of imperturbable commerce with the handy becomes visible as such if we contrast it with the disturbed quality and so forth.

1015
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:15,319
Well, that's it.

1016
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:18,279
So has he added anything to being in time?

1017
01:32:18,279 --> 01:32:47,959
Has he told us that at least that there is a that we have to explain absorption and ongoing coping and capacity, it's a capacity we've got, and we're going to call it and we're going to focus on it because it's a capacity we've got that lets us take account of the horizon, what the horizon removes itself to.

1018
01:32:47,959 --> 01:32:54,919
So we now get to take account of and get absorbed in the ready-to-hand.

1019
01:32:54,919 --> 01:32:56,839
That's very balanced.

1020
01:32:56,839 --> 01:32:59,479
That's part of temporality tape.

1021
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,560
Is that, I mean, I don't think I'm making it up.

1022
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:05,319
I'm just not sure that it's getting us anywhere that we weren't already.

1023
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,159
I'm going to just finish.

1024
01:33:07,159 --> 01:33:12,359
I've almost got to where I so there's one more move, just as long as I've got them all.

1025
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:21,959
There's another thing that he's going to add here that I don't think he ever added, which is how it is that we deal with things that are absent, equipment that is absent.

1026
01:33:21,959 --> 01:33:24,039
He says we experience it as absent.

1027
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:25,680
It gets in the way and all that.

1028
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:30,239
But then he starts asking on 311 about the phenomenon of absence.

1029
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:41,680
That is, there has to be some kind of expectation for something to be experienced as absent.

1030
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:49,680
And that is in titalics, the top of 3.11, a specifically modified horizon of the presence of presence.

1031
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:56,079
And what it seems to be, it's a special horizon called absence, now all spelled funny.

1032
01:33:56,079 --> 01:34:31,119
And I think that is, and then skipping a little, if circumspection letting function were not from the very outset an expectance, and if this expectance did not temporalize itself as an ecstasis, an ecstatical unity within presenting itself as a pertinent horizonal schema, if that weren't all there, antecedently unveiled, first of all given in the ecstatic unity, if Dasein, that couldn't happen if Dasein were not a temporal Dasein in the original sense and so forth.

1033
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:43,279
So I think all that means is that we have a kind of readiness, along with the fact that things solicit us and let us become absorbed in them.

1034
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:45,919
That's one of the things that happens that he's talking about.

1035
01:34:45,919 --> 01:34:55,279
When the things aren't there that we are ready to deal with and become absorbed in, then we have a kind of readiness, and he's never talked about that.

1036
01:34:55,360 --> 01:35:05,599
Kind of readiness which is our relation to something absent which we were expecting would be present to account for something experienced as missing.

1037
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:11,640
And maybe, I mean, what I'm happy about is at least I think I see the phenomenon is near the surface for a change.

1038
01:35:11,959 --> 01:35:23,559
Now, if we can just relate those phenomena to some, or to what temporality tate is supposed to enable us to understand that we haven't understood before, we'd be in good faith.

1039
01:35:23,959 --> 01:35:26,519
Does anybody want, yeah, okay, Alex.

1040
01:35:27,959 --> 01:35:29,239
Okay, sounds plausible.

1041
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:31,800
That's what I'm saying, too.

1042
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:32,439
It's missing.

1043
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:39,239
And how could it be missing if, unless we had a readiness and expectance, as he calls it, to use it?

1044
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:43,239
And that's somehow going to be called presence.

1045
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:51,239
That's a dimension of primordial temporality, which he hasn't talked about in Being in Time.

1046
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,039
That's all I can say about it.

1047
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:55,319
And you better have it.

1048
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:08,279
And if you have a notion of presence and absence, these two funny words, then you have a way of explaining the use of the ready-to-hand, which he hadn't explained in Being in Time.

1049
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:11,959
And so that there's some excuse for giving them a new name.

1050
01:36:11,959 --> 01:36:16,519
I mean, at least they're new phenomena that he's introducing.

1051
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:25,239
And he's claiming, I don't find it very explanatory, but he's claiming that some, what are you going to call it?

1052
01:36:25,239 --> 01:36:31,800
Some, I don't want to say structure after all the trouble I went to to get rid of structure.

1053
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:32,600
Some what?

1054
01:36:35,079 --> 01:36:41,879
Some aspect of Dasein's coping capacity, something like that, is what he's interested in.

1055
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:45,479
And presence allows him to describe aspects.

1056
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,640
It's a rich phenomenon, remember, he said.

1057
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:55,800
So, why doesn't it include readiness, for instance, and solicitations and significance, which is how they're all interrelated?

1058
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:03,439
All of that has to go into our finding something either ready to hand or missing.

1059
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,239
He just produces missing in being in time.

1060
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:08,720
He doesn't say, well, how can Dasein cope?

1061
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,480
How can Dasein experience missing?

1062
01:37:12,879 --> 01:37:17,199
I find myself talking in awareness and experience terms, but I think it's all right.

1063
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,399
Okay.

1064
01:37:18,959 --> 01:37:21,279
Now, you want to say something right?

1065
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:21,760
Really?

1066
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:23,760
I was trying to do that.

1067
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:25,279
Well, I see.

1068
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:28,399
Well, I guess I want to put presence on the side of the world.

1069
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,079
That's the affordance side.

1070
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:31,919
That's definitely on the side of the world.

1071
01:37:31,919 --> 01:37:36,079
But I do want to put readiness on the side, the absence part on the side of Dasein.

1072
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:43,439
A real alteration in the way the world shows up.

1073
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:46,319
Yes, that's good.

1074
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:46,879
That's good.

1075
01:37:46,879 --> 01:37:47,359
That's good.

1076
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,760
The world looks like it lacks something.

1077
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,999
That's in the look of the world.

1078
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,919
How about I'll meet you halfway?

1079
01:37:55,919 --> 01:37:58,959
How about a correlation between that and our activity?

1080
01:37:58,959 --> 01:38:03,439
Because we have to have a readiness or thing, or the world isn't going to look different.

1081
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:06,159
I was ready to, I got to switch to SART.

1082
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:09,119
How many know the famous SART stuff about Pierre in the cafe?

1083
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:09,600
Anybody?

1084
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,239
He obviously got it from Heidegger.

1085
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:15,919
Well, I don't know, he didn't read this, so maybe he got it from the phenomena.

1086
01:38:15,919 --> 01:38:25,919
But anyway, once you're looking for Pierre in the cafe, now in my terms, you've got this readiness to see Pierre, and he isn't there.

1087
01:38:25,919 --> 01:38:27,439
And now everything looks different.

1088
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,999
The cafe looks like it lacks Pierre.

1089
01:38:29,999 --> 01:38:31,439
And it looks like it takes both.

1090
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:40,359
It takes something on from the side of the world, namely the the world without him, and it takes something on the side of us, namely readiness to see him.

1091
01:38:39,999 --> 01:38:41,319
And that's all right.

1092
01:38:41,879 --> 01:38:50,680
I mean, uh I think it's enough if Heidegger keeps, you know, the world side in there and doesn't reduce it to the readiness which I almost did.

1093
01:38:50,999 --> 01:38:51,720
What was the other thing?

1094
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,439
Oh yeah, and the two go in and out and so forth.

1095
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,519
That's certainly on the side of the world.

1096
01:38:56,839 --> 01:39:10,119
And if I'm in the uh and if I'm dealing with things as two go out, then he has to have a story about how that I can do that without.

1097
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:11,800
I'm projecting going out.

1098
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,879
I'm trying to think of the parallel.

1099
01:39:13,879 --> 01:39:23,559
And I'm projecting going out, and that amounts to respo and the world then shows up as two go out, and I respond to the two go out.

1100
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:29,399
I mean, if I if I'm not projecting going out, then the door doesn't show up as the two go out.

1101
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:41,319
But I can project all I want about of two going out, and if there isn't any door, then there won't be any experience of anything affording going out.

1102
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,999
You've got to have both again.

1103
01:39:43,320 --> 01:40:05,239
So I would like to think that Frisant's and thereby as an example of temporalitate is an example of the phenomenon that he wants to get at as the basic way Dasein, in coping, Daseine is the world existingly.

1104
01:40:05,239 --> 01:40:08,039
It has a lot of structure, and he's trying to tell us.

1105
01:40:08,039 --> 01:40:18,279
Well, the question is, how does that relate to what he says about the temporalitate as the sort of more fundamental phenomenon than temporality?

1106
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:27,039
It is more fundamental, but in a kind of phenomenological way which might not be appropriate for this very abstract discussion.

1107
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:28,560
I go, no.

1108
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:30,959
Tyler probably thinks it's it's not.

1109
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:32,399
What?

1110
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,159
I know we're at the extremes of formal and phenomenal now.

1111
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:36,560
Okay.

1112
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:44,720
Well, why?

1113
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,839
I mean, that's interesting.

1114
01:40:45,839 --> 01:40:48,159
Well, but why leave it formal?

1115
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:54,559
I mean, it's, I think there's nothing wrong with it being formal, but then, and maybe that's all he's saying in here.

1116
01:40:54,560 --> 01:41:00,319
But, I mean, once you've got the form, I think you're saying somehow we can't fill it in.

1117
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:03,999
The phenomenon couldn't live up to what the form is asking it to be.

1118
01:41:03,999 --> 01:41:05,839
And I want to say, sure, we can fill it in.

1119
01:41:05,839 --> 01:41:07,119
I just filled it in.

1120
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:09,119
And but and you why not?

1121
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:10,399
But you might be right.

1122
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,600
He isn't filling it in.

1123
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:20,879
I'm putting it in with something wrong with what I filled it in, with something that too objectified it or conceptualized it or something.

1124
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:28,079
I'm trying to see if I get used to it and it's okay with me.

1125
01:41:28,879 --> 01:41:30,640
I'm part of the world.

1126
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:34,079
And don't see that as I'm practicing.

1127
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,279
Okay, I agree.

1128
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:39,760
And I think, I mean, and that I would say is the minimal, at least this much.

1129
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:52,800
You know, in a formal way, Heidegger is trying to fight his way out of idealism, namely grounding it in temporality with a small T, which is a structure of Dase Einstein activity.

1130
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:57,039
That's and he's trying to explain why or how or that.

1131
01:41:57,199 --> 01:42:03,519
I guess maybe that there is always a horizon tied up with every activity.

1132
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,640
He needs that too.

1133
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,640
He's got this phenomenon of something being missing.

1134
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:22,199
Once you've got gone that far toward the phenomenon, it seems to me you ought to be able to allow to go on and give the phenomenon that makes something missing, that makes it possible to experience something that's missing.

1135
01:42:22,199 --> 01:42:28,039
But anyway, certainly the formal thing is in there, and I'm glad.

1136
01:42:28,039 --> 01:42:35,800
And I want to fill in the phenomenon because I just, if there is such a formal something or other, then either.

1137
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:39,159
But this is what I just realized listening to Tyler.

1138
01:42:39,159 --> 01:42:41,159
I mean, there are two possibilities again.

1139
01:42:41,159 --> 01:42:54,919
Either Heidegger just isn't telling us, because it's not his business to write the phenomenology of perception and so forth, or it's something we can't think and conceptualize and point to.

1140
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:56,599
I think that's more what you think.

1141
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:06,919
And that would be something like the way the time-free movements of nature can only show up for us in the clock and already counted as nows.

1142
01:43:06,919 --> 01:43:11,879
And you can't talk about or think about or make intelligible the time-free movements of nature.

1143
01:43:11,879 --> 01:43:14,439
They are unintelligible, Heidegger says.

1144
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:22,760
They just have to be there to get to mesh with our concerns in order for there to be a clock, in order that we can count the nows.

1145
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:34,039
And maybe here again, we're going to say something like, well, you can't really talk about what it is about Dasein that makes it able to experience something that's missing, which I call readiness.

1146
01:43:34,039 --> 01:43:36,839
That's too psychological and too much cognitive science.

1147
01:43:36,839 --> 01:43:38,279
We don't know about that.

1148
01:43:38,279 --> 01:43:47,479
But there has to be something that Dasein is open to when something is missing.

1149
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:52,439
And we can't say anything more about how Dasein has that openness.

1150
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,319
That's what you think.

1151
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:54,599
And that might be true.

1152
01:43:54,919 --> 01:43:55,839
That's fine.

1153
01:43:55,839 --> 01:43:59,039
And then, and the other one was what?

1154
01:43:55,400 --> 01:44:00,959
Oh, the affordances.

1155
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:05,039
Again, maybe that's who existenciel.

1156
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:14,560
After all, we want to stay on the level, if we want to stay on the level of world, that's not what we can do, but we shouldn't stay on the level of world.

1157
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:19,919
The surprise then story is on the level of coping with particular equipment, it seems to me.

1158
01:44:19,919 --> 01:44:31,919
And if it is, then you want to know how that particular equipment manifests itself to Dasein or something like that.

1159
01:44:31,919 --> 01:44:35,359
Then I want to talk about solicitation.

1160
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:43,039
But then I want to say, well, Heidegger, instead of saying Heidegger says you can't talk about it, Heidegger just is not in the business of talking about it.

1161
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:50,800
He's not going to give a cognitivist account of the existenciel fact that, what now?

1162
01:44:51,119 --> 01:45:02,479
That there is on the side of the world, if I don't say solicitations, what do I say?

1163
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,599
It's all right?

1164
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,480
Okay, then there is on the side of the world affordances.

1165
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,239
That's fine with me.

1166
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:10,879
Okay, it's just time to stop.

1167
01:45:10,879 --> 01:45:19,199
Unless somebody has some amazing thing to say that will make all this illuminating more than it is already, I think we will.
