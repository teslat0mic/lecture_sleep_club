1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
And the overview of the issue for today is still whether Heidegger is a temporal idealist.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,639
Or still, I guess we didn't have that yet.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,559
And did we have it at the end last time?

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,840
I don't remember.

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,319
We did.

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,200
Okay.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,520
Does temporality depend on Dasein?

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,639
And then does nature time depend on Dasein?

9
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,039
Yes, we got up to nature time last time.

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,279
So that if there were no Dasein, there'd be no nature time.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:55,279
And Heidegger derived the characteristics of every atemporality from the fact that Dasein is a non-temporal structure, non-successive is a kind of being that has to take a stand on itself, and it has to do it by activity, by coping with things for the sake of some ultimate role that it has.

12
00:00:55,599 --> 00:01:39,000
So we know that date we talked a lot about how datability, significance, publicness, spannedness all derive from that that the fact that not only do we have to take a stand on ourselves in our activities, but these activities have to be coordinated so that they form a sequence in which you get one thing done before the other in the right order and that they have meaning, that they are shared so that they're all in this public same time so that they can be coordinated and be, for instance, simultaneous with each other, and they are stand.

13
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,719
That was all what we talked about last time.

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,840
And that's all required to coordinate our tasks.

15
00:01:47,079 --> 00:02:14,199
Now, the question is, Blattner then says that Heidegger has to derive the sequential order of our practices from the kind of being we are, namely the from, to put it shortly after this, from originary temporality.

16
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:27,400
That's short for being the kind of being that has to take a stand on its being and can only take a stand on its being by activities toward a role of what of.

17
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:54,599
So the question is: can Heidegger actually show that you can get our world-coordinated activity structure somehow, which is certainly a sequential structure, from this non-sequential structure, which is Dasein as the as temporality?

18
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:12,079
Then comes the issue with Blattner, which is always in the background, because he's clearly the best, but he might be, it isn't clearly wrong, but I'm going to try to say at the end, I don't think even Heidegger knows for sure what he wants to say about this issue.

19
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:18,479
But at least we've got to decide whether Lattner's making a convincing case or not.

20
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:33,440
That one, Heidegger wants to be a temporal idealist and claim that not only the intelligibility, but really the structure of all forms of temporality depends on originary.

21
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,039
Can you do that?

22
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,959
Lattner argues that Heidegger can't do it.

23
00:03:38,959 --> 00:04:19,680
And after much discussion with people over this matter, what Heidegger can't do, according to what he has to do if he's going to carry out his idealism, is so that the way our practice has to be ordered sequentially, so that I have to type my lecture before I can come here and read my lecture, and then only then can I go home and relapse and so forth, that this sequential structure itself follows from the kind of being that we are.

24
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,400
It can't be that, as I think it is, and I'll come back to this.

25
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:38,639
I mean, the alternative would be: well, there's some aspect of all this world meaningful activity, which certainly depends on Dasein and wouldn't be there if there weren't any Dasein.

26
00:04:38,639 --> 00:05:13,719
There might be something about nature and nature time that doesn't depend on Dasein and that accounts for the fact that Dasein has to lay out its practices in this sequential order in order to take both sides agree in what I'm saying that you can't make an argument from the originary temporality to the fact that our practices have to be sequentially organized.

27
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:28,039
And Blackner concludes from the fact that you can't make, that Heidegger can't make that argument work, that Heidegger's idealism fails, that being in time fails, that early Heidegger fails, it's a big disaster, all follows from that, according to his book.

28
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:44,920
That the other possibility, my side, is yes, true, you can't get the sequential ordering of our everyday practices out of the notion that we're a being taking a stand on our being by way of those practices.

29
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,639
Then I think that shows Heidegger is a realist, that there's a constraint on how we order our practices.

30
00:05:51,639 --> 00:06:21,080
It comes from something like time, some kind of nature time, some kind of sequencing that is not dependent on us, but which is, together with the way we have to lay out world times, sorry, together with the way we take a stand on ourselves, but together with this constraint from nature, would give us the, say, the sequence of series of nows.

31
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,440
So now that's what I want to argue about.

32
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,560
And that's where Aristotle comes in, which was today's assignment.

33
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:43,839
So if you did what the syllabus said, you read the whole sh section on Aristotle's view of time in basic problems.

34
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,960
Is that what you did do?

35
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,199
I mean, I just want to make sure that we're cor correlated.

36
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,680
No?

37
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,399
Uh-oh.

38
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,199
Oh, yeah.

39
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,919
Oh, yeah, please.

40
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,159
Yes.

41
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,359
I have time out for this important announcement from Tyler.

42
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,440
I just didn't order the book.

43
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
To begin with, big mistake on my part.

44
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,400
So the pages that you but some of you must, if you've been doing the assignment, have bought the book.

45
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:15,199
And I suppose in the back of my mind, I thought if ever there was a book that anybody interested in Heidegger had better buy, it's this.

46
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:31,599
It's the most clear and worked out story of from being in time, but carried further and deeper and in more detail and more clear than the book than being in time and more historical than being in time.

47
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,759
How many have basic problems?

48
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, well, good.

49
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,839
I mean, I get I think that's good.

50
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
I don't feel at all apologetic.

51
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,519
Only that I guess I should apologize for the fact that you might have had trouble getting it.

52
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,759
How many had trouble finding it?

53
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,440
Well, that's interesting.

54
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,319
So where was it?

55
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,679
Tyler, do you understand this?

56
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:56,079
I mean, here are the whole 40 people, really 30 or something, who had no trouble finding it, though we didn't order it.

57
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
How do you explain that?

58
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,240
Really?

59
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,720
I think I would have certainly put it on a list of recommended.

60
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,960
Yeah, but now it's really in effect required because the assignments are in it.

61
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,200
Well, it all ends happily, Tyler.

62
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,759
Except you did a lot of work, it looks like that.

63
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
I really appreciate it.

64
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,759
We've been not turning.

65
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:25,880
If people want, if anybody hasn't got it or knows anybody who wants 50 crucial pages on Aristotle from basic problems, they're in Tyler's mailbox.

66
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,920
Okay.

67
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,320
Now, the role of Aristotle in this is: well, have I said anything controversial yet?

68
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,240
Because I don't want to go into Aristotle if I've already said something that you don't understand or disagree with.

69
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,960
I think I'm just summarizing where we were.

70
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:53,800
Okay, Aristotle on temporality may well be the clue to what to think about this idealism issue.

71
00:08:53,799 --> 00:09:00,360
I would say it was surely the clue, except that I'm not even sure that Heidegger is sure that it is.

72
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,080
But it's certainly an important element.

73
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,359
And to explain this, I have to give credit to where credit is due.

74
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:39,000
I owe a lot to Derek Baker, whose honors thesis three years ago now was on, tried to show that you could at least make a case for Heidegger being a temporal realist century, which we'll explain, based on what he says about Aristotle in these 20 or 25 pages or whatever that we've read for this week.

75
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,000
So now I'm going to talk about the Aristotle.

76
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Aristotle sees, according to Heidegger, that whatever time is, gets to it, depends on us.

77
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:00,680
That we experience time not just as a series of nows, before and after, but as nows ordered, as earlier and later.

78
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:07,919
And earlier and later makes reference to our experience of now and our activity.

79
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
So now I'm going to now take your book.

80
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,560
I just, there are certain passages, which it seems to me anyway, we have to just read carefully and think about.

81
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:33,519
The first is, and this distinction is the basic distinction that he's got in this Aristotle chapter about which everything turns is the distinction between before and after and earlier and later.

82
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:44,960
If you don't sort of hold on to that and get that and see that Aristotle's got it and that Heidegger thinks it's a good thing that Aristotle's got it, you can't understand, I think, what's going on.

83
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,800
So and what's the difference?

84
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,840
Well, earlier and later is always with respect to some now.

85
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,519
It's earlier than what's happening right now and other things will come along later.

86
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,920
Something earlier has already happened.

87
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,679
Something is happening now and something will happen later.

88
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:23,120
And the before and after, we're going to read the passages about that, is a much more general and formal notion, and it doesn't, and it gets defined without bringing in now, or it's intelligible without bringing in a now and an earlier and later.

89
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,799
That's what these quotes I'm now going to be reading you, I think, are saying.

90
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,360
Let's see if this is broken down yet, or whether we're still thankfully recording.

91
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,680
Okay, 242, the middle of the page.

92
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,440
The comparison which, what is that, Eleosis?

93
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,080
I forget.

94
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,519
Somebody tell me.

95
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,240
Bill is it?

96
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,400
Find the Greek.

97
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,960
So when I was reading it, I understood it because I was reading it in context, but I don't know where the context is.

98
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,480
Nobody know Greek.

99
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,680
We don't have to find it in here.

100
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,120
It's a Greek word.

101
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,800
A few lines above.

102
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,240
I don't see it yet.

103
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,360
Tell me where.

104
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,480
I still don't see it.

105
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,800
Ten lines down.

106
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:15,000
Another form of motion, that one, is for example, ah, aiosis, whatever that is now, will become becoming different in the sense now we find out.

107
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,240
It's becoming different in the sense that one quality changes to another.

108
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,480
Like something that was red can gradually turn green.

109
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,960
One particular color to another.

110
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,200
And here too there's an advance away from something towards something.

111
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:36,440
That turns out to be the formal, most general way of thinking about it.

112
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:46,360
And before and after turn out to be a way of thinking about comes under that notion.

113
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:55,560
Now you the obviously the before is it's away from the before and toward the after.

114
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,240
But in but you notice there's nothing about earlier and later.

115
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,920
We still call this structure of motion its dimension.

116
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:11,240
Taking the concept of dimension in a completely formal sense, this is he wants the most general notion, in which spatial character is not essential.

117
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,320
That is, you know, change is more general than change of place.

118
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,200
And he says change of color is equally comes under this notion.

119
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,880
Dimension expresses a general notion of stretch.

120
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:34,320
I haven't looked at the German, but I take it that this stretch is the spannedness of the of the being in time version of this.

121
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,240
Extension, in the sense of spatial dimension, represents a particular modification.

122
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,400
Well, I'm wrong about the spandedness.

123
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,840
I guess we'd have to look.

124
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,080
Nobody's got the basic problems in German in front of them, I imagine.

125
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,880
It shouldn't be spandedness, I guess, because spandedness is a temporal notion, the way Heidegger's using it in Being and Time.

126
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,080
It's one of the temporal features of the world.

127
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,279
And here, it's so general that it isn't temporal at all.

128
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,720
It's much broader.

129
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,319
It's, well, temporal, I guess it could be.

130
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,840
Well, maybe that's the point.

131
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,519
The general notion of stretch.

132
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,440
Let's try this on away from something towards something.

133
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,399
Spandedness.

134
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:26,000
Now, is away from something towards something spandedness, or is spandedness something that has space built into it already?

135
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,360
I don't know.

136
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,360
I'm not saying a big deal depends on it.

137
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:45,519
It would just be nice to have our if certainly the spandedness, but since we don't know what so anyway, there's some kind of stretch, and that is from something toward something.

138
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,880
That's all he needs.

139
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,759
So extension in the sense of spatial dimension then represents a particular modification of stretch.

140
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,080
Now that may be spandedness, that is this particular modification.

141
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:07,040
In the case of the determination of, and there's some more Greek, we could rid ourselves completely of the spatial idea, something that Aristotle did too.

142
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:13,200
A completely formal sense of stretching out is intended from something to something.

143
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:20,679
So Aristotle's got this very general notion in his view of time.

144
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,920
Now next go to 246.

145
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:31,400
There's a whole lot in here that's interesting, but it's all in about four pages that the crucial moves get made.

146
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:45,320
So, and this is all when he starts talking about the Proteron Historon and whether the Proteron Historon in Greek is about the earlier and the later or the before and after.

147
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:53,880
And Aristotle is pretty has a distinction, and Heidegger thinks he doesn't stick to it very well, but it's a very important distinction.

148
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,480
So let's start with the first full paragraph at the middle of 246.

149
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:10,039
In one place, Aristotle says about Proteron Histeron, a bunch of Greek things, it is first of all in place, in change, in sequence of places.

150
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:15,800
He's thinking of before and after here, and still wholly without any time determination.

151
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:22,519
See, Heidegger's getting very careful to try to separate earlier and later from before and after.

152
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,120
Everything hinges on getting that across.

153
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,240
Going on, the Aristotelian definition of time can also be formulated at first in this way.

154
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:36,919
Time is what is counted in connection with motion, which is experienced with respect to before and after.

155
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:42,999
But what is thus counted is later unveiled as a series of nows.

156
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:48,120
The now themselves, however, can be expressed and understood only in the horizon of earlier and later.

157
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,559
So there's all the, there are these two horizons.

158
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:58,679
By the way, I don't know if this is, it always seems hard for me to grasp when it says something like that, understood only in the horizon of.

159
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,360
I think you could just as well substitute in terms of earlier.

160
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:06,880
Is that right?

161
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,840
I don't know that in saying in the horizon of, it's not the fancy horizon that goes with the ecstasies.

162
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:21,360
It's much more just normal use, if there were a normal use of this sort of notion of horizon.

163
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:29,120
In the context of, on the basis of, the best I could do is whatever goes in there.

164
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:41,120
So the before and after, with respect to before and after, and in the horizon of the earlier and later do not coincide, the second is interpretation of the first.

165
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:48,319
Well, that's beginning to look like before and after is more basic.

166
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,719
And you could have a before and after without an earlier and later.

167
00:17:52,719 --> 00:18:01,919
Or you can have it within an interpretation of the before and after, you can bring in an earlier and later.

168
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:07,920
But it's complicated because the nows seem to be sort of, I don't really understand all this.

169
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,159
That's what you're all supposed to help do.

170
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:16,399
The now's seem to be already somehow implicit in the before and after.

171
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:19,360
What this sentence boggles my mind.

172
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,519
But what is thus counted is later unveiled as the nows.

173
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,719
So here you are counting the change from before and after.

174
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:34,719
And you're doing it by, I guess I sort of understand it.

175
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:45,519
Now it's red, now it's greener, now it's even more green, now it's completely green, as it's changing from red to green.

176
00:18:45,520 --> 00:19:00,039
And the way you count it is by selecting stopping points and saying now it's this and then now it's that and now it's that.

177
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:24,520
How can it be that the now is unveiled as if the now was there all along, but the earlier and later is an interpretation, the before and after, and the earlier and later, the now part, that now it's this, and then, well, is it, let's see, so before and after, you're counting before and after.

178
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,399
You won't do it without using nows, I think.

179
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:31,159
And nows have already got, and yeah, it's all puzzling.

180
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:35,799
Certainly the nows have already got an earlier and later character, haven't they?

181
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:43,959
They're earlier than this now and later than now, some things earlier and other later.

182
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:48,279
So what's more basic than you see what's bothering me?

183
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,039
Is there a before and after?

184
00:19:50,040 --> 00:20:00,279
I would have, I just, except for this sentence, that it's unveiled, but what is thus counted as before and after is later unveiled as the nows.

185
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,719
That's what bothers me.

186
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:04,759
Why isn't it, say, interpreted as the now?

187
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,919
I mean, it seems to me everything is tapped into that unveiled.

188
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:11,719
That says, aha, the nows were there all along.

189
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:24,839
And what's been the argument that in order to count the before and after, they don't impose a bunch of, expose a bunch of nows that have been veiled up to then.

190
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,320
Come on, somebody's supposed to help me with this.

191
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,600
That's why you're here.

192
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:33,360
Fairly nothing out of court in my mind.

193
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,399
Well, I'm going on.

194
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:35,840
It may not make any difference.

195
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:37,760
Somebody's got to try, okay.

196
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:54,320
You're very intimidated on the veil, but because always going to voice.

197
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:55,920
Oh, well, that would be good.

198
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,560
I mean, I would be happy to unveil the fore and after.

199
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,439
But it looks like he's saying he was unveiling the nows, doesn't he?

200
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,560
We've got to go back and look.

201
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,479
I mean, if he didn't, that would be true then I wouldn't have any problem.

202
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:10,880
But it's, then I want to say the before and after doesn't have any now's.

203
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,679
It doesn't make any reference to somebody who's in the middle of this counting them.

204
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,080
And you can put in the nows and you can count them that way.

205
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,559
You can count the before and after with now's.

206
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,919
But it didn't once say they were veiled, that is covered up.

207
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:30,639
You seem to me to beg the question.

208
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:39,439
You said that there's this whole Dauseine relative now element has been there all along.

209
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,279
That's just the question.

210
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,639
Well, you see, yeah, Tyler, do you understand my problem?

211
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,759
Never before and after.

212
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,600
That's what it seems to be saying.

213
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,159
And that doesn't, we want it to say that, do we?

214
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,520
Ah, I see.

215
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,040
That's a good step, maybe.

216
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,439
Every before, and I thought, yeah, yeah.

217
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:03,880
Before, there must be a present before which such and such and after which such, and such.

218
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,719
And that present is what we're going to name as the nows.

219
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:15,600
But it's not nows yet, so to speak, but but it's what steps up the possibility of the now.

220
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,320
And so I'm saying it's the veil nows, that's not quite right, but it's close enough, the way you fit it.

221
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:32,999
There is in the just in counting the before and after, the condition for saying now is already involved, something like that.

222
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:33,639
I guess.

223
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:33,960
Yeah.

224
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,199
Yeah, does that make a difference?

225
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:44,840
Because because putting it in terms of our experience, you mean, then the now comes in from us, whereas the before and after doesn't have the nows in it.

226
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,199
That might be a good idea, too.

227
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,759
I mean, maybe we should put you entirely together.

228
00:22:50,760 --> 00:23:05,719
I mean, so we're not counting the in counting before and after, there's already a present in which something is before and something after, and we experience that.

229
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,239
Is that what you think?

230
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:18,039
Okay, motion, yeah, which is experience with respect to before and after.

231
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,439
You can throw this experience in there.

232
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,279
I was going to quote that quote next.

233
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,519
Yes, that makes a big deal.

234
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:49,399
So all this, I mean, I'm saying the nows are unveiled is sort of unfortunate, but if you're getting it, if you're saying in the experience the nows are unveiled, not that through your experience the nows are unveiled in this stuff that would happen whether you were experiencing it or not, but that when you are counting, in your experience of counting, then the nows are already implicit.

235
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,159
They're veiled.

236
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,759
That's how you want to read it.

237
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,319
Definitely.

238
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,159
I don't know, but let's go on.

239
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:02,399
I mean, they're going to be sort of holistic puzzles all along the way, any one of which we can only try to deal with if we look at all the others.

240
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:04,080
So let me look at the others.

241
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,199
Where are we?

242
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:11,279
Uh the n the nows themselves, however, can be expressed and understood only in the horizon of earlier and later.

243
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:22,799
So when you've got this experience of counting, you can only express and understand what you're doing by bringing in earlier and later, it says.

244
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,840
The width respect to before and after in the horizon of the earlier and later do not coincide.

245
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,959
The second is an interpretation of the first in your experience.

246
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:36,080
Okay, that's I'm just reading the quotes that I think we have to take account of.

247
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
That might be it.

248
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,959
No, one more.

249
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,719
It may be the one you just read.

250
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,600
No, I don't think so.

251
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,600
But anyway, the end of the previous paragraph, 1243.

252
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,840
As counted, now we got to the nows.

253
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,719
The now's themselves count.

254
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,600
That's puzzling too.

255
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:59,840
I don't think that's some kind of pun, that as counted, the now nows themselves matter.

256
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:03,039
That isn't what it's about, I'm sure.

257
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,080
As counted, the nows themselves count.

258
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:09,919
When I try to understand that, I think about the clock.

259
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:14,959
That there is, now the hands are here, now the hands are there.

260
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,439
And so we add up the nows.

261
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,760
If anybody has a better view, the nows count the places.

262
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:31,600
So now it's five, now the hand is at five after, now it's at six after, now it's at seven after.

263
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:40,319
So the nows counted by a, now it's here, now it's there, and the now's do the counting.

264
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,679
They count the places.

265
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,519
Now it's at five, now it's at six.

266
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,519
I think that's what he's saying.

267
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,679
They count the places so far as these are traversed as the places of the motion.

268
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:55,800
Time as Aristemos, where what did we find out what that meant?

269
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,000
I think that must be the numbers that's counted, right?

270
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:03,479
Time as number is the counted that counts.

271
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,719
Did I get it right about the counted that counts?

272
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:10,039
Has anybody understood what I said or think they could say something clearer?

273
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,520
Okay.

274
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,519
If you can, always come and jump in and do.

275
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,240
Okay, that uh the counted that counts.

276
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:22,279
Aristotle's interpretation of time matches the phenomenon extremely well.

277
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,080
I think that's I put that quote in here for that.

278
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,880
He's not criticizing Aristotle.

279
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:43,159
He's saying Aristotle has got this, in making this distinction, Aristotle is doing a very good job of explaining both aspects of the way we understand time.

280
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:49,239
If he's criticizing Aristotle at all, it's because he thinks Aristotle hasn't sorted them out too well yet.

281
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:52,199
But I don't think he's criticizing Aristotle at all.

282
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,679
So at least not yet.

283
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,519
Maybe in a minute.

284
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:06,919
So on 247 at the top, primarily protoron historon means for Aristotle before and after in a sequence of places.

285
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,479
It has a non-temporal sense.

286
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:12,759
This is again, notice not earlier and later.

287
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:20,600
But the experience of before and after intrinsically presupposes in a certain way the experience of time, the earlier and later.

288
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,080
Well, we've already gone through that under that now story.

289
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,319
I think that's the same mysterious thing, that there's something implicit presupposed.

290
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:41,520
If you think you're just dealing with a sequence, if insofar as you're counting the sequence, you already have to experience time as earlier and later.

291
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,240
I'm taking over the experience.

292
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,719
Yeah, good.

293
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,840
Tell me things.

294
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:58,159
I think it's clear that I hope it becomes clearer, but I'm convinced that he thinks that before and after is more.

295
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,519
Let me not have any cards up my sleeve.

296
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,840
Everything's going to depend on this for realism-idealism issue.

297
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Because no doubt, there's no earlier and later except when we're around.

298
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,759
I'm assuming that.

299
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:23,279
Because we're putting ourselves at some point in the story and say, like in space, like the here in space depends on us, the now in time depends on us.

300
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:36,800
So but they don't have to bring, we don't bring ourselves in so directly, and I'm maybe not at all, to make sense of the before and after.

301
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:50,639
So I want the before and after to be the realist one and say some kind of dimensional, formalish before and after would be there when we were around or not.

302
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:55,279
But it's only when we're there counting that there's earlier or later.

303
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:06,079
So I want before and after to be basic, and I'm ready now to have to amend that, to say, yeah, but the experience of before and after already has in it that a sense of an earlier and later.

304
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,479
That's what these two mysterious sentences say.

305
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:08,880
Yeah.

306
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:09,999
Yeah.

307
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:14,239
Non-temporal sequence in Pernstein than Martha?

308
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:14,880
Good.

309
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Yes, that's exactly what I think it is.

310
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:30,600
Any any such sequence at this formal level is going to be l can be laid out in terms of a foreign after, finally just a mathematical sequence, before two is before three and uh after one.

311
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,999
There is some kind of before and after.

312
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:42,120
And if you're going to be a realist, you're going to have to think that there's some kind of before and after in nature that would be there whether we were there or not.

313
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,719
And that better not be, that's truly not going to be that things are earlier and later before we're around.

314
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,279
Yeah.

315
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,360
It works because there's a towards and from I see, oh ho.

316
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,080
I was wondering too when Eugene said that.

317
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,319
We we get there is a direction.

318
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,999
You're putting down the signs and you're putting down the signs.

319
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,120
You can't just put them down at random and you can't switch in the middle.

320
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,159
You've got to you're showing away from, I don't know, Terre Haute to Indianapolis where I come from.

321
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,560
You wouldn't it wouldn't work or it would still you it wouldn't.

322
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,840
I see wait allowed so we can agree in times.

323
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,360
That those are sometimes a market sequence of the road.

324
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,560
Oh, it could bring it over to nature.

325
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:35,239
I see that might be a problem, how the road is going from Terre Haute to Indianapolis and not from Indianapolis to Terre Haute, right?

326
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,799
Unless unless you bring in this complicated business about whether time is reversible or not.

327
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,840
I think we probably could be bubbling this phenomenological.

328
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,239
And you come here to diperam what you wanted to say.

329
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:50,120
Well, the before after is in the thing of the language.

330
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,880
Ah, oh, ho.

331
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,919
You can't reconcile it as an understatement.

332
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,319
That's supposed to be what makes it possible.

333
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:04,479
What gets him to the time-free movements of nature is that they would be before and after movements, but not earlier and later.

334
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:06,959
Uh that that would be the idea.

335
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,399
Uh yeah, that's and of course but there's sort of verbal thing.

336
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:20,719
And he does say both the before and after and the earlier and later are something like aspects of time.

337
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:22,799
And Aristotle sees that.

338
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:33,600
And I I think later he's going to when he says time-free movements of nature, he means movements in nature that you would have whether Dasein was around or not.

339
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,840
That's why I'm trying to make sense.

340
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:47,759
We're trying to make sense of what it would be like to have something like that, which which had some kind of order, but not the kind of order that requires us to be put in the order.

341
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,880
I think it's very important to keep thinking about space.

342
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:58,799
I mean, the way the here in in space, the now in time have this characteristic of absolutely depending on us.

343
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:07,919
There's no here out in space, and it's not clear what to do with now in time, but it's certainly not our kind of now.

344
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:23,440
Of course, you can have about space this abstract three-dimensional Cartesian story in which points are have a certain, but they can't be, this is all back to division one.

345
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:32,479
They can't be near or far from each other if that's we're going to make that relative to how it available to us near and far.

346
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:55,959
And uh so there's a lot of stuff in space, Cartesian, sort of non- for existence, a lot of stuff for spatiality, which is existential space, namely it's got a here, it's got places in it, it's got distances in it of a non-measured, of a kind of relative to our efforts.

347
00:32:55,959 --> 00:33:07,719
And so with temporality, you've got some, hopefully, that we can make sense of, abstract form of sequential order.

348
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,040
You've got that whether we're around or not.

349
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,080
Just like Cartesian three-dimensional space, it's easier to imagine it's around whether we're around or not.

350
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,679
But it has no hearing.

351
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:19,560
Okay, you want to say something about this?

352
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,080
You look like you did.

353
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,480
No?

354
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,600
Yeah, I don't know.

355
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,719
I guess you were just your hand.

356
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:26,759
Well, I'm going to drop my motor right back.

357
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:34,760
I was not happy because also there's some jumps from before or after to earlier or later when we get to the picture somehow.

358
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,959
Some experience it differently.

359
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,720
Clarifying this as we find out, but on the basis of what?

360
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,519
Yes, I think it, but the trouble is that's very murky.

361
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,120
Because when I try to think about it, I think it's about the now.

362
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:55,880
I think earlier than now and later than, the way earlier and later work, and we bring in the now.

363
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,559
And the before and after as this, what is it from board?

364
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,679
I forget that formulation.

365
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:05,960
Where is it?

366
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,639
You know what I mean?

367
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,240
I read it earlier.

368
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,360
Oh yeah, that's right.

369
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:13,080
Okay, the from something to something.

370
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,760
That doesn't seem to have to have a now in it.

371
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:46,320
And that's how the trouble is, what haunts me constantly is to try to figure out what in the world the now is when it's not the kind of pragmatic now, which is the earlier and later, where you where it depends on uh how you know, you you get to decide how long the now is and what counts as earlier than this now and later than and whereas in somehow there's not going to be this now related to our projects.

372
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:55,599
Now in the world you remember this, I mean there's so many thi remember the now in world time is uh all he says relative to our projects.

373
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:03,599
Again, that's always comes as a surprise, but it's now we're in this class and now we're in the semester and now we're in the spring and so forth.

374
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,399
And and and now I'm trying to explain this sentence.

375
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,800
It's all relative to what we're up to.

376
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,160
And whatever the now is, it isn't.

377
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,959
Well then what is it, a nanosecond, no nanosecond?

378
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:22,080
I mean I just can't picture what a now is when it's not in the i in some span of activity.

379
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:43,200
That's and that uh that that's just related to how much sense you can make of a before and after uh without I can't make sense of a before and after without a now in nature, and I can't make which would but I think you have to, and I can't make any sense of what l let me put the problem.

380
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:58,640
So it looks like in science anyway, which is supposedly thinking about nature, you've got to bring in some kind of now which isn't a pragmatic kind of now that's, you know, relative to our projects.

381
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,720
But there must be some kind of now because now the universe is, I don't know, 10 billion years old.

382
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,080
And it looks like it started back at the first now.

383
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,999
And what the hell is I have no idea?

384
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,119
I think it's worth it.

385
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,919
If you think about it, I mean, I like to statement now, too.

386
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,039
You know, we're not in space, it doesn't make any difference.

387
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,399
Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

388
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:22,999
That's right, exactly.

389
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:34,039
At this point in the universe, there is at, I think we're trying to get to the same, you know, at this point in time, it's not like this point in time relative to me.

390
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:36,999
It's not like, you know, 1000 BC relative to the.

391
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,399
At this point in time, it's got the same, is it a pragmatic sign of point, or is it a nanosecond kind of point?

392
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,079
The same thing happens with here, of course.

393
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,919
How much is here?

394
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:59,480
Where the GPS has located me, or here in this classroom, or here in the university, it has the same here's the nows that normally are defined in terms of our practices.

395
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:08,840
And the idea of a here that doesn't make any reference to our practices and then a now that doesn't make any reference to our practices is really weird.

396
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,079
But I don't have more to say about it.

397
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,520
If anybody does, yeah.

398
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,680
Would we have to admit that?

399
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,399
Let's see.

400
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:21,880
No, I think that's sort of upside down, but I'll have to think a minute.

401
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:38,840
We would have to admit that Heidegger was a temporal idealist if the now is dependent on us and we couldn't make sense of a nature that didn't have its own intrinsic nows.

402
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:47,800
Then it would follow that there wouldn't be any nature if we wanted to ring because we buy the nows and the nature has to have a now in it.

403
00:37:47,800 --> 00:38:03,199
But I want to say the other way is somehow if you could have a view of nature as such a kind of abstract ordering that didn't make any reference to any of our purposes, that would be an argument for realism if you could make sense of it.

404
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:11,760
That gets us to the time-free movements of nature only, where that means that our kind of temporality doesn't.

405
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:20,320
The movements in nature would still have a before and after, but I think, but they wouldn't connect up with our temporality, which is or the earlier and later.

406
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,639
Yeah, totally.

407
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:36,560
But in the before and after, who was people from now and re-established before and after, we established an urban now will be a different relationship between that now and still.

408
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,519
Ah, you've said that before, but that's always interesting.

409
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,360
That's the sun going by kind of story.

410
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:49,679
Yes, that's what I think too, and I think that's what Heidegger and Aristotle think.

411
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,320
Good, good.

412
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,840
But that's what I think too.

413
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,759
Yes, the whole deal.

414
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,240
Christina, what you're saying, I misunderstood you.

415
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,520
So there ought to be a kind of present at hand now.

416
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,040
That was what it would amount to.

417
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:10,399
Stripped of all of its significance and datability and everything that goes with world time and with earlier and later.

418
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:23,439
And it may have something to do with clocks, you know, that we can get there by counting the movement in such a way as I don't see still how we get there.

419
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,760
There's no now on the clock.

420
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,560
And so we've got the same kind of puzzle to say now it's five after, now it's six after.

421
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,599
I don't know.

422
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,040
But I think that's the earlier or later, or both kinds?

423
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:39,919
Both of them, okay?

424
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,959
I'm not sure whether it's me or Heidegger.

425
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:51,880
I may have p introduced this into the conversation, that I I was assuming that there is no now in nature.

426
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,040
Mostly because there's no here in nature.

427
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,839
But that may just be a false analogy.

428
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:00,840
It's certainly attempting.

429
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:13,559
But so there's y there's just a different kind of now between the world-defined, contextual, pragmatic, some kind of something in nature, which is what?

430
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,039
A different kind of now, a present at hand now.

431
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:16,839
It's all right.

432
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,599
There is change.

433
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:22,999
I like that.

434
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:27,320
I guess I well that's that's that's what I think.

435
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,880
So so good, but then I don't know why you need to bring in a now.

436
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,919
Yeah, you have access to pure things.

437
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:37,560
Why not keep a now for earlier and later?

438
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,079
Well, I got us into that.

439
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,919
I mean, partly because, I don't know, Ariel or somebody got us into this.

440
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:48,760
That uh that which is yes, I I'm I think you're right.

441
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,439
I I led you into this.

442
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:56,439
Uh but I was uh I was just saying how puzzling it is to me what a now in nature would be.

443
00:40:56,439 --> 00:41:03,320
And now I and I think what you're saying is we shouldn't be expecting to find a now in nature.

444
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,559
Good, well that's what I want to say all along.

445
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:08,600
Good, okay.

446
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:25,240
And then uh but but then I said, but but we have to s be able to say somehow now it's X billion years since the Big Bang, as if somehow we knew what we were talking about and as if it was the same sort of clock now on a great big clock that we normally use.

447
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,559
That's why I said clocks seem to have a lot to do with this.

448
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:35,120
Somehow once you get to the clock nows and count them, and it looks like there those are present at hand now.

449
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,279
And it looks like maybe the universe can be treated like a big clock.

450
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,439
I d anyway, let's go on.

451
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:44,959
If this I I'm sorry that this is so hard.

452
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:51,439
And maybe it wouldn't be so hard if I understood it, but I I can only tell you what I can see here.

453
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:54,000
Um okay, on two hundred forty-seven.

454
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:55,600
I think did I read this already?

455
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:06,399
For Aristotle to pay for Aristotle before and after in the sequence of pla let's see, primarily, Proteronhoustrom means for Aristotle before and after in a sequence of places.

456
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,720
It has a non-temporal sense.

457
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:18,640
But the experience of before and after intrinsically presupposes in a certain way, as I just had read that, the experience of time, the earlier and later.

458
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,600
And there the emphasis has got to be on experience.

459
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,560
That's the famous the veil story, only it's not so misleading there.

460
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,719
It's it the presupposes is like the the veil.

461
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:40,800
It's if you're going to have an experience of the before and after, then you've got to already have an experience of the earlier and later.

462
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,160
Isn't that interesting?

463
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,279
The experience.

464
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,600
But in the universe, it looks like the it's the other way around.

465
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:56,239
That the if you're going to have the before and after, you've got to already have sorry, I didn't let's go do it again.

466
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:06,640
In in our experience, it looks like you can't have an experience of the before and after that doesn't presuppose already earlier and later.

467
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:19,560
But in the universe, it looks like, you can have, in fact, going on something which can be described in terms of before and after, but doesn't have any earlier and later.

468
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:23,639
So in experience, maybe the sort of dependence goes one way.

469
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:34,439
And if you're a realist anyway, in the universe, the experience would the phenomenon, phenomenon isn't even right, not in the sense of experience.

470
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:44,439
The what you are talking about would be independent and then get interpreted by God, brought into the world, so to speak.

471
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,200
It seems to think both.

472
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:57,480
I mean, it's not in contradiction to think that in the universe, let's just repeat it, there could be an abstract state of the universe.

473
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,760
We experience them in terms of now and earlier and later and bring them into our world time.

474
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:25,240
You can still say, yeah, but when we experience them, we first most basically have an earlier and later pragmatic experience, and we then, by leaving a lot out and theorizing, get to the universe once.

475
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,119
Let's try that.

476
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:26,999
Let me go on.

477
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,279
Let me see where we are.

478
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,240
I want to read one more thing on 247.

479
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:35,159
With a now back, unfortunately, but I have to read it.

480
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,399
The now, I'm going to start at the end of the top paragraph.

481
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:41,000
The now is the limit for what has gone by and what comes after.

482
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:48,039
That's something like Tyler's earlier version, that there's always going to be this borderline between them.

483
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:48,679
I don't know.

484
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,479
Let's go on.

485
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,360
The now which we count are themselves in time.

486
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,040
They constitute time.

487
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:59,640
The now is a double visage, which Aristotle has that long thing to say about.

488
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,960
Time is held together within itself by the now.

489
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,679
Time's specific continuity is rooted in the now.

490
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:14,320
Conjoint with respect to the now, time is divided, articulated in the no longer now and the earlier, not yet now, the later.

491
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:21,919
It is only with respect to the now that we conceive of the then and at the time, the later and the earlier.

492
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,760
That's all, I was assuming that.

493
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:32,800
We were all assuming that, remember, that in an earlier and later layout, it's always with respect to the now that these are earlier and later.

494
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,360
Okay, I have gotten to the end of that.

495
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,439
So where does Aristotle then get us?

496
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,760
Why have we gone through all this?

497
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,200
Well, it may be that Aristotle is telling us about access.

498
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,639
I would like that.

499
00:45:48,640 --> 00:46:04,319
If Aristotle were telling us that there is some kind of before and after which we get access to by way of earlier and later, that would be interesting.

500
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,760
And I think maybe you're saying this at the bottom of 256.

501
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,640
Aristotle's definition of time is not in any respect a definition in the academic sense.

502
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,560
It characterizes time by defining how what we call time becomes accessible.

503
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:23,679
It is an access.

504
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:31,680
The type of defendum is determined by the manner of soul possible access to it.

505
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:39,680
But the counting perception of motion as motion is at the same time the perception of what is counted as time.

506
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,760
I'm not sure what that's all about.

507
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:48,680
I can see this, that this altest destination is very different than something like a condition of possibility.

508
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:50,760
It's the realistic one.

509
00:46:50,760 --> 00:47:05,320
I mean, if you think that we're talking about the conditions of the possibility of temper of time, of course it's going to all turn out to depend on us and we're in Kant.

510
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,880
But that's not Aristotle.

511
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:21,640
Aristotle is telling us something about the structure of our experience that gives us to something actually happening in the cosmos, I presume.

512
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,079
Let's read the next paragraph.

513
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:28,439
What Aristotle presents as time corresponds to the common pre-scientific understanding of time.

514
00:47:28,439 --> 00:47:34,600
By its own phenomenological content, common time points to an original time, temporality.

515
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,000
Heidegger and Aristotle, everybody can agree on that.

516
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:45,399
This implies, however, that Aristotle's definition of time is only the initial approach to the interpretation of time.

517
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:53,880
Remember, I said I think he agrees with Aristotle, but I think he somehow is not going along all, he doesn't think Aristotle's got it all right yet.

518
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:00,360
The characteristic traits of time, as commonly understood, must become intelligible by way of original time.

519
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,919
So that's what Heidegger contributes, that Aristotle hasn't got.

520
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:10,680
Aristotle just takes for granted the characteristic of world time.

521
00:48:10,999 --> 00:48:27,640
Heidegger says he can explain how world time gets laid out by Dasein, that it, how it depends on originary temporality.

522
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,919
And Aristotle hasn't any clue about that.

523
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:54,320
Well, what I was writing, I don't know where my notes say this, but what I was writing about this was: it looks like what I would want to say, it looks like, is that Heidegger's got it right about world time, which Aristotle doesn't understand, and that Aristotle's got it right about nature time, which Heidegger may or may not understand.

524
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,280
I don't know.

525
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,079
Oh, but there was something behind that that I was trying to get at.

526
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:08,399
Aristotle's got it right about world time, it's a nature time, because he's got it, he can distinguish the before and after from the earlier and later.

527
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:14,079
But all he's got about the earlier and later is world time, period.

528
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,680
Now I remember what I was saying.

529
00:49:16,399 --> 00:49:29,200
Heidegger claims he's got a story about how you can derive or make intelligible world time from Dasein's temporality.

530
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:36,480
And now we're back to, and Blattner says, well, Heidegger wants to do that, and he can't even do that.

531
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:47,360
I mean, he can't really get from our existential temporality to the structure of world time.

532
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:56,480
He can't explain how our that and how.

533
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:14,640
He can't explain that our that he can't explain how sequentiality is required in our world practices from existential temporality.

534
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,439
The only way to understand, I think, now this is me versus Bill.

535
00:50:20,439 --> 00:50:22,279
So Bill says, I'm back to that again.

536
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,000
So Heidegger was trying to do it, and he couldn't do it, and he failed.

537
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:29,559
I grant, Bill, that Heidegger was trying to do it.

538
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,559
This very quote says he's trying to do it.

539
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:37,639
He has that Aristotle hasn't seen how you're going to make all of this intelligible in terms of originary time.

540
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,800
That's what Heidegger was going to do.

541
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,080
I agree with Bill, he fails to do it.

542
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:45,320
But I want to say, of course he fails to do it.

543
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:55,240
There's got to be some natural constraint that requires that our practices be ordered in a certain way, one thing after another.

544
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,320
You can't eat poached egg before you cook it.

545
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,600
That's not something you're going to derive from it.

546
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,159
And all kinds of stuff like that.

547
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:21,399
And the very fact that we're constantly having to take account of the order in which the things happen, that seems to me got something to do with this constraint that's put on us by nature.

548
00:51:21,399 --> 00:51:23,240
Nature, something.

549
00:51:23,399 --> 00:51:25,159
The time-free movements of nature.

550
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,399
Maybe it's very hard to know what it is, and it's very hard to know how it does it.

551
00:51:29,399 --> 00:51:34,840
But I want to say, Heidegger, I want to say Bill is right, Heidegger can't do it.

552
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:45,160
That means that Heidegger's project as an idealist, insofar as he's got that project, doesn't work.

553
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,160
But now I'm going to add a new thing.

554
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,479
It's not obvious that that that Heidegger's got...

555
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,320
Let me go on and do that before.

556
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,079
Well, no I mean I I stop where I am.

557
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:53,559
Go ahead, James.

558
00:51:53,999 --> 00:52:10,800
Against Phil Stein, he's going back to section forty-three, where he says, is what the term idealism says amounts to the understanding but is already that which is transcendental for every entity, then idealism affords the only correct possibility.

559
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:29,199
If so, Aristotle is no less but if idealism signifies tracing back to consciousness, whose full distinguishing features are that it remains and is best characterized negatively as unthing-like, then that idealism is no less naive and than the most grossly hello technicalism.

560
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,439
And there he's I mean, I think he's talking about this more general.

561
00:52:33,439 --> 00:52:40,880
It's not just specifically about time, but it's what I think what you're saying is true, but I think it's it's misleading.

562
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:51,999
In the following way, it sounds like idealism is either a trivial claim that our access to stuff depends on us, isn't that the first one?

563
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:55,119
I mean, that what's well where Aristotle even turns out to be an idealist.

564
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,079
What's the what's the it's a very minimal kind of idealism.

565
00:52:58,479 --> 00:53:07,199
The term idealism says amounts to the understanding that being can never be explained by entities but is already that which is okay well that's not trivial.

566
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,559
I'm glad I asked you to reread it.

567
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,039
No, that's just good basic Heidegger.

568
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:16,880
The disclosing of anything depends on us and that's okay.

569
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:25,919
And it's only idealism if it becomes empirical idealism or psychological idealism where you try to understand it in terms of our mental state.

570
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:41,280
And it's it's it's not just our being, our understand the way that things need become intellig intelligible that depend on us, but this but it's the what what which he's rejecting here is the stronger claim that it it's the strong form of concrete idealism.

571
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,360
It all faces.

572
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:44,399
Yeah, that's that's definitely not.

573
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:59,320
So now let me do before but having had a simpler, even sort of just asking the question, what is there about time and nature, natural time and world time that would still be there if we were around?

574
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:05,160
I mean, not we as mental machinery or psychological take, but if Dasein were around.

575
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:16,840
I mean what what he's trying to figure out or what we are trying, I'm trying to figure out, is what sort of temporality would would go away if there were no Dasein.

576
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:23,800
We know publicness, significance, badness, datability all goes away if there's no Dasein.

577
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:40,840
But the question is, is there any other kind of temporality, and that's this universe kind or natural kind or something, which doesn't go away and in fact is necessary for you to even have the kind of world time you do.

578
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,640
That's the realism version.

579
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,600
But that's just I'm just trying to say that's the what you have to keep in mind.

580
00:54:48,599 --> 00:55:18,680
Heidegger's Heidegger is trying to say, I guess, well, I mean, no, I'm so confused because I'm not, it looks as if Heidegger wants to say, Heidegger, that he is a temporal idealist in that he thinks not only does world time he thinks the world time is totally explainable in terms of Dasein's self and activity.

581
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,919
If that's what Heidegger is trying to do, then I think Bill is right.

582
00:55:24,919 --> 00:55:33,280
He fails to do it because, again, there's a kind of constraint on how to organize our practices, which doesn't come from art.

583
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:42,559
But I'm not sure that Heidegger is trying to, and if he did, if that's what Heidegger is doing, then Heidegger's trying to be a temporal idealist and failing.

584
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,599
I don't guess I'm confused about this thing.

585
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,919
Is Heidegger trying to do that?

586
00:55:52,320 --> 00:56:02,640
To derive without residue the way world time works from some temporality?

587
00:56:03,919 --> 00:56:05,600
You think so, I believe.

588
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,760
Originary and primordial.

589
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,880
Okay, well, how's this?

590
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,120
I mean, that's a fair question.

591
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:26,720
Well, the way I think about it is: well, it's primordial and originality of all the sort of temporality that we experience in the world, namely those four characteristics and what happens when there's some kind of clock and how we measure it by the clock.

592
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,079
He's got a story about how he wants a story.

593
00:56:32,399 --> 00:56:35,439
Let's stay neutral with Bill as to whether it works or not.

594
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:43,919
He wants a story, I agree with you, about how all of that is intelligible on the basis of the being that takes a stand on its being.

595
00:56:43,919 --> 00:56:47,120
That's certainly his project.

596
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:59,199
But without the other half of my oh, yeah, but I don't know whether we have to think that it's that for it to be primordial, it has to be accounting for nature and a constraint on that other thing.

597
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:07,199
Why couldn't it just be primordial of the kind of time that we understand and isn't which we live in and is intelligible to us?

598
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,559
It's based for how it understands that.

599
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,760
Nobody has understood that.

600
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:14,399
Even Aristotle.

601
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:27,640
But do you have to make it so primordial that it gobbles up nature time and all constraints on organizing our practices to make Heidegger's project is that Heidegger's project?

602
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:46,439
Or is it only that he's going to explain all of world time and all derivative, primitive versions of worldhuman thought time, all in terms of either power or in terms of our taking a stand on being you look?

603
00:57:46,439 --> 00:57:48,759
Yes, but that's a different point, isn't it?

604
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,399
One, what is he trying to do?

605
00:57:51,399 --> 00:57:53,480
Well, I think, I see.

606
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:59,160
He's trying to explain all the world time.

607
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,360
That would be what it was to do a primordial, define primordial temporality.

608
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:09,240
And he was therefore now.

609
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:15,560
So, and if he's trying to do it, then he failed.

610
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,519
But now I keep flipping back and forth.

611
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:27,320
And I'm going to read you a passage in a minute where you can see that I think Heidegger flips back and forth, but let me try to tell you this.

612
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:49,399
If he thought that he could explain all forms of time, including natural time, in terms of temporality, he'd be a kind of strong temporal idealist, grounding it all in Dasein.

613
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:53,480
I think Bill thinks that's what he's trying to do.

614
00:58:53,479 --> 00:58:55,000
I want to say no.

615
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:58,679
Well, all he wants is to ground world time in Dasein.

616
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:04,080
But he can't even do that unless he buys into this constraint, which is natural time.

617
00:59:04,399 --> 00:59:22,000
And then he can have his world time, but he can't have and he can still have his kind of primordiality, namely all the aspects of world time, a certain bunch of aspects of world time are all going to be dependent on there being Daseine.

618
00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:32,960
But there's going to be this fundamental, general successiveness that is involved in all this world time that he can't explain.

619
00:59:32,959 --> 00:59:34,960
But what's the bottom line?

620
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:45,599
That therefore he can't be a strong kind of temporal idealist, but he could be a kind of, I don't want to call him an idealist.

621
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:55,280
He's going to be, there's no word for it, a phenomenological analysis of temporality in which he does what he does, stick to the phenomenon.

622
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,880
And he doesn't want to be called either an idealist or a realist.

623
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,040
Jamie is very strong on that.

624
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:08,639
That is, he's not going to claim to be doing metaphysical idealism and get everything out of Dasein.

625
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:23,999
And he isn't going to claim to be doing a kind of metaphysical realism in which he's going to give you, he's coming closer, but to give you a story about what there is that's, yeah, I think he, no, I take it that.

626
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:31,439
He's not going to be doing, if Jimmy and I have been having this discussion for the last semester, I really want to make him a metaphysical realist.

627
01:00:31,439 --> 01:00:40,960
But Jimmy kind of rightly says that Heidegger never is not sure that that's what he is or wants to be.

628
01:00:40,959 --> 01:00:44,439
Using a sentence that I found, it's my this miracle sentence.

629
01:00:44,439 --> 01:00:45,279
Can you quote it?

630
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:50,199
There's a place, I was coming to this, where well, let me get there step by step.

631
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,800
You must know the sentence I mean.

632
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:55,320
Okay, let me, I know how to set up that sentence.

633
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,880
But before we do, somebody else had a hand up.

634
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,439
Yeah.

635
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,000
Well, that's interesting, very interesting.

636
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:02,600
Who knows when you think about it?

637
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:05,880
Yes, he does say that primordial temporality is finite, right?

638
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:13,639
It's got the thrown unto death structure built into temporality.

639
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:24,359
And now, and he says that it's a kind of some deep cover-up and misunderstanding and fleeing to claim that time is infinite.

640
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,399
He doesn't, who thinks that, you wrote about that, didn't you?

641
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:29,479
Okay, and he does hold it.

642
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:36,679
Now, who isn't so weird, I don't think, as to think that he's proved that nature time is finite.

643
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,639
So, what does he think?

644
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,840
What does he think about nature?

645
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:43,479
It's infinite or might be infinite, or I think he better.

646
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,919
You're just helping me set up the fact that there's, when you get to the bottom line, he doesn't know what to think.

647
01:01:48,919 --> 01:01:51,079
That's the amazing, amazing fact.

648
01:01:51,079 --> 01:02:01,479
On 254, you get it first said by about Aristotle, and then you think, well, he's setting it up to answer these seemingly rhetorical questions.

649
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:07,880
But when you wait to see what his answer to these historical questions are, it turns out he says, I don't really know.

650
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,079
But let's get to that.

651
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:12,120
First, the middle of 254.

652
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,519
In the middle of that paragraph where the little number 47 is.

653
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:19,159
Time is what is counted.

654
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,800
If there is no soul, then there is no counting.

655
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,919
Nothing that counts.

656
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:27,799
And if there is nothing that counts, then there is nothing countable and nothing counted.

657
01:02:28,439 --> 01:02:31,240
If there is no soul, then there is no time.

658
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:56,959
Aristotle poses this as a question, and at the same time stresses the other possibility, whether time perhaps is in itself in what it is, just a motion, sorry, is in itself in what it is, just as a motion, I'll have to try again, whether time perhaps is in itself in what it is, just as a motion can also exist without a soul.

659
01:02:56,959 --> 01:03:01,120
I mean, that is, time just is what it is and doesn't depend on us.

660
01:03:01,439 --> 01:03:04,000
Aristotle considers that.

661
01:03:03,999 --> 01:03:05,919
He asks that question.

662
01:03:05,919 --> 01:03:19,280
But he emphasizes that before and after, with the constitutive determinant, with a constitutive determination of time is in motion, and time itself is, what is that word?

663
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,479
What is counted, right?

664
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:22,720
Time itself is what is counted.

665
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,600
The before and after counted.

666
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,519
Aristotle is getting very confused or worried about this.

667
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:32,159
To be counted obviously belongs to the nature of time.

668
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,880
So if there is no counting, there is no time.

669
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,399
Or the converse.

670
01:03:36,399 --> 01:03:38,800
Aristotle doesn't pursue this question any further.

671
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:43,760
He merely touches on it, which leads to the question, how time itself exists.

672
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:52,800
We see by the interpretation of being in time, the time is the embracing of that in which natural events occur, is, as it were, more objective.

673
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:59,519
And on the other hand, we also see that it exists only if the soul exists and so forth.

674
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:01,439
And it looks like he just doesn't.

675
01:04:01,439 --> 01:04:03,279
He's saying, yeah, Aristotle's right.

676
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,800
This is very puzzling.

677
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:11,039
It looks like the time must depend on us because we're the ones who count, and even the notion of counting depends on us.

678
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,040
It's unintelligible by bringing us in.

679
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:23,880
And if if time is what's counted, and it's unintelligible to have counting or countableness without us, then time, all time, depends on us.

680
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:30,600
And yet, he wants to say, well, it looks like maybe the before and after doesn't depend on us.

681
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,399
He doesn't say that Aristotle takes one side or the other.

682
01:04:35,399 --> 01:04:39,399
He says Aristotle just raises these questions.

683
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:43,320
So then you ask yourself, well, which side is Heidegger on finding?

684
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:51,080
Is he a metaphysical realist who says the time, some aspect of time doesn't depend on us?

685
01:04:51,079 --> 01:05:06,599
Or is he a Dasein idealist who says that finally all intelligibility and all temporality, all the intelligibility of temporality and even all the temporality depends on us?

686
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:08,439
That's the idealism one.

687
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:11,719
And can you quote that sentence exactly that's in your thesis?

688
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:16,679
Nigga do I'm something like, I've been trying to figure out, I'll try, do you help me?

689
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:27,480
I've been trying to figure out whether temporality is an ontological metaphysical, has an ontological metaphysical significance.

690
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:34,919
I take that to mean whether it has, whether you could be, whether it makes one a metaphysical idealist or a metaphysical realist.

691
01:05:34,919 --> 01:05:38,760
And then he says, man, I am unable to decide.

692
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:39,880
What year is that?

693
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,639
It's 35 about, isn't it?

694
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:45,960
So it's pretty amazing, 30 maybe.

695
01:05:45,959 --> 01:05:47,320
That after this.

696
01:05:47,320 --> 01:06:06,320
Yeah, so it's amazing that, but sort of gratifying that is we're beating our heads against the wall trying to figure out, one, what Heidegger believes, and two, what's right about this issue of to what what the issue to what extent time depends on us as quad Dasein.

697
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,080
For what aspects of time depend on us quad Dasein and what aspects don't.

698
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:21,840
While we're trying to figure out one what Heidegger thinks about it and what's true about it, it's clear that Heidegger hasn't got settled thought about it.

699
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,159
He doesn't know what's true about it.

700
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:25,439
We don't either.

701
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,039
Tyler, I wish you would help us.

702
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:28,559
You've got more thoughts on this than anybody.

703
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:28,800
Yeah.

704
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:29,760
Take a stand?

705
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,280
Oh, let's look.

706
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,159
Let's, where is it?

707
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,280
Let's read it.

708
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,840
Yeah, there's an italics here about the how.

709
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,639
Oh, way down in the middle of the page in 255.

710
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,200
Okay.

711
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,480
Oh, but we knew that.

712
01:06:44,479 --> 01:06:46,399
Isn't that sort of obvious?

713
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,759
That, I mean, that's fine.

714
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,399
I mean, that's what that's nobody did.

715
01:06:50,399 --> 01:06:52,079
I let me gloss that.

716
01:06:52,079 --> 01:07:03,119
That is, nobody c doubts that world time, that's the phenomenon of time, is interconnected with the concept of world and with the structure of Dasein.

717
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,519
Isn't that just a statement about experience again?

718
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,639
I see, what is that?

719
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,200
Taken in a more original, cool, we see that in fact the phenomenon of time.

720
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:16,719
Well, isn't that, I mean, what what did Aristotle miss?

721
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:48,439
I haven't read the intervening sentences, but given what he says on about on 254, I would have thought that the the phenomenon of time in the more original sense, namely the world time, is or time in a more original sense, what more original than Aristotle saw, because it the the whole intelligibility of the temporal structure of experience in the world is that more original.

722
01:07:48,680 --> 01:08:08,600
That's and that's what's going to be then he's going to go into the whole story about the the clock, but but not just the clocks, but about the structure of significance, datability, spannedness, and publicness, and the story about and all of that is what Aristotle supposedly meant.

723
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:14,279
I don't think that sentence in italics settles the things that shows that Heidegger has discovered.

724
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:27,239
You want to read that, that not only that this more original time is temporality, and moreover, it explains everything.

725
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:55,319
So let me, given that the Dasein exists, is in a world, everything extants, that the Dasein encounters is necessarily intra-worldly, contained by world, but we'll see that in fact the phenomenon of time takes in a more original, taking is interconnected with the concept of world and this was well this is tied up with who was saying yes, this is tied up with the whole notion of world and and disclosure and being.

726
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:11,959
If it weren't for the fact that you can get outside of the world, according to being in time, when you do the big split over, this would be really a strong idealist claim.

727
01:09:11,959 --> 01:09:20,039
But is he going to say that time in a l in an original sense is interconnected with the concept of world?

728
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:20,919
That's true.

729
01:09:20,919 --> 01:09:22,840
I mean, we're not going to get rid of that.

730
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:38,079
Time and the non-successive structure of Dasein, that's the most original sense, is supposed to allow us to deduce the temporal structure of the world.

731
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:42,319
That's what we all think Heidegger is trying to do.

732
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:47,519
Whether, see, I wasn't clear about this before because I have too many things on my mind.

733
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:54,720
And Bill says that's what he's trying to do, and he's trying to do it without, this is something came out of a discussion with Eugene.

734
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:59,519
And that's what he's trying to do, and he's trying to do it for everything, including even nature time.

735
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:07,199
But you could say, well, what he's trying to do is to find this originary sense of time, namely we are time.

736
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,720
He's going to find this temporality.

737
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:16,559
And he's going to show that everything that has to do with the world is tied up with it.

738
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:33,599
And that might seem to be total, except that we know that he thinks that the universe and the world are two different things, and that we can get out of the world into the universe if we do the kind of switchover that pure theory gives us.

739
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:41,359
So we shouldn't conclude from this italics, the strong Bill Blattner idealism, that even nature time is unintelligible.

740
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:43,039
I mean, let me just say one more sentence.

741
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:53,439
If this access story makes sense, if Aristotle is trying to do access theory, and it might even be intelligible.

742
01:10:53,440 --> 01:11:04,479
I mean, why couldn't it be the case that nature time is a kind of pure before and after of some sort, the time-free movements of nature and so forth?

743
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:14,720
Moreover, we can gain access to that by going through the whole of world time and leaving it behind, so to speak.

744
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:23,079
We will we will be able to have access to that kind of whatever kind of pure time physics finally tells us is up there.

745
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:42,359
That's what remember that's what's on page four hundred and fourteen of Being in Time, I think it's four fourteen, where he says the he does the existential derivation of science and he says theory and science allow us to get totally deworlded.

746
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:45,479
That's the language of basic problems.

747
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:52,840
And when we're totally deworlded, then construct a theory, a cosmology, which tells us about the world.

748
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:59,800
If we've been able to do that, it would be access practices, not constitutive practices.

749
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,479
I mean, I'm giving you my reading of Heidegger and and Tyler's.

750
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,800
You you're looking at are you you're agreeing with me on it?

751
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:16,199
Yeah, but he says explicitly in here, by the way, wait just say but I don't want everybody to be confused.

752
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,199
He says there is no nature time.

753
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:22,919
And that's like saying there is no temporality in uh in nature.

754
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:24,520
He doesn't worry much about it.

755
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,079
That's right.

756
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:30,600
He says, well surely nature time, whatever it is, isn't temporality, and that's about that's all he has to show.

757
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:40,359
Like the what what do you mean less present at hand when you when you behind the hammer, when you when the hammer breaks.

758
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:40,999
Yep.

759
01:12:40,999 --> 01:12:41,640
Yep.

760
01:12:41,959 --> 01:12:42,760
Yep.

761
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:43,880
I like that.

762
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,039
Yeah, yeah, we're back to that kind of movement.

763
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,119
I'm happy with that.

764
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:51,239
I'm not pressing him for more.

765
01:12:54,680 --> 01:13:10,639
Yeah, well I mean I wait, what do you say this quote that you probably may or may not remember from way back last semester, that the real the reality depends on us and not the real.

766
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,880
Being depends on us but not being.

767
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,519
Why not movement depends on us?

768
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,959
Uh wait, is that right?

769
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:17,279
I don't know.

770
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:24,880
That's what uh wait yes I was going to say something depends on us, we don't know how to describe it, but movement.

771
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,439
Something constrains us.

772
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,720
We don't know much what to say about it.

773
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,959
But what am I trying to say?

774
01:13:34,959 --> 01:13:35,439
I don't know.

775
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,959
Movement, movement does d doesn't depend.

776
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:43,840
How do you describe what does depend on us when it's it we don't know.

777
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:45,359
That's is that right?

778
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:46,319
But okay.

779
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:59,679
I I like everything you say, except do we have passages which make it clear that he thinks that movement doesn't depend on us, that the before and after kind of movement is right.

780
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:05,279
Well I think that's that's that's what he could think.

781
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:07,919
Maybe that's what he does think.

782
01:14:07,919 --> 01:14:35,680
He never I mean just to add another element in this when I think about Blattner, I always want to say to Plattner, look if you think that Heidegger was trying to just to derive the fact that our ordered in the right way so that the causality and the in the sequentiality of activity is preserved, if Heidegger's trying to show that, he certainly isn't very clear that he's trying to show that, and he certainly hasn't got any argument.

783
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:40,319
Blattner's got one pathetic paragraph where he says Heidegger's trying to show that.

784
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:46,079
And the simplest answer, if you're on my side, is, well, Heidegger wasn't trying to show that.

785
01:14:46,079 --> 01:15:03,239
Heidegger's trying to show how world time depends on us, and it doesn't bother him that spandedness and datability have in them some kind of obsession constraint that don't depend on us.

786
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,279
Why not?

787
01:15:04,279 --> 01:15:05,880
Oh, now Eugene is looking unhappy.

788
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,199
Did I say that?

789
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,239
I misspoke.

790
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:10,039
I didn't want to say that.

791
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:14,599
I want to say world time and I see yes, I misspoke.

792
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:20,279
Yes, spandedness both depends on us and on nature, is what I should have said.

793
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:26,119
There are these things that there wouldn't be any spandedness and there wouldn't be any datability without us.

794
01:15:26,119 --> 01:15:28,039
In that sense, it depends on us.

795
01:15:28,039 --> 01:15:31,479
But I didn't mean depends exclusively on us.

796
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:38,439
I meant that we, so to speak, lay it on to something else, and that something else doesn't depend on us.

797
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,639
That's what I think he thinks, or should think, or whatever.

798
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:44,520
I'd like to say part of the meaning of movie.

799
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,560
Whoa, no, I don't.

800
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,399
That's nice.

801
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,560
That doesn't make it very intelligible.

802
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,039
I mean, it's a funny kind of meaning.

803
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:56,199
It's, yeah, I see why you say that.

804
01:15:56,199 --> 01:16:03,959
But usually, meaning is that in terms of which, or we don't know what terms to even use.

805
01:16:07,959 --> 01:16:23,319
But I am saying it's true that to make our world and our practices, the order or the coordination of our practices intelligible, we've got to bring in nature.

806
01:16:23,319 --> 01:16:25,800
And technically speaking, Eugene is right.

807
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:41,359
When you meaning is always that on the basis of which something or other is understood, and in this case, it would be that on the basis of which constraint on the world is understood.

808
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:50,079
Yeah, I guess I do want to say that, except there's something so usually meaning is the most articulated and the most intelligible and the most unified.

809
01:16:50,079 --> 01:17:04,159
Here, and this is what's giving us all our problems, this, quote, meaning is something that's not our, we can't articulate it, it's even literally unintelligible to us when he talks about it and so forth.

810
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:07,199
So it's a very strange meaning.

811
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,479
You see what I mean?

812
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,959
It does the abstract function of meaning.

813
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:21,599
It's necessary to understand worldhood, but it doesn't have the characteristic of meaning you'd expect, namely, this is like a review.

814
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:32,399
When you give the meaning of care, boy, you give an articulated story which adds to our understanding of care, maps it on temporality, shows why it's at unity.

815
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,840
Big deal.

816
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:44,480
But here, meaning is just a very formal something or other that you have to bring in in order to understand something or other.

817
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:53,760
Well, I'd rather say that it's the meaning and just say that it's a very we we have very little access to that meaning.

818
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,999
We don't, given our way of dealing with things, we can't make it intelligible.

819
01:17:57,999 --> 01:17:59,599
We don't get its unity.

820
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,439
We don't understand what a now would be out there if there was a now.

821
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,079
Yes.

822
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,439
You want to say something?

823
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:07,680
It's true.

824
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,039
You're saying something interesting.

825
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:15,760
I mean, you we tend, you just when you're inside Heidegger to be so inside Heidegger.

826
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,519
I mean the the idea that that he will he doesn't just want to assert that we depend on nature.

827
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,439
I don't think anybody doubts that.

828
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:27,720
He doesn't take Heidegger to come along and say that we've got bodies and that they're of our nature.

829
01:18:27,959 --> 01:18:44,919
He wants to explain what aspects of our experience depend on us being self-interpreting beings and what aspects of our experience, if any, and that's what we're don't depend on us being self-interpreting.

830
01:18:44,919 --> 01:18:51,640
And it isn't illuminating at that level of asking to say, yeah, well, of course we've got bodies.

831
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:56,439
It's like Boswell kicking a stone to refute Hume, it seems to me sort of.

832
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:04,199
I mean, Heidegger's not asking a common sense question and it won't do to give him a common sense answer.

833
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:15,880
Although, I'm not disagreeing with you completely because the fact that bodies have been ruled out of the discussion in being in time does seem a bit like it might have bad effects on the way the argument works.

834
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:19,800
Okay, but you think so?

835
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,399
I don't know.

836
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,199
Maybe, yeah.

837
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,439
Heidegger.

838
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:28,760
Ah, that's what you're leading up to.

839
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,560
Aha.

840
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,880
Temporality is the meaning of care.

841
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,999
The meaning, not part of the meaning of care.

842
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:38,840
It doesn't bother me, but maybe I have to.

843
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,959
No, no, I mean, it doesn't even seem a problem.

844
01:19:41,959 --> 01:19:42,840
I must be missing it.

845
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,999
Let me just say, I mean, temporality is the meaning of care.

846
01:19:46,999 --> 01:19:56,039
Meaning, that that tells us that it explains why it's a threefold structure, what are the threefolds in the structure, how they are unified.

847
01:19:56,039 --> 01:19:57,479
It does all that.

848
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:02,880
But that doesn't mean that there isn't more to be done, that it doesn't do.

849
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:10,399
Is it to be the meaning of something, does that have to say, tells us everything that we need to know about?

850
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,840
Make it exhaustively intelligible or just, okay, makes it possible.

851
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,479
Okay, well, it it is what makes care possible.

852
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,279
But it's funny.

853
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,479
Well, this is all, you know, I hope we haven't lost you all, but I d I think you can follow this.

854
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:34,319
I mean, it's interesting because, yes, it it has to make care intelligible and possible.

855
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:52,959
It's the most basic thing, which is just to say that being is the being that takes a stand on its being, when it's all laid out, explains everything about the care structure and so forth, including the temporality of the care structure and the temporality of the world.

856
01:20:52,959 --> 01:20:55,519
That's all true.

857
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,880
Now, but let's go through this again.

858
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:01,119
Because you said something that struck me, but I don't remember now.

859
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:07,119
I said, but why couldn't that just be a lot of necessary conditions, but not all, but there could be other conditions.

860
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:14,639
And you said, in effect, that it wouldn't count as the meaning of X unless it explained everything there was to understand about X.

861
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,359
Is that right?

862
01:21:15,919 --> 01:21:17,919
That would be the meaning of what?

863
01:21:17,919 --> 01:21:19,599
Everything, us, the world.

864
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:20,880
Okay.

865
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:27,359
Because, well, I'm just not sure how meaning one of the weasliest notions in being in time.

866
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:33,760
Meaning, certainly it has to explain the unity of it and the structure.

867
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:39,119
How that structure makes possible a world.

868
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:44,559
And now comes the does it have to explain also the the structure of the world?

869
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:48,279
I it is is it is it the meaning of it's the meaning of care.

870
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,359
I suppose it's the meaning of the world.

871
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:56,599
I mean, because that's the issue, is whether all these four characteristics of world are being explained.

872
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,480
Could it be the meaning of care and not be the meaning of the world?

873
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:01,399
That's what I'm really committed to.

874
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:08,840
It's telling us about the care everything you need to know about the care component is is if he does it, is in there.

875
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:14,840
And but it's not telling you anything at all about the uh constraint component.

876
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:35,559
But it does that doesn't keep it keep it from making a lot uh but but I see the problem because if it's true that you could only make the world intelligible by bringing in its constraints, which is what you're thinking I'm saying, and I am, then there's a big puzzle because then you I see what you're worried about.

877
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:40,919
Then you haven't really got the meaning of the world because you can't then we're back to the Plattner problem.

878
01:22:40,919 --> 01:22:50,119
You can't explain that meaningful structure of the world, which he, Heidegger, lays out without bringing in the constraint.

879
01:22:50,119 --> 01:23:06,439
And then you either have to go to idealism and say Heidegger's trying to be an idealist and failed, or go to Dreyfusism and say, Heidegger was never trying to, and now you want to tell me, but then he wasn't trying to find, then temporality wouldn't be the meaning of everything.

880
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:12,999
Well, I mean, the only, well, we could, but we'd have to take back the claim that temporality is the meaning, right?

881
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:22,679
Because it can't explain certain aspects of the world, and unless he can explain the whole intelligible structure of the world, he's failed.

882
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,079
That's big, Bill's big insight.

883
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:30,279
And so I want to say, I mean, he'm just trying to get used to what you're saying.

884
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:34,239
Every time you say it, it always strikes me as right, and then I worry about it, lose it again.

885
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:37,840
So I keep wanting to say, yeah, let's fix Heidegger.

886
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:40,479
Let's just put in the constraint.

887
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:44,079
But then Eugene is saying, yeah, but you have to do a lot more than that.

888
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:49,599
You have to put in the whole claim that temporality i explains everything.

889
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:54,159
It's where the explanation bucks stop according to being in time.

890
01:23:54,159 --> 01:24:02,880
And if and that's where I end up just saying being in time is wrong in a way that is just like Bill Blattner.

891
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:11,279
That's a funny thing to find myself on the same side as Bill, except, yes, I can't say Heidegger is a realist.

892
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,599
I should say he could have been.

893
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:17,439
How come he is unsure, I wonder, what to say?

894
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,760
I guess he's unsure about whether temporality is the meaning of everything.

895
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:29,119
That is, whether it can be given a metaphysical, ontological basis where it explains even the galaxies and so forth.

896
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,159
Yeah.

897
01:24:30,959 --> 01:24:33,599
And, okay.

898
01:24:33,919 --> 01:24:55,359
So the bottom line is Bill and I end up, to my surprise, agreeing that Heidegger's project is idealism, namely to explain all intelligible aspects of us and the world and nature too in terms of temporality.

899
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:58,639
That's the big deal claim.

900
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,720
And he can't do it.

901
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,880
And has Bill put his finger on where he doesn't do, how he can't do it?

902
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,640
That surprises me.

903
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,720
You think the one part of it, yeah?

904
01:25:10,959 --> 01:25:19,399
The part of it, he's put his finger on the part that you can't account for why the practices have to be sequentially ordered just out of temporality.

905
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:22,999
The part of it that he hasn't explained, well, it's the same thing.

906
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:29,319
He has, no, no, maybe there's nothing that's I mean, he should have explained that and he didn't explain that.

907
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:30,600
That's all I need to say.

908
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,560
And Bill, is that right?

909
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,640
You look like Yeah, well, that's right.

910
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,559
Well, explaining that's the same, I stopped because it seemed to be the same thing.

911
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:42,359
That is, he needs to explain why our practices have to be successive.

912
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:46,599
And to do that, he needs both us and nature.

913
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,119
And he doesn't want it that way.

914
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:51,560
He wants temporality, namely us, to be the basis of everything.

915
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,679
Is that that's what we're that's what Blattner is saying.

916
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,319
And I think he's right, that's what Heidegger is doing.

917
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:00,840
And then Blattner and I are saying, well, Heidegger didn't succeed.

918
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:01,559
I see.

919
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:07,640
And then Bill isn't saying anything about, and that's because there is something real out there that's a constraint he has.

920
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,319
And I'm saying there's more to the problem.

921
01:26:09,319 --> 01:26:09,800
Yeah.

922
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,439
That's right.

923
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,079
Exactly.

924
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:11,479
Yes.

925
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:11,640
Yeah.

926
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:19,319
And Blattner is right that given Heidegger's ambition, it fails.

927
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:22,840
And I'm sort of happy with what I want to say.

928
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:37,559
Well, let's give up Heidegger's ambition and say this is a brilliant hermeneutic phenomenological existential account of the structure of all of our experience, provided you don't claim that it's all depends on temporality.

929
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,199
Okay.

930
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:39,639
Yeah.

931
01:26:39,959 --> 01:26:40,359
Yeah.

932
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:46,439
But that was more the semi-evolved on a basis.

933
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,039
You would agree that there's a name, something in a real innate way.

934
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:50,680
Yeah, good.

935
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,640
Yeah, that's a point.

936
01:26:51,640 --> 01:27:00,520
I mean, are you saying that's a problem and why doesn't he I mean, it's such an obvious problem and maybe the body is sort of you put it in under the guise of the hammer.

937
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,880
It comes to the same thing.

938
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:11,119
Because there's stuff out there which is so obviously the causal basis of what's going on and of course he's not accounting for that.

939
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:17,279
Why is any issue about what it's just an issue about sort of what it is to have the meaning of something and do the job?

940
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:23,760
Now we have to see if Eugene can help because uh well okay first you you haven't had anything to say recently.

941
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,239
Go ahead.

942
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:33,680
Well I I haven't had anything to say very much because I teach from the moment saying this last week, even though I feel particularly prepared to speak you, I feel complainted.

943
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:46,480
I mean if we let this go, and we let go of the sort of vile idea that temporality is the meaning of care, and we reduce Heiger to idealism well we reduce him and refute him.

944
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:57,520
So I feel as though we lose sight of what I at least thought was the most interesting of our style and ethics, and that ground is important towards understanding Dahlia.

945
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:01,199
Dahlphan's interference derived with the world.

946
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:08,880
And that one cannot deworld Dahl, keep defining grounding for Dahlpha and how positive, and thereby understand construction.

947
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:11,519
Deworlding is done on the background of the world.

948
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,840
It's not like anxiety, if that's any help.

949
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:29,119
I mean, all these scientific practices in the laboratory and all very significant and meaningful and everything, but you get access to entities whose anstructor doesn't have any relation to these objects.

950
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:41,199
That's that's the kind of realism I'm thinking he has to have if he's going to claim that deworlding gets us sort of science, if he wants to be if he wants to be a realist about it.

951
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:46,559
I think there's some people who are asking about how do we have to access these things.

952
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:51,159
And I wonder if then did being in time really have any point?

953
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:55,800
Did we end up willingly start trying to figure out how we're still asking that question at the end of the day?

954
01:28:55,959 --> 01:28:57,800
Well, that that that's not quite fair.

955
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:05,239
I mean uh it's not epistemology because it's not about how minds and subjects get uh access to mind.

956
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,479
Maybe it is mind-independent objects.

957
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,519
I see what you mean.

958
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,199
Okay, touche.

959
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:11,479
Let me think a minute.

960
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:25,399
Uh I think the answer is something like uh it is epistemology, but it's okay epistemology because we're not asking about how the mind and and gets access to chairs.

961
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:31,559
I mean that's that was good old-fashioned Cartesian epistemology, how we could our inner representations.

962
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,439
And now we've got a very precise question.

963
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:37,319
How does how do we account for science?

964
01:29:37,319 --> 01:29:43,880
How do our practices get us access to the kind of entities that are science studies?

965
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,319
That's not epistemology.

966
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:48,199
I don't know what that is, scientific methodology failure or something.

967
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:49,640
Epistemology is gone.

968
01:29:49,640 --> 01:30:06,039
I mean that's you can't have I think epistemology depends on believing that it's all the inner content of subjects in Uberhau have to somehow get get in touch with the outer stuff and we're not going to talk about that anymore.

969
01:30:06,039 --> 01:30:08,279
So let's put that aside anyway for the moment.

970
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:11,800
I want to follow up by his what's your first name I forget.

971
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,359
You.

972
01:30:12,359 --> 01:30:12,680
Yeah.

973
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:14,599
Alex question.

974
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:15,079
Okay.

975
01:30:15,079 --> 01:30:16,519
I think that's fascinating.

976
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:19,239
I mean and I have to we have to think about it a little bit.

977
01:30:19,239 --> 01:30:28,119
Thorley Heidegger, when he says that temporality is the meaning of care, is also fully aware.

978
01:30:28,119 --> 01:30:45,359
And if you ask him, but aren't there hammers with causal properties, m metal blobs and stuff, underlying the ready-to-hand, and that present at hand was there all along and somehow is a constraint for sure on the capacities of the equipment.

979
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,559
What would he say?

980
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,720
I mean, I just want to get the terminology straight.

981
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,800
He would have to say that isn't a question of the meaning of anything.

982
01:30:52,800 --> 01:31:07,279
That's just some kind of fact about the world, that there are these things, the th the the stuff remember reality depends on us, but the real doesn't for Heidegger.

983
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:10,159
Being depends on us, but beings don't.

984
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:19,519
So the the beings of the ready-to-hand hammers, the causal properties of stuff, doesn't depend on us.

985
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:27,119
And it isn't the job of a uh fundamental ontology, I guess is the name of it.

986
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:38,559
It isn't the job of his fundamental ontology to explain that there is this stuff and how we get access to this stuff.

987
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,999
That's is that right?

988
01:31:39,999 --> 01:31:42,800
I mean, uh i otherwise he you go ahead.

989
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,399
This is an interesting question anyway.

990
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,439
The interpretation of of fact.

991
01:31:48,959 --> 01:31:58,319
So be by saying the question that is not Now I think I think that's wrong what you're saying, but if let me say it back to you and see if I've understood you.

992
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:09,519
You don't he you can't go and say uh somehow you there's a kind there are some kinds of interpretation which fall outside of fundamental ontology.

993
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:15,279
I think all interpretation is part of what he's interested in.

994
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:24,519
But there are some facts like yeah, is that what you're saying, like like metal is uh doesn't break uh the way ice does.

995
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:30,439
Those kind of facts are not interpretations and are not part of fundamental ontology.

996
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:38,999
And you can he can be a realist about them in in a way that he can't be a realist about uh time.

997
01:32:38,999 --> 01:33:01,079
And that's because of with all this discussion with Eugene, that to be a realist about time is part of the project of fundamental ontology, or sorry, getting getting the right story, realist or not, idealist, whatever, getting the getting seeing the time as the ultimate horizon for making everything intelligible, that he's got to do.

998
01:33:01,079 --> 01:33:06,599
But that he's got to account for every fact and its causal properties.

999
01:33:07,239 --> 01:33:09,079
That's something he doesn't have to do.

1000
01:33:09,079 --> 01:33:21,800
So it isn't as if, Heidegger, how could you in Division I know that there were bodies and hammers and not give up your fundamental ontology before you ever even got to Division II?

1001
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,199
That's because there's a di it's a different question.

1002
01:33:26,999 --> 01:33:32,119
He never told you, never goes into what's why.

1003
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,239
Now, now back to that just a second.

1004
01:33:35,239 --> 01:33:39,880
Oh, yes, motion that's losing track of too many things to keep track of.

1005
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:50,599
Now, we already said earlier that the motion, in this Aristotle's story, is something about the uh before and after.

1006
01:33:50,600 --> 01:34:10,079
We've got to derive the before and after or somehow bring them into the temporal order, claim that they only are intelligible if you relate them to the earlier and later, and lo and behold, if you're actually counting them, you're implicitly already relating to the early and later.

1007
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:13,760
All the stuff I was complaining about now turns out to be on the other side.

1008
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:21,199
You ca you can't leave these un uh uh untaken over into the world aspects of time.

1009
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:25,760
How he that would be part of his project if Bill is right.

1010
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:37,039
You're going to have to he's going to have to explain, and he does try to explain, how all aspects of temporality are finally back to Dasein.

1011
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:40,639
He does think he does.

1012
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,679
Why is that?

1013
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:47,999
He thinks that in order to order the practices, we've got to use clocks.

1014
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:51,279
We bring them into the story too.

1015
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:54,239
Yeah, but it's so oh well, it's hard to think about this.

1016
01:34:54,239 --> 01:35:05,279
But the motion of the clock seems always the nature is seeming to be rolling around on the periphery or the motion of the sun, and this is Tyler's interest.

1017
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:08,800
So what well now let's turn it over to Eugene for a second.

1018
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,039
I mean, how does the fa uh how is he supposed to handle motion?

1019
01:35:13,039 --> 01:35:21,519
If he's doing fundamental ontology and wants to say the temporality is the meaning of everything, which is, I take it, w everything, what?

1020
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:33,359
Everything, period, for the time being, everything about Dasein and world, what's he going what's he supposed to be saying about the kind of motion that you measure with clocks?

1021
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:36,399
That's is that is that what?

1022
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:37,840
He's going to have a hard time.

1023
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,159
Okay, well, that was a quick answer.

1024
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:41,999
Uh, this is I see that.

1025
01:35:41,999 --> 01:35:43,840
Poor guy, he's had a very hard time.

1026
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,880
Wait, uh, first, wa w war, what's your name?

1027
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,199
Devin.

1028
01:35:48,199 --> 01:35:48,600
I'm sorry.

1029
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,959
I keep always mixing you up as somebody else.

1030
01:35:49,959 --> 01:35:51,239
Anyway, Devin, your hand is up.

1031
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:56,439
Well, the actors in the realist both seems to end up.

1032
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,119
I believe you've written boarding this.

1033
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,880
The practices of science have.

1034
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,640
That's the magic page, right?

1035
01:36:11,319 --> 01:36:12,359
Yes, yes, wait, stop.

1036
01:36:12,359 --> 01:36:12,919
That's right.

1037
01:36:12,919 --> 01:36:20,199
If I were teaching this, and I swear I must have said it last semester, that's already on a stage later.

1038
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:25,720
First you de-world, then you re-contextualize in a theory.

1039
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:31,399
And you've got this view that you don't just de-world and then there are electrons out there in galaxies.

1040
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:40,359
You de-world and then you take what you find when you de-world and you find it, you treat it as evidence for a theory, and then all the facts are theory-laden.

1041
01:36:40,359 --> 01:36:43,880
He's a good sort of Quinian on that one.

1042
01:36:44,919 --> 01:36:54,680
He thinks that even when you get outside and describe these electrons as their essential properties, I'm reading, this is now Dreidiger.

1043
01:36:55,239 --> 01:37:01,399
But anyway, when you get out there and describe those things, you describe them always in a theory and there are no bare facts.

1044
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:02,760
Yeah, yeah, right.

1045
01:37:02,999 --> 01:37:17,880
Well, we've escaped interpretation in the scientific present at hand, and that's why he says, remember, that science shows us what the intelligible, I'm sorry, is science explains the unintelligible.

1046
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:21,159
That is, and that's exactly why there is no interpretation.

1047
01:37:21,159 --> 01:37:26,519
Understanding, he's making this contrast, which is common and done in Germany at the time.

1048
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:36,880
The understanding, which is in the social sciences and the human sciences, makes society and people and anthropology and history intelligible.

1049
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:40,559
Natural science makes them unintelligible.

1050
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:45,279
It breaks it away from all human meaning and all interpretation.

1051
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:53,519
Well, interpretation means drawing out the implicit meaning of this activity that we're in and so forth.

1052
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,560
But I don't want to go back.

1053
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,319
Debbie, we can do it in office hours.

1054
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:01,599
I mean, this is going to be a tremendous relapse if we go back into this.

1055
01:38:01,919 --> 01:38:03,039
Somebody had a hand up.

1056
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:03,279
You.

1057
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:05,520
Movements are present at hand, too.

1058
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:16,479
All that present at hand means is not tied into the referential totality of equipment, but as it being a substance with properties.

1059
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:21,119
So mostly it's like hammers and metal and not even hammers.

1060
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:23,919
Iron and stuff are present at hand.

1061
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:31,679
Something like the pure present at hand, which is more extreme than substances with properties, is what you get when you deworld.

1062
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:44,239
And most of them is going to turn out to be purely present at hand, that it doesn't connect up with our purposes and for the sake of.

1063
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,279
Okay.

1064
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,439
Well, geez, precisely.

1065
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,480
There's still time.

1066
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,199
Yeah, time.

1067
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:54,959
Well, let's see if we're taping it anyway, so I get nervous when I, because I think this is interesting stuff.

1068
01:38:54,959 --> 01:38:56,959
I'm just curious, is it really working?

1069
01:38:56,959 --> 01:38:57,840
Yeah, it's working.

1070
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,399
Go ahead.

1071
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:05,199
Is that why?

1072
01:39:05,919 --> 01:39:08,560
That seems like too small a problem.

1073
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:09,119
Is that what you're saying?

1074
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:14,239
If you don't believe that, you.

1075
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,880
By now, I'm beginning to see.

1076
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:07,720
Well, it's you are what you really are doing is disagreeing with Plattner on death, uh which I think is a good place to disagree.

1077
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,720
He's got weird views about Heidegger on death.

1078
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:17,720
Okay, let me repeat this because nobody's going to hear this on the podcast and wonder well how we got into this.

1079
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:33,959
Uh so uh Tyner is claiming that Bill's c form of non-sequential uh structure, which is a Bill, he makes a big deal about primordial time isn't sequential.

1080
01:40:33,959 --> 01:40:41,880
And there it's got to be right, because Heidegger keeps saying that too, but you're saying the the way Bill reads it is not the right way to read it.

1081
01:40:41,880 --> 01:41:01,279
That to say that it's not sequential is to say that it's finite and its death is somehow permeates all of its uh uh activity, just like it's thrownness and guilt permeates all of its activity, and they are all uh in all the temporal dimensions.

1082
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:08,479
And that's the thing in which even authentic Dasein is not sequential.

1083
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,959
And primordial Dasein is just another name for authentic, it looks like.

1084
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:14,959
The experience.

1085
01:41:14,959 --> 01:41:18,559
Funny, you're doing, I used to do this myself at some stage.

1086
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,239
You're doing a kind of authentic.

1087
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:37,359
When Heidegger says for a primordial, when he says temporality is primordial and authentic, so Bill is saying it's a structure, and it's a structure in which each element of the structure refers to all the others, and there is no sequential.

1088
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:45,519
You're really saying authentic temporality is an experience or is a way of being, and that's not sequential either.

1089
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:56,639
And Heidegger seems to be thinking somehow both, that authentic temporality is the way you live if you've got this kind of structural structure.

1090
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:02,639
And you're not disagreeing, you're just coming in one stage later, I think he would say.

1091
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:12,399
But the question would be whether you could get any more out of what you've been saying than he gets out of his primordial structure story.

1092
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:16,319
How are you going to explain why the practices have to be sequentially ordered?

1093
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,559
Yeah.

1094
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:26,159
Which one are you arguing for now, that the sequence is built right into the authentic way of living?

1095
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:30,239
You know, I think sequentiality is built into authentic and inauthentic.

1096
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:37,359
Well, I I just don't know what to say about that.

1097
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:41,999
I mean, I would are there quotes from Heidegger that suggest that that's what he thinks?

1098
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,599
It's not the kind of quote I would notice.

1099
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:47,640
Of being in time.

1100
01:42:47,959 --> 01:42:48,760
Oh yeah, yeah?

1101
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,119
I remember that passage now.

1102
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:53,640
And that is a strong argument.

1103
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:56,919
That's where he that's the fin and the finite is part of that too.

1104
01:42:56,919 --> 01:42:57,560
It's finite.

1105
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:02,439
Where are you going to get that if you don't bring in your way of understanding death?

1106
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,039
Uh yes.

1107
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:10,439
A kind of sequentiality finite time.

1108
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:17,720
I thought there was you don't agree with Will that that that primordial temporality is non-successive, non-sequential?

1109
01:43:18,039 --> 01:43:21,720
You, but in the experiential way, not in the bill way, not in a structural way.

1110
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:29,400
So you all not think that weird movement on the basis of obese actual speeches.

1111
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:34,519
And Heidegger does see you're on your side, a side which I don't want to be on.

1112
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:46,600
Heidegger talks about every once in a while our allotted time, or a few times he talks about that, as if there really was this sort of sequence of of I don't know, moments or something, and we've got a certain number of them.

1113
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:49,159
Is that followed too with the with the body story?

1114
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:53,239
Something like human beings trying to object to that.

1115
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,760
Does he have a story about that?

1116
01:43:57,159 --> 01:44:00,999
He says talk louder so either I can repeat it or they can hear it.

1117
01:44:04,999 --> 01:44:06,760
Why does that say anything like that?

1118
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:12,760
Does he ask that?

1119
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:20,119
I remember he says we've m I always been struck in the last paragraph he says we haven't said a thing about consciousness in this whole 400 pages.

1120
01:44:20,119 --> 01:44:22,519
We ought to mention it and do something about it.

1121
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:26,119
I thought that was pretty funny, but uh uh and nice.

1122
01:44:26,119 --> 01:44:28,919
But I don't know about this thing about what you're saying.

1123
01:44:28,999 --> 01:44:33,599
Can't just I mean we we we going back into this other place we can sink into.

1124
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,640
You don't distinguish deaths from demise.

1125
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,159
I can't understand how you do.

1126
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:42,399
I mean, it's some event in the future which is going to happen someday.

1127
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:43,600
It's not an event.

1128
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:48,159
Well, just because you're not going to be conscious when it happens, that doesn't seem very important.

1129
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:55,520
It's an event in the future which is coextensive with an event in which Dasein loses consciousness, is what you're thinking.

1130
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:59,039
I mean, you can't, that is a not very what?

1131
01:44:59,359 --> 01:44:59,919
What's that?

1132
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:09,599
Yeah, there's no there's an event in the future of sequential time at which Dasein will no longer be.

1133
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:14,640
And that's not demise because Dasein isn't around to experience it.

1134
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:20,720
But it's still, you, it's putting your death off into the future in a way which Heidegger, I thought, considered inauthentic.

1135
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:25,600
Well, it isn't going to happen now, that event coextensive with the moment when I'm not going to be, but it's going to happen.

1136
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,359
So that's why I don't buy a death.

1137
01:45:27,359 --> 01:45:29,039
But we could we couldn't go back over it.

1138
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:32,800
I mean, but anybody who's writing a paper on it should find it interesting.

1139
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:40,159
Because let's just repeat, because for him, primordial temporality is a structure.

1140
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:45,519
The structure is all the elements are in no way s lined up successively.

1141
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:45,840
Right.

1142
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:46,880
Yes.

1143
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,880
When Heidegger drives.

1144
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,359
You could have it using your own argument.

1145
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:52,079
You can't have it.

1146
01:45:53,279 --> 01:46:05,680
Well, I my argument I just sort of gave, because you if you've got to do it in terms of the ultimate structure of Dasein, which is throwing falling, projectines, as he keeps saying.

1147
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,399
He doesn't say getting born and dying.

1148
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,760
That's too ontic.

1149
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:10,880
That's too temporal.

1150
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,559
You get born at a certain moment.

1151
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,999
And you may not mean there around when you die, but you're certainly sort of there when you're born.

1152
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:21,880
Or maybe you're not, but it's there's a moment coextensive with whether you're there or not when you're born.

1153
01:46:23,159 --> 01:46:37,079
And this is and he thinks, and I agree with him, that's not capturing throwing and falling projecting at this abstract structural level that he thinks Heidegger wants to do it.

1154
01:46:37,079 --> 01:46:40,359
But all these are all sort of amazing unsettled issues.

1155
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:47,399
I think everybody's looking pretty exhausted and we've covered all the obsessions and all and and new material too.

1156
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,159
So I think we should stop.

1157
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:54,119
But and notice, I'll make a little fi final oration.

1158
01:46:55,239 --> 01:46:58,679
I have a little thing and maybe I would I wonder if we covered this later.

1159
01:46:59,239 --> 01:47:01,319
If not I can bring with it next bring it next time.

1160
01:47:01,319 --> 01:47:08,840
But I want to say this, that remember now we're going to leave all this murky stuff behind, though it's a good thing we spent a long time on it today.

1161
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:14,439
We're going to the pure ontology, which is probably very hard and abstract in a new way.

1162
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:28,919
For next time we're going to talk about temporalitate, this higher order form of some temporal something or other, which is supposed to explain the unity of all these no kinds of temporal something or others that we've ta talked about.

1163
01:47:28,919 --> 01:47:30,520
That's the ast that's right, isn't it?

1164
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,279
The next kind is temporalitate.

1165
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:33,720
Okay, so prepare yourself.

1166
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:37,720
Don't expect this somehow that to go right on from where we are.

1167
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:41,239
It's a kind of radical different issue from where we are.
