1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,161
At the very end, without ever warning us at all, that this thrownness was which has been around is now comes out to be birth and lo and behold it's a it's the other end of the hole.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,720
It looked like we only plugged up one end of the hole.

3
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:18,881
Why bother to plug up one end of the hole if you can't plug it all up?

4
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:27,921
And so I want to say he should have done the death thrownness plugging up of the hole as well as the death part, or not at all.

5
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:28,880
I mean, I'm never sure.

6
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:36,240
I don't understand, and I we had a long discussion in my office just what this hole is and why it's important and what gives it to us anyway.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,401
If anybody knows, please come and tell me in office hours next Wednesday.

8
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:41,361
I certainly don't.

9
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:44,560
But let's read the rest of this at the top of 425.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,560
The other end, however, but death is only the end of Dasein.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,840
There's just one of the ends.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,560
The other end, however, is the beginning, the birth.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,880
Only that entity which is between birth and death presents the whole, which we have been seeking.

14
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:01,200
Well, so we just didn't get the whole.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,400
And not only didn't we get it, but we didn't get it through all of Division II and it didn't seem to make any difference.

16
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:13,520
We did all the the hermeneutical phenomenological work without it and now tacked on at the end we're going to get it.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,960
That is just crazy.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,560
The Tyler, can you help?

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,840
That's right.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,760
He doesn't do the beginning.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,480
No?

22
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:25,441
And he does.

23
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:26,560
That's right.

24
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:33,041
And there's no reason why you should have the two ends plugged nailed down into a hole just to d to do the stretch part.

25
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:33,761
It's stretchy.

26
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:37,760
It stretches all along, like elastic.

27
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,840
So I don't know what he's doing.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,000
And there's something you said made me think, oh yeah.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,360
And throwingness doesn't play much of a role in this chapter.

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,360
It's mostly about anticipation and choosing possibilities, then projecting.

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,041
And then all of a sudden at the end, I was going to save this remark till the end, but it is so strange that I'll read it right now.

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:27,720
On 438, I mean, we have to go to get the full shock, you have to go through all the talk of projecting on possibilities that the chapter is mostly about, until you all of a sudden come to the bottom of 438, which says from the phenomena handed down and repeating, which are rooted in the future, it has become plain why the historicizing of authentic history lies predominantly in having been.

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:43,480
So suddenly the historicizing of ontic history, which has all been future-oriented, over and over he said that in the chapter, turns out now to give us the seemingly the priority of having been.

34
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:53,801
I'll just read more, but it remains all the more enigmatic in what way this historicizing as fate is to constitute the whole interconnected of Dasein from birth to death.

35
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,401
How can recourse to resoluteness?

36
00:02:55,401 --> 00:03:00,921
You see, now we're back in guilt and resoluteness, bring us any enlightenment?

37
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:05,000
Is not each resolution just one more single experience and so forth?

38
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,481
Is the connectedness of authentic historicizing to consist, let us say, in an uninterrupted sequence of resolutions?

39
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:17,080
The answer is, of course not.

40
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:26,760
But how come all of a sudden it turns out having been is prior in some interesting sense?

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:40,200
Now what I will try to convince you of, if I could keep track of all this, is that indeed the past is prior and in a certain way more important than the future.

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,521
And it's just odd that 99% of the time he prioritizes the future for reasons I've never fully understood.

43
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,121
And it looks like there he prioritizes the thrownness.

44
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:58,160
And the truth is they're totally correlative and what's his word always?

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,480
Equiprimordial and so forth.

46
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:06,960
I mean, you can't make any sense out of the thrownness except to take them up as possibilities.

47
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:08,801
That's what he keeps saying.

48
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:14,320
But you ought to equally well say, again, this is trying to give you the background of what I'm going to talk about all today.

49
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:23,600
You ought to equally well say there's something about the thrownness that determines what possibilities you're going to take up.

50
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:35,281
That is, what wasn't clear and what I want to try to talk about right now is I'm just seeing if I missed something.

51
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:47,600
No, okay, so what I want to take up is the sense in which there is something positive about the thrownness and the guilt.

52
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:52,880
Put it this way, I've been talking and saying we can't get behind our thrownness.

53
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,760
That's true.

54
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,041
We're finite.

55
00:04:55,041 --> 00:05:00,000
We never can understand fully what our view on the world.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,720
It's too pervasive and it's always already there and so forth.

57
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:18,161
But I couldn't give any sense to, well, what's the positive value of this sort of inchoate, heavy thrownness, which is on the basis of which we act?

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,280
What is it?

59
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:29,720
Well, I think, though he never says it, he ought to say that it's the mattering, that mattering determines which possibilities we're going to project on.

60
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:39,560
So you've got to have equally possibilities and mood or mattering, something that makes the possibilities matter so that we project on them.

61
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,721
And he doesn't, he never spells it out, but I'm ready to spell it out.

62
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:53,960
There has to be this kind of limit on how guilt reveals something positive, I want to say.

63
00:05:55,161 --> 00:06:07,880
It accounts for the steadiness and the constancy of authentic existence by setting up something like what matters to that Daseine.

64
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,880
And the Daseine, of course, can't get behind its moods and its sense of what's important.

65
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:27,480
And yet, it has to, and it can't get behind them in the sense, one, that it can't spell them out, two, it can't get control of them, but they're equally important, I think.

66
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:32,681
Now, I'm just going to go through the chapter, having said that, but that's what's on my mind.

67
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:36,360
And if anybody has more to say about it, let me know.

68
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:47,080
But I don't, it doesn't make me happy to convince you that this chapter is hopelessly confused, and it's the last chapter of a book which in retrospect looks more confused.

69
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:57,560
So I'm going to just put this chapter where I think it belongs and what I think it's doing in the hopes that it won't be, that we can make a coherent, orderly book out of it.

70
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:01,161
So we let's start back on 428.

71
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:13,200
He drops sort of the bombshell about birth on right at the beginning, that the real issue he starts doing, what he starts doing is formal indication, as usual.

72
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:36,560
That is, he's now going to talk about the s the way Dasein is spread out in time, and he's going to do it by telling you starting with the way we normally understand it, both in our everyday understanding and in our traditional philosophical understanding.

73
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,640
Understand it, meaning the way we're related to the series of to time.

74
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,161
And he's going to sh tell us that that's, of course, 180 degrees wrong.

75
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:52,961
So life seems to be a series of momentary experiences.

76
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,960
And first, that's the Cartesian Husserlian tradition.

77
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:05,361
Just as I say it, it seems to me it's not a tradition you can blame on the Greeks already.

78
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:11,841
I wish we had Adam here to know whether Heidegger in some lecture tries to blame it on the Greeks.

79
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:15,121
It seems it's a Cartesian something or other.

80
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:19,600
But in any case, it certainly dominates all of philosophy after Descartes.

81
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:30,880
And the question comes up in Hume and in Kant everywhere, what unifies this series of nows of what Husserl called the living streaming present.

82
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:38,721
Then you have this problem of all these present moments, each one of them fully present, and how does it connect up with all the other moments that are fully present?

83
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:42,000
Heidegger's going to say that's all wrong.

84
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Our experience, and we all believe it too in our everyday understanding, we think of ourselves as living moment by moment when we reflect on what we're doing.

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:14,921
I think Heidegger thinks, though I don't didn't find any place where he said it right out, that if you reflect on what you're doing, that's how you're bound to come up, that's what you're bound to think, that you're having a stream of inner experiences, one right after another, and that's exactly what happened when Husserl reflected on what he called inner time consciousness.

86
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:25,961
That even you can get anybody to think that they, what could they be having an experience of but the present, and then another experience of the present, and so forth.

87
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:32,761
And so those would be a series of momentary experiences, and that's what he's talking about on 425 already.

88
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,921
So let's go back there.

89
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:41,321
I think this has got Husserl in mind, the bottom paragraph.

90
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:46,201
What seems simpler than to characterize the connectedness of life between birth and death?

91
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:53,721
It consists of a sequence of experiences, Erleibnis, would be the technical Husserl term, in time.

92
00:09:53,721 --> 00:10:13,080
But if one makes a more penetrating study of this way of characterizing the connectedness in question, and especially of the ontological assumptions behind it, the remarkable upshot is that in this sequence of experiences, what is really actual is in each case just that experience which is present at hand in the current now.

93
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:18,521
That's exactly what Husserl discovered in his internal time consciousness.

94
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,481
And Heidegger thinks that's wrong.

95
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:24,281
So look on 429.

96
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:27,081
That's about 50 lines down.

97
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:30,520
That is to, I'm still doing formal indication.

98
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:40,201
That takes our historical temporal nature and characterizes it with the help of the time of with time in timeness, as he puts it.

99
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,441
And then it turns out that what?

100
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:49,681
I just want to read something here.

101
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,000
But if this, you'll go on reading.

102
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:03,201
But if this ordinary characterization is to be stripped of its seeming self-evident and exclusiveness, historicality must first be deduced purely in terms of Dasein's primordial temporality.

103
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,241
That's what he's going to try to do later.

104
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:14,401
I mean, that's, he's already done it the way the book is organized, which is so it's funny to, you know, to propose to do it now.

105
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:30,641
But we will get back in the reading, I don't remember whether it's next time, maybe, I think it is next time, but someplace where he is going to do the job he thinks or claims of deducing the periods of nows.

106
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,881
Well, it takes a lot of chapters earlier on to get the series of nows from primordial temporality.

107
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:45,041
This is demanded even by way of these objective, but demanded even by way, by the way, these are objectively connected.

108
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,321
That, by the way, is some peculiar claim.

109
00:11:48,721 --> 00:12:00,961
It's the kind of claim that says, well, you can get real guilt of owing debts to society and owing money out of primordial guilt, though he doesn't say how.

110
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:08,481
And now he's saying, well, you can really get succession out of primordial temporality, but he doesn't say how.

111
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:09,760
I think he doesn't do it.

112
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,560
And how many of you read Blattner's temporality book?

113
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:30,361
Remember, that's the big deal in Blattner's book, that Heidegger fails to deliver an account of how you can, the primordial temporality underwrites and under certain conditions turns into a series of nows.

114
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,681
I'm not sure that Heidegger thinks he can do it or should be doing it.

115
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,561
The right now he seems to think he should be doing it.

116
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:45,241
This is demanded that even the objective temporal moments have to be derived from primordial temporality.

117
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:46,521
Keep that in mind.

118
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,561
That's a huge issue in that little thing.

119
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:54,760
I mean, Bill Glattner claims that Heidegger fails to do what he promises to do here.

120
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,361
I don't remember whether Bill quotes that sentence, to derive succession, which is what this is about.

121
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,481
Temporality has all sorts of characteristics.

122
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,401
Heidegger, I think, has six.

123
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,721
And one of them is succession, which is what we're talking about here.

124
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,920
And the E and Heidegger fails to get it.

125
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,040
I mean, Bill is right.

126
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,321
Bill is very smart.

127
00:13:15,321 --> 00:13:18,521
And Heidegger does not succeed in deriving succession.

128
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,000
But when we get there, I want to claim Heidegger was never trying to derive succession.

129
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,361
But this sentence is a troublesome one for me because I don't think he even claims to try to do it.

130
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:46,040
I don't know why he puts it in here, except it's as if formal indication requires you to claim that the misleading thing you started with is after all made possible by and somehow you're led to the wrong one.

131
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:50,281
That's part of what he thinks he owes, even if he doesn't pay it.

132
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:51,801
So let's see.

133
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:55,641
Time as with timeness stems from the temporality of Dasein.

134
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,721
And historicality and with timeness turns out to be wait, what is this?

135
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:04,681
Since, however, time as with timeness also stems from the hist temporality of Dasein.

136
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,521
And historicality and with timeness turn out to be equiprimordial.

137
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,561
I can't imagine why he thinks that.

138
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:21,681
But I would have thought historicality stretching along was precisely more basic than within timeness.

139
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,761
And that's what he's complaining about.

140
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,080
Well, he's complaining, I see.

141
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:34,641
He could be complaining that Husserl and Descartes have made within timeness, namely succession of moments of time, basic.

142
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,041
And it's not as if he's claiming the opposite, although I think maybe he is.

143
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:53,681
He's claiming right here that you can't try to start with within timeness, that at least equiprimordially were stretched along in a way that is not a series of moments.

144
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,880
Everybody's looking worried.

145
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,121
I thought I was being relatively clear how murky this is, and what I'm going to say gets next.

146
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:04,961
Does anybody have any problems that they can articulate?

147
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:07,520
Okay, I think I've done, let's see, formal indication.

148
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,160
Let me just see.

149
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
So it's not a series of moments.

150
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,440
On 425, I just read it, 429.

151
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,121
I read what I wanted to read.

152
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:16,241
441.

153
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:22,561
He keeps saying it, but somehow I was just trying to convince myself that this is what he wanted to say.

154
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:30,961
So, and now I haven't shown you that everyday Dasein has the experience of a series of moments.

155
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:33,280
I've only said philosophers think that.

156
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,841
But on 441 at the bottom, everyday Dasein has been dispersed into the many kinds of things which daily come to pass.

157
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:58,041
Its opportunities and circumstances which concern each path that we awaiting in advance have faded, have fate as their outcome in terms of which in terms of that with which inauthenticity existing Dasein concerns itself, it completes its history.

158
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,081
It's all dispersed.

159
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm just skipping down.

160
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:07,000
It must first pull itself together from the dispersion and disconnectedness of the things that come to pass.

161
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,320
So everyday inauthentic experience is ju yeah, a a sequence of disconnected events.

162
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:21,081
So no wonder we think of ourselves as having uh being then.

163
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,921
Okay.

164
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:26,761
But so now the question is: well, that's all wrong.

165
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:35,481
That's a quick bit of formal indication, but you're supposed to now believe that that view is wrong, and we have to find out how we are stretched along.

166
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:39,000
Since we are, we're not somehow can be anyway.

167
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,521
We are normally dispersed into a bunch of events, series of events or moments, but we can pull this together.

168
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,681
And when we pull it together, we've got something he calls historicality.

169
00:16:52,680 --> 00:17:02,680
And now the question is to tell us what really is our way of being stretched along.

170
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,880
That's so how are we really stretched along?

171
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:22,601
Well, whatever it is, it's got something to do with the difference between reflection, which gives us, gives people like Husserl, the notion that we are all stream of inner experiences of nows, and how would we get out of that?

172
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:28,680
Well, I think one basic thing is Heidegger wants to talk about the temporality of our involvement.

173
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:46,640
The temporality of using equipment is much less dispersed and much more whole and organized than stretched along than the reflection on our stream of inner sort of Joycean stream of consciousness.

174
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:54,720
And now he's going to take up the way Dasein is temporal when it's involved.

175
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,960
And that's that's historic, going to call that way historicizing.

176
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,601
So that's when historicizing comes in in italics.

177
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:06,400
So let's read it.

178
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,960
Here he's going to define the terms right after where he's talking about.

179
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:21,760
So he's going to clarify the connectedness of life, that is the stretching along, the movement of existence.

180
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,481
Interestingly enough, he says there that he's got two kind words for movement, just you've got to be careful of this.

181
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:39,040
The movement of existence, that's the one he wants to talk about, the Vegtite, is not the motion of something present at hand.

182
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:43,680
So the movement of existence is this involved activity.

183
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,121
Now, just a sort of sub-point that I wasn't even going to mention, but I can't resist.

184
00:18:50,240 --> 00:19:04,081
To tell you how vague the book is, after going to the trouble to distinguish the Vegtite from Bevegung, on 444, he's got B-vegung, where he should have said Bevegtite.

185
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:08,240
Look at the first paragraph at the top of the first full paragraph.

186
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,640
The existential interpretation of Dasein's historicality is constantly getting eclipsed.

187
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,121
The obscurities are all the harder to dispel, and so forth and so forth.

188
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:20,000
And everything is haunted by the enigma of being.

189
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,160
I don't know what that means.

190
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,841
And as now has been made plain by that of motion.

191
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:30,281
But the enigma of motion isn't physical motion.

192
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,480
What he's been talking about is the vague height for ten pages.

193
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:43,561
And I don't, I mean, maybe, you know, I really don't know why.

194
00:19:43,561 --> 00:20:03,001
Why does he introduce the subject as the question about how to understand movement in this involved Dasein sense, and then say the question is motion, which he's back here, defined as the present at hand.

195
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:08,281
What in the world is the enigma of the present at hand doing in this story?

196
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,361
I mean, he needs an editor.

197
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:12,200
So let's see now.

198
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,160
And now we've gotten to the constitution of historicality.

199
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:23,640
That's the subject that this chapter is supposed to deal with.

200
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:33,000
And it turns out, again, I can't help keep coming back to evidence for my view that this is the wrong place for this chapter.

201
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:42,680
As soon as you start to talk about historicality, you end up starting, so to speak, where you left off with anticipatory resoluteness.

202
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,920
434.

203
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
And you see that happening.

204
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,440
He's reviewing what's happened.

205
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:57,960
And at the end of the top paragraph, he's saying, thus the interpretation of Dasein's historicality will prove to be at bottom more concrete working out of temporality.

206
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:09,720
We first reveal temporality with regard to the way existing authentically, regard to that way of existing authentically, which we characterize as anticipatory resoluteness.

207
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,521
How far does this imply authentic historicizing?

208
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,361
Well, that's the right question.

209
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:23,440
He's now going to take up historic, that's why I wanted to put this right, I would put this right after anticipatory resoluteness.

210
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:32,160
He's now going to take up anticipatory resoluteness and see what more you have to add to understand historicizing.

211
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:40,720
And so he says we have defined resoluteness as projecting upon one's own, most being guilty, a projecting which is resistant and ready for anxiety.

212
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,561
Resoluteness gains its authenticity as anticipatory resoluteness.

213
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:49,520
See, he's just reviewing what I would say were the two chapters prior to this one.

214
00:21:49,521 --> 00:22:04,081
And this Dasein understands itself with regard to its potentiality for being, and it does so in a manner that's now here's something interesting that will go right under the eyes of death in order thus to take over its thrownness and so forth.

215
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,240
That's a new way of describing anticipatory resoluteness.

216
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,081
And then comes this puzzling thing.

217
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,240
It takes over its thrownness and to take it over wholly.

218
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,760
So we're back to the zip holy has already been done, because this is what we've done already.

219
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:28,561
The resolute taking over of one's faculty there signifies at the same time that the situation is one which has been resolved upon.

220
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:34,160
You recognize all that, this straight talk from the death chapter.

221
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:44,081
And well, from the from the throw from the guilt and death, from the resoluteness, followed by, I think, the anticipation chapter.

222
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:53,281
Now, another thing we can talk about for a minute, which I think is an interesting open question that I ended up talking a long time in my office about.

223
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:01,880
Granted, that something, some kind of holy something, that the wholeness was supposedly provided by the death chapter.

224
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,520
Now, it looks like it didn't quite manage to do that, because wholeness is still on the table.

225
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:16,920
But how come, how are we supposed to think of being toward death, which is a way of life that constantly takes account of our vulnerability?

226
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,801
How are we supposed to think of that as providing an understanding of wholeness?

227
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:28,920
Heidegger, as far as I know, never tells us, and nobody in the discussion in my office had any passage to tell us.

228
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,361
I have a proposal, but if, and maybe somebody will find some passage somewhere that helps.

229
00:23:34,361 --> 00:24:03,400
I think, if it's really true that death is the way of life that manifests an understanding in its activity of the vulnerability of Dasein to the impossibility of any more possibilities, which is the absolute impossibility of possibilities, he also says, which is, I take it, a description of what happens when your world collapses.

230
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:16,920
It could happen to you on your deathbed, but it can happen to you when the person you care most about leaves you or the job that you've been trained for all your life, suddenly you can't do it anymore, or something.

231
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:30,121
When all your possibilities collapse, then you're you've got more than just I'm trying to see now why did why does the wholeness come in?

232
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:43,440
Well, I think the wholeness comes in is that it's not that the total collapse of all your possibilities doesn't mean just all of the finite possibilities you've got, but all the possibilities you could ever have.

233
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,040
I mean, it's got a totalizing character.

234
00:24:47,041 --> 00:25:01,760
If you're going to live in terms of the total collapse of your total collapse of your way of life, then you've got a sense in that way of living of totality that you don't have unless you do live that way.

235
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:14,640
And so he has a right to bring in his understanding of death once you formally indicate it and the ground of a certain feature of this wholeness.

236
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:25,280
It isn't a kind of wholeness which is sort of nailed down at both ends and doesn't come unzipped, the kind that it looks like birth just unzipped it and after he had it nailed down with death.

237
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:26,801
It's a different kind of wholeness.

238
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:32,560
It's a kind of wholeness which is expressed every moment that Dasein is acting.

239
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,440
Dasein is going about its life.

240
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:50,160
If it does it authentically, its whole life is, so to speak, at stake in this abstract sort of way, that that whole life is vulnerable in this to total collapse.

241
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,880
And therefore there is this sort of dimension.

242
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,040
I mean, if it helps, how many have had Kierkegaard?

243
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:55,760
I forget.

244
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:56,720
Not very many.

245
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,121
I mean, Kierkegaard would call this eternity in time.

246
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:37,321
That is, that there's a feature of your life which is you know already whenever you got it that it applies not only now but from from the beginning to the end and I'm saying in i in this world collapse, you know that if you've got it now, then it applies to your life totally in the sense that every detail that that makes any difference anyway is there was something more I wanted to say about that because it's that something about to oh, yeah, I'm glad I got it back because it's so congential that I would have lost it and felt bad about it.

247
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:38,601
I may have mentioned it before.

248
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:42,601
We're very close again to the book of Jonathan Lear, Radical Hook.

249
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,640
I did mention it, didn't I?

250
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,481
I mean, there's a really existing description of world collapse.

251
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,361
The world of the Crow Indians collapsed.

252
00:26:52,361 --> 00:27:00,601
The America, the na the they everything that made their life meaningful gave it continuity.

253
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:05,001
It was in the minds of the women who were cooking the dinner that the warriors were going to go out.

254
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:06,681
It was in the minds of the warriors.

255
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,121
Everything they were doing was was formulated in a certain way and it collapsed.

256
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:16,280
And it collapsed in a way that has a kind of totality of it.

257
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:17,880
Okay, back to where we were.

258
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:21,640
So death adds the holy.

259
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,480
Where am I with a WH.

260
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,920
Let me see that.

261
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,121
So back to the concrete situation.

262
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:44,040
But now as a way of being so when you hold on to anticipatory resoluteness now in the way he's talking about it, again, you see that it makes you an individual.

263
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,601
It brings you into the situation.

264
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:47,561
That's where I am now.

265
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:48,121
Where's that?

266
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:49,481
Oh, yeah, here we are.

267
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:51,640
On Forest 34.

268
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:59,400
That's where I gave a that was just a little speech on the word holy, right, where it appears above 383 in the margin.

269
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:11,880
The resolute taking over of one's factical there signifies at the same time that the situation, one which has been resolved, signifies at the same time that the situation is one that has been resolved upon.

270
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:25,121
Now, I think the situation that gets resolved upon is now bigger than the Aristotelian phronomus kind of situation.

271
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:31,200
I think the situation that gets resolved upon is your whole life as a situation.

272
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,520
And I think that he thinks that the phronomist, I mean, he never says that the phronomist does that.

273
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:44,720
The phronomist just does the Kairos thing, seizes the moment for this situation and does this thing.

274
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:57,520
But there is another way of holding on to your life which gives it a certain structure from beginning to end, and that whole structures, I think, the situation.

275
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:00,960
Let's see if I can give you any reason why I think that.

276
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,841
No, not right now.

277
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:07,601
And maybe there isn't any, but I think there must be.

278
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:18,480
So that you do the situation of your life and you find the issue for your generation, for your time.

279
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:32,160
These are the sense in which this historicizing is a bigger whole and a different kind of whole than the birth and death at the end of your life.

280
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:59,800
So when you act anticipatorily, resolutely in a way that's called historicizing, then you, I think, see your whole life, experience your whole life as a unified situation, experience the issue for your time, and later, as Heidegger's going to say, respond to your whole culture in a way that could change your the whole cultural world.

281
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,640
All of and that's sort of hinted at.

282
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,841
I mean that's later Heidegger maybe being hinted at.

283
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:24,841
He says uh maybe it's not, maybe it's something else, but he does say on four forty fig and maybe I'm not sure what this is, but he says that that authenticity has to do with fate, destiny, and world history.

284
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:35,321
And so th there's some story later in the chapter about whole worlds being able to die, so that equipment which once had a meaning doesn't have any meaning and why not?

285
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:38,601
Because the world in which that equipment made sense is dead.

286
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:49,721
He's Gordon knows about that in the background, but he doesn't he doesn't talk about world cultural world collapse like the way the medieval gave way to the modern.

287
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:52,520
But he will later.

288
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:55,561
So now death adds the holy, I say.

289
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:56,921
Haven't I said that already?

290
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,640
Have I read it already?

291
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,841
Let me see.

292
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:24,920
Well now we're on to a new thing and that is and this is an interesting one where from from whence we must ask whence in general Dasein can draw the possibilities upon which it factically projects itself and that's going to be again I'm now going to tell you what I think it's going to what I think it says.

293
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:32,040
I think Heidegger makes a distinction I know Heidegger makes a distinction which I missed for years between the tradition and the heritage.

294
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:35,960
If you haven't noticed that, you should note that you should notice that.

295
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,121
Because the tradition is bad, and you aren't used to the tradition being bad, and the heritage is good.

296
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:53,281
The tradition is whatever it is that Dasman thinks, sort of usually sort of fancy people of the higher culture of Dasmann.

297
00:31:53,281 --> 00:32:00,560
But still, Dasmann, the tradition is what they agree on and find a kind of shared intelligibility in.

298
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:02,720
The heritage is the interesting thing.

299
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,640
And what is this heritage?

300
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:24,400
Well, it's, I think, the kind of, again, inchoate, non-expressible reservoir, which, if you get in the right relation to it, will give you new possibilities for acting on and looking at the world.

301
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:31,361
But they're not possibilities already there, the way the tradition has a whole lot to say about what.

302
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:43,121
It's got to do, he has an interesting distinction in the Age of the World picture, which is always on my mind, sorry, in the origin of the work of art, which is always in my mind when I'm thinking about this.

303
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:47,521
The difference between Schaffen and Schrüppen in German.

304
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:50,720
Schaffen is something you do and make.

305
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,560
In particular, he's talking about people who make works of art.

306
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:59,520
Schruppen means the fish of something from a well, I gather, from a reservoir.

307
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:19,680
And you've got to have this, and that's later going to be called the earth, but you've got to, in the origin of the work of art, you've got to have these inchoate possibilities, which you can, by acting on them and projecting them, make them determinate.

308
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:45,480
But to begin with, they're not a kind of repository of a list of explicit ways to act, but they are something, and that's got to do with the mattering too, something which can draw you to act in a certain way, even though you can't understand what you're doing as having a goal and choosing it until you've already acted that way.

309
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:51,800
And that's the sense in which it's something you can't make, schaffen.

310
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:55,161
You can't just do it.

311
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,601
Schaffen means what?

312
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,400
Make, I guess.

313
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,240
I want a better word.

314
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:20,921
It's not something you can just make, it's something that you have to be open and receptive to, which can call you to act in such a way that you will, so to speak, you will later understand the meaning of what you did, that you will later understand that that was the issue for your generation or your time.

315
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:30,441
But it isn't just given so that everybody can see that that's it, or it isn't even given so that it's all, everybody sort of knows it, but not everybody sees it.

316
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:47,561
It's not given at all until you act on it, because it doesn't really become the issue of your time unless you're like John Muir and act on the dangers to the environment, at which point it begins to be an issue and maybe the issue.

317
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:51,320
But it would be too easy if it was already sort of written.

318
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,601
There are all sorts of issues all the time, potential issues, or even that's too determinate.

319
00:34:56,601 --> 00:35:08,761
There's all sorts of attractions and solicitations that could become issues, but only the, but by acting on one or another of them, you make them an issue.

320
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:16,001
That's what acting authentically to take up the heritage is, I think.

321
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:24,801
Does that, I mean, I'm puzzled by last time, everybody had an opinion about everything, and I was lost.

322
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,841
Maybe this shows that I'm not lost, that everybody is quiet because they're listening to me.

323
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:35,521
Okay, well, I'll just go on as if I knew what I was talking about, but I warn you, I don't.

324
00:35:36,800 --> 00:36:05,121
For instance, what I just said is laid out contradicted by Heidegger at a certain point, which made me almost want to throw away the book and give up, because I had just made up this whole story about how you can't choose among the possibilities that make up your thrownness and just project on one of them, that it's got this very important characteristic of having to be made determinate by your acting on it.

325
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,720
That's why it's the, that's what's thrown about it.

326
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,801
That's what it means to say you can't get behind your thrownness, the positive side of it.

327
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,081
But look at this.

328
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:26,640
On 384, I'd love to find the Germanist wrong, but I suspect I already must have looked it up once because I was so unhappy about it.

329
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,721
So let me just start reading, and you notice where I would become unhappy.

330
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:35,521
We're starting where it says 384 in the margin of 435.

331
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:55,280
The more authentically Dasein resolves, and this means that in anticipating death it understands itself unambiguously, in terms of its own most distinctive possibility, the more unequivocally does it choose and find the possibility of its existence, and the lessons who have done so by accident.

332
00:36:55,921 --> 00:37:08,601
After the story I told you, which I hope was convincing, it seems to me phenomenologically, obviously right, I don't understand how you can have your own possibility already there and then go ahead and choose it.

333
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:14,121
And if that wasn't enough, I mean, I'll give him one slip, but it goes right on like that.

334
00:37:14,121 --> 00:37:21,241
Only by the anticipation of death is every accidentality and provisional possibility driven out.

335
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,640
Oh, already crazy, but still.

336
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:32,121
Only being free for death gives Dasein its goal outright and pushes existence into its future, its goal.

337
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:34,680
But I just wanted to say that it doesn't have a goal.

338
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,320
It only finds out what it was trying to do after it did it.

339
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,680
Eugene is funny.

340
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,360
I'm either upset enough or something to tell me about it.

341
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,760
Go ahead.

342
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:48,360
It doesn't give you constancy.

343
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:49,320
You still are.

344
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,720
Well, I see, that's funny.

345
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
I was going to say just the opposite.

346
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,401
Maybe it's even in my notes.

347
00:37:56,121 --> 00:38:08,680
I think guilt gives you constancy in the sense that there is this sort of inchoate mattering which is drawing you on your calling, so to speak, whether personal or cultural.

348
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,521
And because there's a calling, it gives you, your job is to work it out.

349
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:17,640
And as you say, you could work it out in lots of different ways.

350
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,680
But the issue that you have to work out, sort of your calling, that I think stays constant.

351
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:30,440
So I would have thought that guilt gives you a certain kind of constancy, but it leaves you open to another kind of inconstancy.

352
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:37,160
But if you're just sort of responding at random to situations like aphronomists, that wouldn't, maybe that's what you're saying.

353
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:44,560
The guilt that was early on, the aphronomous guilt, is not the kind of guilt that has the right positive features.

354
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,841
Absolutely.

355
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:48,720
And he never tells us very much about the positive features.

356
00:38:48,881 --> 00:39:01,281
He doesn't seem to really understand them until later, when he does this Schofen and Earth story in Origin, which is already eight years later.

357
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:18,640
But because it's true, the Franomis can be just responding to this situation by giving the appropriate gift, and the next day or an hour later, he can respond to that situation by insulting somebody who needs to be insulted and so forth.

358
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:33,680
And that's certainly a bunch of dis a series of non-steady, non-what was your word, steady in his word, you used a different word, not a continuous kind of life.

359
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:58,401
But if you think that thrownness and guilt reveal this other something or other that is the the weight of which, and that is out of which, on the basis of which, which you haven't got as an object and a goal, but but underlies that there is any goal mattering and attracting you, then maybe that does give continuity.

360
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:16,881
It's so confusing because he's got it so little worked out what thrownness is and what guilt is and what maybe that what what the features of what the advantage or disadvantage or well, that's the wrong way to put it, what the phenomenology of not getting behind your throwiness is and what the positive value of that is.

361
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,400
I'm doing this, not him, but I'm sure I'm on in tune with him.

362
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:22,560
Tyler, you look like you want to say something helpful.

363
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:23,280
Talk real loud.

364
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,761
I have trouble hearing you.

365
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:26,160
Neither of what we said.

366
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,481
Oh, well, that's exciting.

367
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:28,761
Anticipation.

368
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,081
Can I just ping it a little?

369
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,200
It sounds too choice like you're supposed to do it.

370
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,160
You ought to do it.

371
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,840
It's what, you know, if you're called to do it.

372
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:50,440
And then if you sort of both in the back list, okay, I don't want to follow my albums.

373
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:57,160
They don't hold the built-in or animal based or within what.

374
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,481
And it's only by having it that you can call up content.

375
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:05,561
I would have thought that was just another formal, empty one, or even more formal and empty than all the previous lists.

376
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:06,920
Oh, there you go again.

377
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:09,320
It sounds so too much in ought.

378
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:13,160
But anyway, can't we just keep saying that you're being called to do?

379
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,121
Conscience calls with no, you know, without silently, but it doesn't say you ought to be doing it.

380
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,561
That's exactly what it doesn't say.

381
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,401
You understand what it would mean to assume all the guilt caused.

382
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:33,801
Only by understanding death is one of almost possibilities would you understand how conscience calls to your own?

383
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,200
Well, it's we're spacking so many issues about death.

384
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:45,241
I don't know if they're important here, but there are two ways that it could be, just to get this clear, give you kind of wholeness.

385
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,961
It could be that final event in your life, which I'm afraid you're talking like that.

386
00:41:49,961 --> 00:42:00,201
I mean, otherwise it's a it's the form of your current activity, which is, I take steady and flexible in the face of possible world collapse.

387
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,761
Uh is there some third thing you're you're I know, that's why I have trouble understanding you, but go ahead.

388
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:07,400
Okay.

389
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,240
Participation has never it's I think it's kind of between it.

390
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:18,321
If the grant is they call these two something, which is not participation.

391
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,440
So constantly, we call two constants in build, which means there's no concern again.

392
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,201
You're called to your own mother, only understand what that all is.

393
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:39,121
And they all come from grasping death as your own monks.

394
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:41,920
And as your own most non-relatable sort of.

395
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,201
I'm assimilating this.

396
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,400
Okay.

397
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,961
So let's try to put it so that it's between.

398
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:56,160
Now I'll put the two and then you tell me the between.

399
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:07,440
So Eugene was saying if you just are resolute like the front of us in the guild chapter, you've got no constancy because you just respond to one unique situation after another, right?

400
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,160
I think that's what you said.

401
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:19,441
And I said, yeah, but there's going to be a kind of constancy, namely that there's some which Aristotle couldn't understand, but which Christians can understand.

402
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:27,761
There's going to be a kind of call for how you should live your whole life, to put it very, you know, crudely.

403
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:33,440
And but anyway, and that that's what gives you constancy, though you'll be doing it in so lots of different ways.

404
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:45,601
It's there is some you've got some style, some mission, I don't know how to put it, some some sense of your identity, which is just the con the commonality the the the constancy of what you're up to.

405
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:46,960
Now, you want a third thing.

406
00:43:47,280 --> 00:44:02,200
We call constancy, uh understand constantly, you have to understand the con the importance of that, but constantly want to go through the end of the day, it'll be there.

407
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,321
Without the graph, you have to understand that.

408
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:10,440
Not as cultural as but not as at the end of your life either.

409
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:18,280
Possibilities are pertaining to the particular bottom, which you can graph it, get a lot of them to graph the constant.

410
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:19,640
I don't know what it is then.

411
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:26,521
I mean, I mean, without the phenomenon, I can't it just, I mean, I'm not, I don't doubt it, but I don't know what it is.

412
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:38,440
What is my own boss?

413
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:43,320
The only way I can graph it to be my own boss would be that, what is my own boss?

414
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:50,440
We need a single particular, I have to somehow press into a set of possibilities and write as my own little single way.

415
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,920
Okay, well, that sounds, I mean, I'll take that over as closer to me.

416
00:44:54,921 --> 00:45:02,840
I mean, although Eugene is r I mean, I Eugene's right about resoluteness, and you're not disagreeing, but you add anticipation.

417
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,520
Maybe that's how to reconcile us.

418
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:10,201
Resoluteness alone would give you a series of uh responses to unique situations.

419
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:23,481
You add anticipation, we're still agreeing, and if the patient gives you something, which I'm calling you're in co-a calling that you won't find out what it is until you've begun to do it, done it.

420
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:33,961
And that's not so far from your saying you're called to do what you you uniquely have to do, and you have to find out how to do it, given the the possibilities available to you.

421
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:35,241
Is that okay?

422
00:45:35,561 --> 00:45:36,680
Isn't it what?

423
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:41,401
You know, you don't find something, you you make something in a way, you make your life.

424
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:42,800
I mean, that's what I think you were saying.

425
00:45:44,481 --> 00:45:50,240
You're called to do whatever it takes, whatever you're called to do.

426
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,241
And then the emphasis is on you have to find that out and do it.

427
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,240
In that call, you're going to read your own ball.

428
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,881
A very particular one?

429
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,960
I guess I think your calling is radically individual.

430
00:46:10,961 --> 00:46:13,841
So I think that's okay.

431
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,321
Let's try this as a test, because this is just another empty term as far as I'm concerned.

432
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,560
Even your calling is an empty term.

433
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,121
I'm trying to find the phenomena.

434
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:33,680
Well, what would it look like to be called in a way that doesn't, because I'm not going to try to say violet here, have to do with choosing a goal.

435
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,801
In fact, it would be just exactly the wrong way to think about it.

436
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:50,401
It would be like having a sense as you do what you do that you're doing well and that things are going well and you're sort of living up to what's best for you.

437
00:46:50,401 --> 00:47:02,800
And every once in a while having a sense that you're, so to speak, off the beam, that you're doing something now, working for this organization or getting involved with this person or teaching in this subject, and it isn't feeling right.

438
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,880
You're not being true to what you can't describe it.

439
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:11,920
I once said it in a paper about Marilo-Ponty in a different situation, but never mind.

440
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:14,320
It's like being on a radio beacon and calling.

441
00:47:14,961 --> 00:47:17,841
You don't have to hear the beacon all the time.

442
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,521
All you have to do is be able to hear when you're off the beam.

443
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:33,160
And then if you just constantly respond by, and if you've got somehow a sense of how far off the beam and in what direction, you just have to be constantly pulling yourself back on your beam.

444
00:47:26,961 --> 00:47:34,041
That's your calling.

445
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,041
And maybe that is that you're nodding.

446
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,880
Maybe that's got something like it.

447
00:47:37,881 --> 00:47:41,640
Because I just don't want to say what your beam is, but I want to say you got one.

448
00:47:43,881 --> 00:47:48,041
There is a very particular framework to say I use their own.

449
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:53,720
That framework has to be understood as individualized deaths.

450
00:47:53,720 --> 00:48:07,640
So as someone's presenting, is it possible that will stay at their own one relative to their particular I don't feel too unhappy.

451
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,040
I mean, I mean, it doesn't seem strange to me.

452
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:17,080
I think to me that's another legitimate way of understanding it.

453
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:25,320
The list of things that describe ontological death are such a peculiar and heterogeneous bunch.

454
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:31,480
I mean, there is just the possibility of having no more possibilities, which is very formal and very ontological.

455
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:38,121
And it looks like, you know, the formula indication has gone too far from maybe from your point of view.

456
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:43,800
And then there is this non-get-overable, utterly unique.

457
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,880
How does it what's the jargon for it?

458
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:49,881
I can't unrelate unrelatable, I suppose.

459
00:48:49,881 --> 00:48:50,440
Is that it?

460
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:51,561
Or which one?

461
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:52,920
Almost, almost.

462
00:48:52,921 --> 00:48:53,880
That's what I'm looking for.

463
00:48:53,881 --> 00:49:01,720
So then there's this almost thing, and that that looks like something more than the possibility of having no more possibilities.

464
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:07,241
It looks like your own your own most possibility of you not having any more possibilities.

465
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,081
And you want to keep that in.

466
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:12,001
And I want to formulize it uh formalize it out.

467
00:49:12,001 --> 00:49:12,640
And I don't know.

468
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,160
I see, and I think we're both right.

469
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:27,921
I mean, myself, I think Heiger's got an undigested, heterogeneous bunch of sort of descriptions of death, and you, the reader, pick the one the ones that you think are the essential ones.

470
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:33,121
I don't think you have, nor do I have, the ungetteroundableness.

471
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:50,961
You could have you could be immortal, in fact, and still have this characteristic of because you don't want it to be on your deathbed that this this related to death thing is, so maybe you'll never come to an end in that sense.

472
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:51,521
Okay.

473
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,960
Well, that's good though.

474
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:55,600
I was feeling that bad that we weren't having any discussion.

475
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:56,081
Yeah.

476
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:57,280
Yeah.

477
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:00,080
Why is he going to say authentic?

478
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,121
Historians?

479
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:04,721
Couldn't we do it for a history historicality in general?

480
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:05,520
Yes.

481
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:12,320
And i instead of authentic histor I see, isn't it that histori ah, ah, ah, I never thought of that.

482
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,400
I I see what you're doing now.

483
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:15,680
Yeah, let me think about it.

484
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:22,480
There's the way he's defined the terms, he's made often he's made historicality authentic.

485
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:28,721
That's that's the way Dasein really is, and that's how it really manifests itself when it's authentic.

486
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,440
That's fine.

487
00:50:29,441 --> 00:50:36,160
But then you have to but you're asking the question, what gives unity to a life that isn't authentic?

488
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:44,640
Why w w doesn't historicality have to cover the fact that even inauthentic people's lives are not falling apart into moments?

489
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:55,921
Or is the move to say, well, inauthentic people's lives are falling apart moment by moment, and that's why historicality equals, has to be talked about only in terms of authenticity.

490
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:57,121
That's what I suspect.

491
00:50:57,481 --> 00:51:05,481
So the whole chapter is about historicality, which is the way that Dasein is held together.

492
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:10,121
Let's look on 427 when he introduces historicizing, see if that helps.

493
00:51:10,121 --> 00:51:15,160
The specific movement in which Dasein is stretched along is historicizing.

494
00:51:15,961 --> 00:51:18,521
The bare structure of historicizing and so on.

495
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:23,801
It immediately goes to the constancy of the self.

496
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:29,081
And it's a specific temporalizing of temporality, self-constancy.

497
00:51:29,081 --> 00:51:33,640
Is historicizing a specific temporalization of temporality?

498
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,241
I don't know.

499
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,601
Let's read this.

500
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:43,240
Everybody read for themselves, starting on 375 in the margin of page 427.

501
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:45,481
Let me tell you what you're asking yourself.

502
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:48,441
Why is Heidegger talking about historicality?

503
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:50,440
Is he talking historicizing?

504
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:55,561
Is that something that only authentic Dasein does, or is that something that all Dasein does?

505
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,001
I can't tell.

506
00:51:57,001 --> 00:52:05,241
I think talking about a specific temporalizing of temporality is a clue that it's about authenticity.

507
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:12,520
Because later he's going to say, or earlier, the way the book is laid out, temporality temporalizes itself in two ways.

508
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:22,361
And if this is a specific temporalizing of temporality, and you'd think with self-constancy too, that must mean the same as steadiness.

509
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:29,561
So historicizing turns out to be authentically stretching yourself along.

510
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:31,081
And your question is still there.

511
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:35,640
What about Dasein when it's not authentically stretching itself along?

512
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,401
Surely it doesn't fall apart into a Cartesian series of moments.

513
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:46,481
At the limit, maybe when it gets its life sufficiently diversified.

514
00:52:46,481 --> 00:53:01,360
But what one needs, and I said it already in passing in a different context here today, namely, you need the temporality of just plain hammering, which is clearly not the present-at-hand temporality of one moment after another.

515
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:08,401
You've got to have the goal, and it's got to infuse everything you do from the moment you pick up the hammer until you hit the nail and so forth.

516
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:10,321
And he doesn't seem to talk about that.

517
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:24,081
If he did talk about it, it looks like he would have to either broaden the meaning of historicizing or, given the way he's using it here, have another word, which he doesn't, which would describe it.

518
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:56,880
I have a feeling he's describing it in basic problems, which we're not going to have a chance to read, because when he gets in basic problems, if I can remember why, yes, if he's trying to find a term that would cover all forms of historicizing, I think, he wants continuity for the ready-to-hand, too.

519
00:53:56,881 --> 00:54:01,121
He only wants dispersion for the present-at-hand, which is what you're just saying.

520
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:03,520
I mean, there has to be a story.

521
00:54:03,521 --> 00:54:08,561
There's something called constancy, and we'll give him that as authentic.

522
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:15,840
But we can't say that being stretched along is only true for authentic Dasein.

523
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:25,841
So he owes us an account of how diffracted people are stretched along.

524
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:26,680
Yeah.

525
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,640
I don't know what the German translation was.

526
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,280
Stretched along.

527
00:54:26,561 --> 00:54:31,081
It seems like a substance.

528
00:54:34,601 --> 00:54:35,960
Yeah, well, it shouldn't.

529
00:54:35,961 --> 00:54:37,480
I don't know what the German is.

530
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,241
Eugene is looking.

531
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,961
But whatever it is, we maybe be able to find a better translation.

532
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:49,241
Oh, it's Erstrechten, Sicstreten, Strechens.

533
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,160
There's a footnote about it.

534
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:54,680
The specific, where is he?

535
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:58,441
Yeah, we're on 427, and there's a footnote to this.

536
00:54:58,441 --> 00:55:01,481
But you could probably get it on your own there.

537
00:55:02,121 --> 00:55:04,280
There's no reason to think it couldn't be better than this.

538
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,920
There's a big mistake in the footnotes in this chapter.

539
00:55:06,921 --> 00:55:09,081
I better tell you about it, but in a minute.

540
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:09,640
Go ahead.

541
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,881
What does it say about Erstrekens?

542
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,320
Stretched along.

543
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:22,121
Yeah, I agree, Delaney, that it does sound like it's too much like a thing, but I don't know what else to say.

544
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,481
Right, it's a constancy of the happening or something like that.

545
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:35,321
Because that could be just just you know, disparate, I can't think of the right word, happenings.

546
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,401
Then we'd be back at the one that the inauthentic person is in.

547
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:44,680
But there has to be some constancy or some unity or something, continuity.

548
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,800
Maybe that's a good word.

549
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:48,121
Constancy sounds too authentic.

550
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:52,280
That's like you've got one calling and you're always on that beam.

551
00:55:52,360 --> 00:56:05,081
I guess there has to be not only constancy, but continuity, or continuity already says, not just one thing after another, but some the way they all hang together.

552
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:06,680
And that he doesn't talk about.

553
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,760
He's really not doing it.

554
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:11,840
But he did say he was going to do birth, but he doesn't, Jimmy.

555
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,481
He's lost sight of it.

556
00:56:12,561 --> 00:56:30,881
He came up for two pages here, right on the top of 425, and then he seems to have lost sight of it until, and that's, remember what I read, this funny thing that I thought was so strange, where all of a sudden the priority of the past gets mentioned again.

557
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,481
Where was that?

558
00:56:33,121 --> 00:56:35,521
441 or something like that.

559
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:35,920
No?

560
00:56:36,081 --> 00:56:37,200
Let's look.

561
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,360
Well, I have it on my notes.

562
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,481
I can find it.

563
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,881
It's on the page.

564
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,441
Try to find it in my notes.

565
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,160
438 and bottom of 438 and top of 439.

566
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,201
Has he remembered to get to get the the past back in?

567
00:56:57,521 --> 00:56:58,400
Well, guess what?

568
00:56:58,401 --> 00:57:03,121
Here's maybe the way out of this, this contradiction.

569
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:07,761
This is the historic historicizing authentic history.

570
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,920
Maybe you think that's different than the historicality of Dasein.

571
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:18,401
I mean, I'm just as desperate, but I'm at the top of 439.

572
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:22,720
At least there's hope that what's the context?

573
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,321
Is he talking about history?

574
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:30,081
He's talking about destiny, the way the historicizing of being with others.

575
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:43,400
Could it be that the historicizing of being with others has to prioritize the past inauthentic existing a way that you know you can where?

576
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:50,001
Oh yeah, how uh we do not study Dasein's ooh no, I don't see where you are.

577
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:50,640
Yeah?

578
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,881
Oh, I see that is important.

579
00:57:59,881 --> 00:58:06,361
So so I I'm wait Historicality is what you get when you're historicizing.

580
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,561
It can't be that there's two different ways of getting historicality.

581
00:58:09,561 --> 00:58:15,241
I don't know, I'm just trying to It's the same as on four hundred twenty-seven, right?

582
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,800
Yeah.

583
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:24,441
So now turns out I was completely wrong, at least since he changed his mind from page to page, I don't know whether I was always wrong.

584
00:58:24,441 --> 00:58:34,441
But right now, what I'm saying looks wrong because it looks like historicizing, as one would have thought, is a characteristic of Dasein, all Dasein.

585
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:52,760
And the fact that he's just dropped the inauthentic historicizing only to bring it up at the very end again, when he's finished, so to speak, is just shows that the question is left open, which is what Eugene said to begin with.

586
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:59,481
He owes us an account of what constitutes the constancy and unity of a Dasein.

587
00:58:59,481 --> 00:59:09,801
Now we could bring in Tyler, not living in terms of anticipating its death, but not just dispersed into a series of moments.

588
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,321
And he doesn't have it.

589
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:11,720
Yeah.

590
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:15,400
The text is even th even within the chapters they're out of order.

591
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:16,841
Yeah, oh poor guy.

592
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,920
Wh why did he have to have this in?

593
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:22,280
And then and then instead of finishing it, he burned it.

594
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,561
And then so we're stuck with the hi Division II as it is.

595
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:31,481
I mean, you may decide, I may decide after this semester that I never want to read Division II again.

596
00:59:32,521 --> 00:59:36,201
Okay, anything else before we go back to where we are?

597
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:38,041
Okay.

598
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:42,121
I don't know where we are, but I'll oh, I was going to tell you about a footnote before I forget.

599
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:49,841
The translators sometimes amaze me in the depth of their non-understanding of what's going on.

600
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,200
Okay, here it is, the bottom of 438.

601
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,041
I guess I would have gotten there eventually, but maybe too late.

602
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,361
Look at this.

603
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,201
The bottom of 438.

604
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,241
He's got authentic temporality now.

605
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,520
This is interesting.

606
01:00:05,521 --> 01:00:09,601
But we've got to go back to the talk that we got with Eugene here.

607
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:10,801
Let's look at that a minute.

608
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,480
The bottom of 438.

609
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,281
Oh, we don't know.

610
01:00:15,521 --> 01:00:16,720
Pretty surprising.

611
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:43,361
Just when he tells us finally that he's been talking about authentic historicality all along, which at least that seems to be consistent, but now he tells us that authentic historicality or historicizing, the historicizing of authentic history lies in having been.

612
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,041
But at least one thing is clear, isn't it?

613
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:50,480
That he clearly thinks that historicizing is something that all Daseins do.

614
01:00:50,800 --> 01:01:12,561
And they can either cover up that they're doing it, that that's what they, then they look dispersed, and in a certain sense they really are because they are what they do, and their activity is dispersed, but somehow structurally as Dasein, whatever that means, they've got historicizing as part of their essential structure.

615
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:20,640
And then the authentic Daseins manifest in what they do, that historicizing is part of their essential structure.

616
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:28,921
What it is to have it as part of your essential structure while not manifesting it, I haven't a clue what the phenomenon is there.

617
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:31,081
And I don't think anybody will, so let's not.

618
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:46,841
But let's look at this footnote, just because at some point we have to talk about what authentic Dasein does, which is make a reciprocal rejoinder to the history.

619
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,280
Oh, one second thought, we have plenty of time.

620
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:58,921
Don't look at it yet, because you won't see how wrong the footnote is unless I tell you the whole story about what reciprocal rejoinders are, and I'm not ready to tell you that yet.

621
01:01:58,921 --> 01:02:05,001
So, but if I haven't got there by five minutes before the end of the hour, yell, and I'll just jump up and jump up there and tell you.

622
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:09,640
So, as if you believe the footnote, you would be totally, totally misguided.

623
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,680
Okay, where are we?

624
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:17,241
I said we shouldn't talk about goals, and I don't know what to do about that, and we shouldn't talk about choice, and I don't know what to do about that.

625
01:02:19,481 --> 01:02:28,281
But one thing is sure: that if I'm authentic, I don't do the general standard thing, I do something like I do my own thing.

626
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,960
Well, so 435, and where are we?

627
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:40,760
I want to say it's still got to do with the choose and goal quote, which I already read, but I'll read it again where it says 384 in the margin.

628
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:57,561
The more authentically Dasein resolves, this means anticipating death, it understands itself unambiguously in terms of its own most distinctive possibility, and that's what Tyler was saying, the more unequivocally does it choose and find the possibility of its existence, and the less does it do so by accident.

629
01:02:57,561 --> 01:03:02,841
Only by the anticipation of death is every accidental and provisional possibility driven out.

630
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:10,601
Only being free for death gives Dasein the goal outright and pushes existence into its finitude.

631
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:12,640
Okay, I don't know what more to say about that.

632
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:22,081
Well, and it takes it out of comfortableness, shirking, taking things lightly, and all that kind of Dasmanish-like stuff.

633
01:03:22,401 --> 01:03:26,081
And I think, yeah, okay.

634
01:03:26,561 --> 01:03:30,240
Now then I was saying, which I'm just going to read my notes, but I've already said it.

635
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:40,321
So we have some kind of sense of what matters, what's worthy, what we feel good when we're doing it, and some and what we feel wrong when we're doing it.

636
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,961
And that kind of sense is something that's in our throne.

637
01:03:44,961 --> 01:03:51,121
And guilt and conscience do that job.

638
01:03:51,121 --> 01:04:14,240
So conscience ends up doing something like conscience, except it doesn't tell you any particular oughts, but it tells you the way I want to read it, it tells you when you're on the beam and when you're not on the beam, and it tells you that by not stating any propositions or rules or anything that either making you feel good or bad about how it's going with you by way of your mood.

639
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,760
Ah, somebody else wants to say something.

640
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,240
That's great.

641
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,201
Say something.

642
01:04:17,601 --> 01:04:18,961
I couldn't hear you.

643
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:20,800
What about when an accident's calling?

644
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:21,920
Well, okay.

645
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:23,360
Ah, good point.

646
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,560
Oh, I like that.

647
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,520
I don't I hope you can save us from goal as easily.

648
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:44,881
It chooses and finds, yeah, there's always this idea that Aristotle's notion of choice is what we should be having and not some kind of Kantian notion of choice, where choice means that there were several there were several alternatives, and you in fact did one of them.

649
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:50,121
I take it that's what the the Greek word that gets translated choice means.

650
01:04:50,121 --> 01:04:58,601
Whereas we think of choice as making a decision where you entertain the alternatives and take one of them.

651
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:01,561
So you choose chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla ice cream.

652
01:05:01,881 --> 01:05:15,881
Whereas you could say that I chose to come in the front door of the classroom instead of the back door, and it could mean this very weak sense of choice that there was two doors and I went in one of them.

653
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:24,921
And that's and maybe that's, and you're saying, why not make choice mean that of all the possible options, I didn't entertain them and then decide for one of them.

654
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,801
I just got called into one of them.

655
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,841
That's good.

656
01:05:29,081 --> 01:05:35,721
Let's try to let's say that, except, of course, the same bad way of thinking is in terms of the goal.

657
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,321
It gives Dasein its goal outright.

658
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,320
I wonder, now we need the German.

659
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,280
Maybe it isn't goal.

660
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:47,961
Goal is because if we could knock both choice and goal out of the game, that would be nice.

661
01:05:47,961 --> 01:05:51,160
Goal's a pretty straightforward word, unfortunately.

662
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,481
Yeah, I can't hear you.

663
01:05:53,481 --> 01:05:55,880
There's just enough noise out there with my hearing.

664
01:05:55,881 --> 01:05:57,160
So you have to talk a lot louder.

665
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:01,881
Anyway, the people in the podcast world will be very happy if you just yell.

666
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:08,041
Governor Decken was saying that perhaps you might think of Dasein for the sake of which.

667
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,841
When we think about maybe the big goal.

668
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:17,241
Well, if you I see that you're for the sake of which, it better not be treated as a goal.

669
01:06:17,881 --> 01:06:30,841
And we had a discussion of that in my office in this long discussion because you're for, I have to get it back in mind, you're for the sake of which is sometimes a particular goal, like building a shelter.

670
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:47,441
But then Heidegger says that's very close to your stand on your own being, but that's not your stand on your own being, having a goal of building, being a sh being a shelterer is not ultimately what kind of stand it does and takes on its being.

671
01:06:48,001 --> 01:06:56,961
And so if you but if you think of the for the sake of which, the authentic for the sake of which, you may want to call that a goal, as long as you don't.

672
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,240
What's wrong with goal?

673
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:58,960
Let me just say that.

674
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:06,160
What's wrong with goal is it's in coming at Surah, it's representations of your conditions of satisfaction.

675
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:10,881
It means you know exactly already what you're trying to do and bring about.

676
01:07:10,881 --> 01:07:15,440
And it's the sort of thing which you can separate from actually bringing about.

677
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:18,321
So you entertain a description of the goal.

678
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,160
My goal is to get straight A's this semester.

679
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,640
And that's certainly not what's going on here.

680
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,800
Because the for the sake of which isn't propositional like that.

681
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,201
You can't spell it out as a goal.

682
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:39,041
It's more, I mean, whatever it is, like you're calling, isn't a goal.

683
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:41,601
You can't sort of put it on your calling card.

684
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:47,201
And that, and the for the sake of which isn't a goal.

685
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,121
And maybe he never calls it a goal.

686
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:49,760
I don't know.

687
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,481
What's he call it here?

688
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:53,280
The zeal.

689
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,001
Ah.

690
01:07:54,001 --> 01:07:55,760
Okay, well, that's goal, all right.

691
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,720
And the question is, and I doubt if he ever calls the for the sake of which your zeal in that sense.

692
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:13,360
That would just be a nutty thing to do, that all of your behavior is aimed at achieving something specific, which you can state now and which you can either succeed or fail in achieving.

693
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:18,081
That's certainly not the for the sake of which, and it shouldn't be this either, I think.

694
01:08:18,081 --> 01:08:19,360
Okay, yeah.

695
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,001
That's right.

696
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:26,240
Do we stand back and look at the alternatives?

697
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:34,440
Yes, at our own life as if it was a not actually that we're outside of the world, but something that they don't arise in?

698
01:08:34,841 --> 01:08:35,400
Well, that's good.

699
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:37,400
You see, that's exactly what I said.

700
01:08:37,641 --> 01:08:53,880
Yes, if it means that you were called to do this rather than that, or that you just spontaneously did this rather than that, if that's all that it means, then it's o then you've managed to take away the part that that makes it seem too reflective.

701
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:54,840
Yeah.

702
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:55,640
That's right.

703
01:08:55,641 --> 01:09:12,520
He kn he should, if he really is making that kind of either Aristotelianizing or formalizing, you know, formal indication, if he's taking one of the most sort of central meanings of choice and dumping it, he ought to tell us.

704
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,041
That's what you're saying, right?

705
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:17,160
I guess it sort of calls you out of Dasman, doesn't it?

706
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,961
But of course it can't really call you out of the world.

707
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:39,961
And he says that you're always in Dasman, but it calls you out of, well, I mean, one way to put it that I put it last semester, it calls you out of conformism, but it doesn't call you out of conforming, because if you didn't conform, you couldn't speak and you couldn't do it, you'd just be a nut.

708
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:48,760
But it does call you out of the sort of approved way of doing things.

709
01:09:48,761 --> 01:09:55,480
But it leaves you in an acceptable way of doing things, which you don't do them because they're acceptable.

710
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,841
Okay, all that is so.

711
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,360
No, no, that's right, it's all in the background.

712
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:20,800
So the the important thing is not that, but but w for me, whether you can state the conditions of satisfaction, I mean, you don't choose for the sake of which, you don't choose what you're going to do in the sense that you don't you can't state the goal except insofar as you're sort of being drawn to to do something or other.

713
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:23,280
And you don't find out until you've done it what you're being drawn to do.

714
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:28,001
Do you think of the model of somebody who's s a sculptor or something or a potter?

715
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:37,200
They don't have in their mind already, I mean as though sometimes Plato thought they they did, they don't have a model that they're trying to achieve.

716
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,280
They won't find out until they get done what they were trying to do.

717
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,160
And yet they chose to make this pot.

718
01:10:44,801 --> 01:10:46,400
That's the funny part of it.

719
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:52,001
But if you ask them, if you say, well, what did you have in mind before you finished the pot?

720
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:56,640
They didn't have a goal in mind and they didn't choose to bring that goal about.

721
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:04,800
What they had in mind was to make something that when they had made it, they know that it was what satisfied them and they were glad they made it and they would stop.

722
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:13,121
Instead of success conditions, they've got, I don't know what, ex acceptability conditions.

723
01:11:13,121 --> 01:11:15,280
That's not quite right, but you see what I mean?

724
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:22,720
They have in mind that when they get there, they'll know they're there and they'll have done what they, quotes, chose to do.

725
01:11:22,961 --> 01:11:25,200
But they didn't choose and they didn't have a goal.

726
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,961
Yes, that's what I but yeah.

727
01:11:26,961 --> 01:11:32,320
It's it's let me see, I had it once, a way to talk it in in in surrog language.

728
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,400
So it's the conditions of satisfaction.

729
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:42,720
And there are two kinds of conditions of satisfaction, success conditions and conditions of improvement.

730
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:47,840
The success conditions are when you have in mind exactly what you're trying to do and you know when you've done it.

731
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:50,640
Conditions of improvement are my beacon story.

732
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:58,600
You know when you're off the beam and you know when you're on the beam and in the end you you you'll know when you're when you you don't have to do it anymore.

733
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:04,360
That's a kind of condition of sat that's a condition of satisfaction, but it's different than the success condition.

734
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,001
You get this in Marilla-Ponty for sure.

735
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:13,560
I think Heidegger ought to have this view, but it's not clear to me that he's got it.

736
01:12:13,721 --> 01:12:15,400
Did I see another hand?

737
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,041
No?

738
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:17,640
Okay, back to where I am.

739
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:18,280
How are we doing?

740
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,560
We have time, I think.

741
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,640
Anyway, we'll get where we get.

742
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:23,640
I have to make some.

743
01:12:23,961 --> 01:12:32,200
I don't know if this is helpful, but I want to say that I act without doing the general standard thing.

744
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,640
Did I already talk about that?

745
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:34,921
Yes, that's what I just taught.

746
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:36,520
Yeah, right.

747
01:12:36,921 --> 01:12:43,640
But now I want to say I have to make some practice and role from the heritage my own.

748
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:48,200
Again, this might be Tyler-like talk, and I think that's right.

749
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,840
And what is it to make it your own?

750
01:12:50,841 --> 01:13:06,121
Well, it's something that you can only do if you understand that the heritage isn't a bunch of rules that are already settled, like the Constitution for your culture or something like that.

751
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:12,520
You see that the whole heritage has two things, new things the heritage doesn't have.

752
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:22,841
It isn't explicit, and it has no ultimate authority, except insofar as I take it up and make it explicit in the living of it.

753
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:26,680
I'm just saying again what I think is in the throne story.

754
01:13:26,681 --> 01:13:30,041
And I don't have any new quotes, so I shouldn't get stuck there.

755
01:13:30,921 --> 01:13:43,200
The tradition is this codified thing, the way Heidegger thinks of it, where you can say what the situation is, and you can say what you ought to do in that situation, and you can choose to do it.

756
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:52,720
That hasn't got the right kind of feeling of the indeterminateness of the thrownness.

757
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:54,961
Okay, now let's see.

758
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,720
I've got a bunch of examples.

759
01:13:56,721 --> 01:14:13,600
I gave you the beacon example that you could think another case where people, somebody spends their life working hard and making all signs of sacrifices to become something which they can't at first understand what it would be like or why they want to do it.

760
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:30,720
Say to becoming a ballet dancer, you better start at the age of five and ache and ache all over and sacrifice everything else, but you don't really understand, so to speak, the internal goods of being a ballet dancer and why it's rewarding and something to do and do it your own way, too.

761
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:35,680
All of that you only get in the doing, as you master it.

762
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:38,961
And so, but again, I've said enough about those.

763
01:14:38,961 --> 01:14:41,280
I'm going to try to skip examples.

764
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:48,081
But you're supposed to take the repeatable possibilities and repeat them in such a way as to make them uniquely yours.

765
01:14:48,081 --> 01:14:54,240
I feel that that's what Tyler and I may be agreeing about, and I'm feeling that I don't really understand it.

766
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,440
But I'm getting closer.

767
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:16,081
I mean, the way the ballet dancer makes these possibilities in our heritage of being a ballet dancer uniquely his or hers is having to develop their own style, having to make all kinds of sacrifices to do it, having a sense of when they're doing it right and when they're not doing it right, all of which is part of that background.

768
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:22,640
And that's all got to do with, I think with the with resoluteness, not with anticipation.

769
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,881
You were vision block behind that thing.

770
01:15:32,121 --> 01:15:34,680
Something else would love to say that why that for you?

771
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:36,200
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

772
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,520
I have a lot of trouble understanding the own part.

773
01:15:45,881 --> 01:15:47,081
I think that others do.

774
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,440
I don't think so.

775
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:52,680
I think that she should she should know that it's whatever it is for it to be her own.

776
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:55,081
She's got to just do it, know it on her own.

777
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:00,360
I don't if she takes it from others that and sort of calibrates the difference from the others.

778
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,720
I don't know, but it feels even a difference.

779
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:07,801
That's right.

780
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,001
I was going to get to that.

781
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:14,200
Definitely that you have to open up the possibilities that you've been thrown into.

782
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,240
And that means what for you?

783
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:21,560
Looking on the throne at the foundation of what one's ever done.

784
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:28,680
That makes sense to be going on basis than my own.

785
01:16:28,761 --> 01:16:30,440
It's isn't that pretty definitely?

786
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,320
I mean, the trouble is Heidegger gives us so little to go on.

787
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,680
I have a different story.

788
01:16:34,681 --> 01:16:37,640
Yours has got death and anticipation important in it.

789
01:16:37,641 --> 01:16:47,240
And I'm afraid, for me, yours is closer to the text because the the anticipation is all over the place and the de and and resoluteness and thoroughness.

790
01:16:47,480 --> 01:17:01,160
I would want to say about the ballerina, she becomes sensitive to the goods of the practice and that that's the heritage and that by becoming sensitive to the goods of the practice, she's done what you ought to do.

791
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:06,520
She's made her own reciprocal rejoinder to the the practice part.

792
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,320
So I'm we're not disagreeing, I think.

793
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:19,921
She has to make her own rejoinder, that's your story, to the heritage in the culture, which makes it possible to be a ballerina at all, and the goods of being a ballerina.

794
01:17:19,921 --> 01:17:22,001
That's also got to be in there.

795
01:17:22,001 --> 01:17:26,801
So it ought to be anticipatory-resolute, and you're doing the anticipatory, and I'm doing the resolute.

796
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,081
Yeah.

797
01:17:28,721 --> 01:17:29,920
What's that?

798
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,160
How do you get the goods of the practice?

799
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:32,720
I don't know.

800
01:17:32,721 --> 01:17:33,680
That's the heritage.

801
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:36,640
I think that's, you can't, I don't know how to get behind that.

802
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:49,600
The culture gives you the understanding of these practices which are something that you can devote yourself to.

803
01:17:49,921 --> 01:17:53,520
And I mean, you get it.

804
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:58,240
Maybe that's, you shouldn't stop with that, but I don't know what you could do more.

805
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,480
And I haven't even got Heidegger talking that way.

806
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,720
That's sort of what virtue ethics talk and Heidegger talk.

807
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:05,520
Is there something more?

808
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,801
There's not much more to say.

809
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:09,200
And maybe Heidegger, I mean, what is the heritage?

810
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,240
That's one way to put it.

811
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,320
You got a story about the heritage?

812
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,121
I see.

813
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:20,961
Well, the phronymous in the I mean, I see the phenomenon makes sense.

814
01:18:20,961 --> 01:18:36,240
I mean, there is in the culture an understanding of why it's good to be a doctor or a ballet dancer or and why it's not good to be a drug dealer or something like that.

815
01:18:36,721 --> 01:18:43,600
And being sensitive and really appreciating the goods of being a doctor or a nurse or a drug dealer.

816
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:50,240
A nurse is a kind of drug dealer, too, I suppose, but we shouldn't get them confused.

817
01:18:50,480 --> 01:19:05,081
Anyway, so it ought to be, I mean, but let me ask you all, I mean, it's important to think about what's supposed to be this heritage, which isn't the tradition, but which is some kind of resource out of which you are supposed to be able to.

818
01:19:05,081 --> 01:19:08,921
You've got to re you look like you found a place to talk about heritage.

819
01:19:08,921 --> 01:19:10,121
Is that what you're looking at?

820
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:11,400
Yeah, let's look at heritage.

821
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,840
What page are you on?

822
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,320
Everything's on 435.

823
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,921
We never seem to get past it.

824
01:19:16,921 --> 01:19:18,841
Oh, yeah, heritage in the second paragraph.

825
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:20,280
Okay, let's try that.

826
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,640
An example of Heidegger's worst.

827
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:26,841
It's just gibberish.

828
01:19:26,841 --> 01:19:29,480
If I got that in the paper, I'd give it a C minus.

829
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,880
It goes from point to point.

830
01:19:31,881 --> 01:19:33,480
Nothing gets explained.

831
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:40,520
It switches from resoluteness to anticipation without explaining what the resoluteness did and why.

832
01:19:40,681 --> 01:19:42,760
Now we've got to anticipation.

833
01:19:43,801 --> 01:20:00,041
Some roughly, it's trying to say that on the basis of the heritage in which you're thrown, you have to take over authentically, somehow do it your way, and that's where death and anticipation come in.

834
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:04,041
So at the beginning of the paragraph, you can see that there's a sort of an order in it.

835
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:09,400
So it starts out talking about resoluteness and the heritage and the handing down and so forth.

836
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:14,280
And then it talks about how you have to take over it in your authentic way.

837
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,440
And then death comes into it.

838
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,840
And choosing and having goals comes into it.

839
01:20:20,841 --> 01:20:21,881
And that's it.

840
01:20:21,881 --> 01:20:26,200
I mean, that it all is sort of very floating around.

841
01:20:27,081 --> 01:20:28,520
Okay, onward.

842
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,440
Well I'm s like we've got to get beyond 435.

843
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,760
So where are we?

844
01:20:34,761 --> 01:20:36,921
Well, there's this this since now.

845
01:20:36,921 --> 01:20:39,720
We finally got to reciprocal rejoinders, I think.

846
01:20:40,121 --> 01:20:43,841
So you've got to take over something that's there in the practices.

847
01:20:44,001 --> 01:20:57,041
You can't just come in like a genius and Heidegger hates the romantic ideas of geniuses who just come in and make something all marvelous and new out of their own inner brilliance.

848
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,440
You can't do that from Heidegger's point of view.

849
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:04,720
You have to take over the resources of the heritage and then do something with it.

850
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:10,640
And the and now there's a little more to say about what you can do and why well how you see what to do.

851
01:21:10,641 --> 01:21:11,920
Yeah, go ahead.

852
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:13,280
You going to say something about that?

853
01:21:13,841 --> 01:21:15,200
Go ahead, say something.

854
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:22,160
I guess the reason why it would be it would be different from traditional possible authentic systems can't be deworlded.

855
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:25,360
It also can't be controlled by Dasman.

856
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:31,360
Don't sign a Dasman dependence, so it has to have to rely on the possibilities.

857
01:21:31,841 --> 01:21:32,320
That's right.

858
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:39,360
There's no other source of anything but in the activities, the Dasman, the norms of the culture, right?

859
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:48,160
So it seems like heritage is in some way the half medium between being deworlded and being dominated by.

860
01:21:48,801 --> 01:21:49,841
Okay, well I I like that.

861
01:21:49,841 --> 01:21:52,160
Let me make another the next move.

862
01:21:52,160 --> 01:22:01,920
How would you get in what would it be like to get in such a position where you were sort of in the Dasman world, but not really, but not completely out of it either?

863
01:22:01,921 --> 01:22:08,640
And I I think Heidegger has a story about this, an interesting story, and that's where the reciprocal rejoinder stuff comes in.

864
01:22:08,641 --> 01:22:13,440
But I in my language, what you need is to be sensitive to anomalies.

865
01:22:13,761 --> 01:22:18,480
There isn't a kind of unity in the Dasman practices.

866
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:38,680
There are some, you know, bumping up against others, like at the time of Martin Luther King, the practices of keeping the Afro-Americans in their place and the practices of Christian love and justice were certainly bumping up against each other, and the way the African Americans were being treated was an anomaly.

867
01:22:38,681 --> 01:22:46,680
And somebody could be sensitive to that and take that as their kind of calling to fix that, like Martin Luther King did.

868
01:22:46,681 --> 01:22:53,400
And it would be sort of unintelligible because there's no, you can't, there are no rules for when you should fix it.

869
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,760
I mean, it's been around a long time.

870
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:56,680
Why not just leave it around a little longer?

871
01:22:56,681 --> 01:22:58,200
Or why didn't we fix it earlier?

872
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,160
Or whatever.

873
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:09,240
So you find these anomalies, and then you can take them up, and that gives you, I think, does that help you now?

874
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,280
What's your first name?

875
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,240
I forget again.

876
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:12,520
Yeah, Devin.

877
01:23:12,761 --> 01:23:14,200
I mean, Devin, so look at that.

878
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,520
Martin Luther King is in the culture.

879
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:32,600
He's got the resources of the culture, justice and Christian love, and he's got this anomaly, and that keeps him from just doing what everyone does, namely keep on treating the Afro-Americans just like they always have treated them, or roughly.

880
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:39,640
And that keeps him also sort of based in the culture, because what he's doing is intelligible to him and others.

881
01:23:39,801 --> 01:23:41,720
He could make sermons.

882
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:59,240
And what a reciprocal rejoinder amounts to is you take something out of the back of the culture and you give it a new importance and a new sort of position, and in that way you change what is the issue for your time.

883
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,520
That's what happens.

884
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:06,920
That's what you should be, that's what you're called, authentic people at their best, I think, do that.

885
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:20,240
They take up an anomaly, they act on it, and in acting on it, they transform the practices of and they change the issue for their time and they transform the practices.

886
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,680
Stealing like yeah.

887
01:24:22,001 --> 01:24:23,440
Okay, this, this, this.

888
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:24,320
Okay.

889
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:26,480
Who acting loud, loud.

890
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,560
Think of the podcast people in my hearing.

891
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,640
Oh, good, that's a reciprocal rejoinder.

892
01:24:32,641 --> 01:24:33,440
That's right.

893
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:40,961
There are all kinds of good gender reciprocal rejoinders and anomalies that you can create or respond to.

894
01:24:40,961 --> 01:24:46,400
And yeah, Judy Butler, who certainly knows Heidegger, maybe sees this in Heidegger.

895
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:46,721
I don't know.

896
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:49,200
Have you ever said it was a reciprocal rejoinder?

897
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,961
Okay, yeah, yeah.

898
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,721
Well, I bet they got her brother.

899
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:59,520
I mean, it seems like that not only would they, you know, have an understanding of the norms, but they would be kind of expert.

900
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,921
I mean, they would have a the norms themselves would show up sharply.

901
01:25:03,921 --> 01:25:17,680
He, um, when he started out his career, you know, he actually along with other artists at the time, and he over time his, you know, constant practice and expertise to kind of get his own voice.

902
01:25:17,761 --> 01:25:25,121
That's found a lot like for everybody, or many people in our career, and some somehow get out of that.

903
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:32,081
Okay, but that's not as that that's not quite what he's talking about here, because he wants this higher thing now.

904
01:25:32,081 --> 01:25:32,801
We switched.

905
01:25:32,801 --> 01:25:34,560
I mean, that's what you could do in your own life.

906
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,840
Get your own style.

907
01:25:35,841 --> 01:25:42,560
But this is now historicizing in changing what is the issue for your time.

908
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,160
And that, then you have to be sensitive to these anomalies.

909
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,200
And I mean, it w there's nothing about reciprocal rejoinder.

910
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:58,280
It isn't as if the musician has to take up some problem left left in the in our notion of music and respond to it.

911
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:05,081
I suppose they could, but that's theoretical well maybe that's what well then that uh that could do it.

912
01:26:05,081 --> 01:26:18,041
Uh i it but the the uh I think Heidegger's thinking more of sort of shared public practices than shared big issues like what I said, like like taking up the environment.

913
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,041
Why is nobody worrying about when the Sierra Club was worrying about it and what's his name?

914
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:23,961
I mentioned it before, I forget.

915
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:54,121
Yeah, but Muir was worrying about it and national parks and so forth, then that was something that you could take up as something which should be paid attention to and isn't being paid attention to, and you could feel that you were being called to pay attention to it, and if you did, you would be that would be historic, that would be authentic, historicizing, and it would change the issue for your time, or it could if you were able to carry it out, make it work.

916
01:26:54,121 --> 01:26:54,680
Yeah.

917
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:57,560
That's too I see.

918
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:00,041
You couldn't be called to pay attention to it.

919
01:27:00,041 --> 01:27:02,041
Well, depends on how you describe the it.

920
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:11,400
You certainly can't be called to pay attention to the need for national parks, but you could feel you can be called you can feel that nature is suffering, something like that, right?

921
01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:13,320
That that's how it would be.

922
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:21,560
And then you could eventually sort of articulate that as, well, what I'm going to do is back national parks.

923
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,440
Yeah, okay.

924
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:26,440
There is sort of the other side that it's sort of five.

925
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:39,081
At its most, in as I understand it, it's at its most res uh not just resoluteny, but anticipatory resoluteny and something else even more, histor historically.

926
01:27:39,081 --> 01:27:51,920
This fits with Delaney because it's not as if I mean, because it's not as if you were describing more something like resoluteness, where the uh phronomist becomes more and more perfectly attuned to the culture.

927
01:27:51,921 --> 01:27:57,680
But and that's and Heidegger thinks that that is that is the fullest kind of resoluteness.

928
01:27:57,681 --> 01:28:18,160
But if you also have anticipatory in your behavior, that means that you don't just take the current practices and sort of sharpen them up and polish them up and become an expert at them, but you're sensitive to the anomalies in the practices and you change the culture and the practices.

929
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:27,440
That the aphronomist studies the culture and the practices, as I understand it, and I think as Heidegger understands it, he just does the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

930
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,600
But he doesn't change what counts as the appropriate thing.

931
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,081
He just has a sharper sense of it.

932
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:35,520
Sensitive to what other people wouldn't notice, right?

933
01:28:37,121 --> 01:28:39,041
Oh, I remember.

934
01:28:45,121 --> 01:28:47,360
I'm not listening to you because I'm looking at this for a minute.

935
01:28:48,081 --> 01:28:49,520
This is listening to you.

936
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,001
Go on, but talk loud.

937
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:03,680
Well, you okay, but you haven't got the reciprocal of the reciprocal rejoinder.

938
01:29:03,681 --> 01:29:10,400
I mean, you can't any more deal with nature the way the these the Homeric Greeks or the Medievals or whatever.

939
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:20,560
You could sense that there's something not working with our relation to nature, and you can take up the role of somehow dealing it with nature, but you've got to do it in your own new way.

940
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,001
I mean, take Martin Luther King.

941
01:29:22,001 --> 01:29:35,240
I mean, he, with with his marches and his non-violence and so forth, he was taking up the role of really most leading the people to the promised land in the last lecture, in the last sermon.

942
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:39,320
But he was different Moses, leading them in a different way to a different promised land.

943
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,760
That's part of it.

944
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,560
I don't think about all of you all of them.

945
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:53,480
But I guess the matter comes by the means of common labor and right in fact for America.

946
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:57,801
We have what we did there was they called.

947
01:29:57,961 --> 01:30:04,600
Well, that's you could read it, what you're saying just the other, I mean, the other way, or make make it Heideggerian.

948
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,041
Sure, the gospel is full of all kinds of possibilities.

949
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:37,081
And to make a reciprocal rejoinder, you've got to find some, you've got to re be sensitive to some anomaly and then line out of this amorphous myth, which is the Bible, something that gives you a role, like a Moses role or a prophet role or a Savior role or whatever role it is that you you feel drawn to and do it and then it would be a reciprocal rejoinder.

950
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,121
Let me read some text.

951
01:30:38,121 --> 01:30:43,800
You're all talking, wait a minute, you're talking too much about without anybody knowing what we're talking about.

952
01:30:43,801 --> 01:30:50,920
So let me I think I want to begin, how about 438?

953
01:30:50,921 --> 01:30:53,720
Because we haven't even got to reciprocal rejoinders yet.

954
01:30:53,721 --> 01:30:56,041
And I want to be sure we do.

955
01:30:56,681 --> 01:31:01,961
Okay, here it's the, I guess it gets introduced at the top of 438.

956
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:04,600
I just want to make sure I haven't missed anything.

957
01:31:04,921 --> 01:31:08,520
Look at the italics on 437 just to make sure we haven't missed anything.

958
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,440
That's just what we've done.

959
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:24,800
That whole paragraph from the beginning to the end of the fourth time is so far what he says is acting, that is to act with not only authentic but anticipatory historicality.

960
01:31:25,761 --> 01:31:42,480
The anticipatory is going to have to do the role in there of getting rid of any thought that any of this is grounded in some way in God's eunuchical kind of commands or in nature or in reason or anything.

961
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:48,720
You've got to have gotten rid of all that through the anticipation part.

962
01:31:48,721 --> 01:31:54,320
And then you get it all together at the top, very second line.

963
01:31:54,320 --> 01:32:08,081
Only if death, guilt, conscience, freedom, that's a kind of choice, and finitude reside equiprimordially in the being of an entity as they do and care, can that entity exist in the mode of fate?

964
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:11,680
That is to say, can it be historical in the very depths of its existence?

965
01:32:11,681 --> 01:32:18,160
So we now found the most, almost most extreme form of authentic historicality.

966
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:22,640
But it's not the most, and that happens in the next paragraph.

967
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,801
One, you don't have to know explicitly what you're resolving on.

968
01:32:26,801 --> 01:32:28,320
That's a good thing.

969
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:37,680
And you can't, if you lean what to do explicitly from the way Dasein has been traditionally understood.

970
01:32:37,681 --> 01:32:41,200
Notice that's not the heritage, that's the tradition.

971
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:48,760
The resoluteness which comes back to itself and hands itself down, becomes the repetition of the possibility of existence that has come down to us.

972
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:59,480
Repeating, this is now the rejoinder, repeating, handing down explicitly, repeating, it doesn't have to do this explicitly, though.

973
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:03,240
I mean, what is he going to call it when it isn't repeating?

974
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,360
I don't know.

975
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,961
Let me go on.

976
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,640
I'm worried about this just a second.

977
01:33:09,641 --> 01:33:19,881
Well, you can, again, like Martin Luther King, okay, the extremist ones take over some possibility and bring it into the current situation.

978
01:33:19,881 --> 01:33:21,961
So then you hand it down.

979
01:33:21,961 --> 01:33:39,800
The authentic repetition of a possibility of existence that has been, the possibility that Dasein may choose his hero, so Martin Luther King has his hero, it's Moses, is grounded extinctly in the anticipatory resoluteness and so forth, loyalty to the footstep of that which can be repeated.

980
01:33:39,801 --> 01:33:47,640
So you're going to do something Moses-like in a situation which is certainly very un-Moses-like, and that's fine.

981
01:33:47,961 --> 01:33:51,560
So it doesn't just do the past in order to repeat the past.

982
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:54,760
Now comes the reciprocal rejoinder in italics.

983
01:33:54,761 --> 01:33:59,801
The repetition makes a reciprocal rejoinder to the possibility of that existence which has been there.

984
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:04,840
But when such a rejoinder is made to this possibility in a resolution, it is made in a moment of vision.

985
01:34:04,841 --> 01:34:07,160
Okay, that's where moment of vision comes in.

986
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:13,320
You see the whole situation, but that means a much bigger situation than the Franomus sees.

987
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:22,041
It's the, you see the issue for your time or your people or whatever, something big enough to devote your life to.

988
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:28,360
And as such, it is at the same time a disavowal of what's working itself out as the past.

989
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:33,800
That is, you don't just do what the tradition did or says you should do.

990
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,440
That's good.

991
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:39,720
I think that's all I need there for the moment.

992
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:43,921
So I say there, you give birth to yourself on 442.

993
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:46,720
Let's see what that is at the bottom.

994
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:53,680
The self-resoluteness against the inconstancy of distraction is itself steadiness, which has been stretched along.

995
01:34:53,681 --> 01:34:58,081
You see, we're getting, insofar as this chapter makes sense, it's now being added up.

996
01:34:58,081 --> 01:35:19,760
Stretched along, the steadiness with which Dasein, as fate, incorporates into its existence birth and death, and birth comes back there finally, and they're between and holds them as thus incorporated, so that in such constancy, Dasein is indeed in a moment of vision for what is world historical in its current situation, which is now a big thing, the current situation.

997
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:23,200
It's sort of the state of the world, or at least the Western world.

998
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:28,881
And of course, you can't have this resoluteness understood as the series of experiences, he says, on the next page.

999
01:35:29,121 --> 01:35:35,920
That goes back to the beginning where he formally indicated these experiences and got rid of them.

1000
01:35:36,721 --> 01:35:40,400
In resoluteness, I'm now in 443, about a third of the way down.

1001
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:50,081
In resoluteness lies the existential constancy, which by its very essence has already anticipated every possible moment of vision that may give rise, arise from it.

1002
01:35:50,081 --> 01:35:55,041
As faith, resoluteness, the freedom to give up, now comes flexibility.

1003
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:57,680
And all the pieces are running around.

1004
01:35:57,681 --> 01:36:03,280
Remember, you not only need steadfastness, but you don't get hooked on your thing.

1005
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:11,520
If it turns out that it's impossible to do or turns out to be dangerous in some way that matters to you, you may have to back off.

1006
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:19,520
So as faith, resoluteness is freedom to give up some definite resolution and to give it up in accordance with the demands of some possible situation.

1007
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:25,121
The steadiness of existence is not interrupted thereby, but confirmed in the moment of vision.

1008
01:36:25,121 --> 01:36:26,320
That's good.

1009
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:30,200
Okay, now let's see if I, where I get from there.

1010
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,880
443.

1011
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,001
Well, there's more about birth, so I want to read that.

1012
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,560
At the top of 443.

1013
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:43,480
At the bottom of 442, at the very bottom, in the faithful repetition of possibilities that have been.

1014
01:36:43,480 --> 01:37:07,400
Now, this is for Dasein now finally at its total, because now it's got resoluteness and chronomus-like stuff, but it's also got resoluteness for the whole situation because it's got anticipation which can bring you into relation to the whole situation and can bring you into relation to your unique relation to the whole situation.

1015
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,041
And all of that is in there now.

1016
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:19,001
And so Dasein brings itself back immediately, that is to say, in a way that is temporarily ecstatical to what already has been before.

1017
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:37,081
But when its heritage is thus handed down to itself, its birth is caught up into its existence, so we're catching up on birth and coming back from the possibility of death, possibility not to be outstripped, if only so that this existence may accept the thrownness of its own there in a way which is more free from illusion.

1018
01:37:39,001 --> 01:37:42,200
That's about as thumbed up as it gets.

1019
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:45,961
And it's pretty abstract, but we filled a lot in, I hope.

1020
01:37:45,961 --> 01:37:49,320
Resoluteness constitutes the loyalty of the existence to its own self.

1021
01:37:49,881 --> 01:37:51,640
Resoluteness is ready for anxiety.

1022
01:37:51,641 --> 01:37:53,160
That's got to be in there.

1023
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:57,480
That's one of the ways to see that nothing is grounded and settled.

1024
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:05,320
It's all up to you not to just sort of step back and choose, but it's up to you responding to your what's calling you.

1025
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:15,121
Disloyalty is at the same time a possible way of revering the sole authority which is a free which a free existing can have in revering the repeatable possibilities of existence.

1026
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:16,081
That's pretty important.

1027
01:38:11,721 --> 01:38:17,041
I mean, that's the heritage.

1028
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:31,041
I mean, don't ask me where it comes from, but in our practices, there are these resources which are not explicit but can be acted on, and you have to, and that's the only authority.

1029
01:38:31,041 --> 01:38:32,480
That's pretty extreme claims.

1030
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:37,360
Just remember, no rational not rationality, not God, not nature.

1031
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:42,961
There's no higher authority than the possibilities in the heritage of the practices.

1032
01:38:42,961 --> 01:38:49,200
Don't ask me to, you know, justify this or explain it even, but I'm telling you what Heidegger thinks.

1033
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,360
Yeah, I think that's it.

1034
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,280
Let me see now where we go.

1035
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,880
Well, here's a different example.

1036
01:38:54,881 --> 01:39:03,520
Instead of doing it on the whole world level, I have another reciprocal kind of rejoinder example: what it is to be a father.

1037
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,881
That's in the heritage.

1038
01:39:04,881 --> 01:39:11,600
I mean, there is in the culture a whole rich and full of anomalies understanding of what it is to be a culture.

1039
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:24,081
You have to be the lawgiver for the family and the protector of the family, the money maker of the family, and the exemplar of leadership.

1040
01:39:24,081 --> 01:39:25,760
I don't know, all of that stuff.

1041
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:37,920
And so, but when you were a father, you have to make a reciprocal rejoinder to all that stuff and take up some role of being a father.

1042
01:39:37,921 --> 01:39:41,680
But you don't have to do what people have done up to now.

1043
01:39:41,681 --> 01:39:48,001
You don't have to choose between whether you're going to be a tough lawgiver or a protector or something.

1044
01:39:49,761 --> 01:40:01,160
And you don't have to do what one does, namely what fathers do on TV or in movies, but you've got to do something to preserve and perpetuate the role of father.

1045
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,360
I'm going to say, or teacher.

1046
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:05,720
I get these two together in my head because they're the only two roles I've got.

1047
01:40:05,721 --> 01:40:11,240
So you've got to take up and perpetuate and preserve.

1048
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,680
the role of teacher and father.

1049
01:40:12,681 --> 01:40:14,280
But you don't have to say that to yourself.

1050
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:28,121
I certainly never said to myself, now I've got a father, boy, I have a big responsibility to make sure that the heritage of the role of father gets brought into a new relation to the current situation.

1051
01:40:28,121 --> 01:40:30,520
And the same thing about teachers.

1052
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,160
But you do have to do something.

1053
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:49,961
My example, which I have to assure you is not based on my own experience, but I mean, I can imagine a father who feels now that he has to no longer be an authority, but be like a brother to his own son.

1054
01:40:50,200 --> 01:41:02,520
That is, that it would be, it's a whole, I mean, it's somehow implicit already in some aspect of fathers that they are sort of bonded to and confiance of their son.

1055
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:07,961
So let's say this father thinks of himself as kind of a brother to his son.

1056
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:10,041
And maybe this is my far-fetched example.

1057
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:12,600
So the son is then smoking marijuana.

1058
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:25,320
The father can be a tough authority and say, no more, you're grounded, or take him to a therapist, or smoke marijuana with him and discuss what its advantages and disadvantages are and so forth.

1059
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:37,160
I would think that would be in the 60s, anyway, when I was a father, a perfectly good way to deal with your children's relation to drugs.

1060
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:45,761
Parenthetically, my children went to a French bilingual school in which they thought all drugs that weren't wine were dangerous, stupid fiance.

1061
01:41:45,841 --> 01:41:52,881
And so my kids never had a chance to even understand that there were attacks into something like marijuana.

1062
01:41:53,121 --> 01:41:58,400
I remember a day in which they came home to talk and said, We've heard the Beatles smoke marijuana.

1063
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,400
Tell us they didn't do that, Daddy.

1064
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,560
And of course I said, Well, they didn't inhale.

1065
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:03,680
What can I say?

1066
01:42:05,841 --> 01:42:13,840
But so anyway, it's a constant job to take on these roles as an individual.

1067
01:42:13,841 --> 01:42:20,881
You don't have to be a world-transforming Daseine to be making reciprocal rejoinders to the heritage.

1068
01:42:20,881 --> 01:42:22,400
I think that's important.

1069
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:37,121
So you also have, you can have a fate, and you can have finite freedom, and you can express this whole long thing again of guilt and conscience and death and anticipations.

1070
01:42:37,121 --> 01:42:41,761
And how does that get to the historicality one?

1071
01:42:41,761 --> 01:42:47,841
Because I want to, well, I guess we just, and historical, like we just added it in this chapter.

1072
01:42:47,841 --> 01:42:49,600
That's what the chapter did.

1073
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,760
And now I think that might be it.

1074
01:42:51,761 --> 01:42:59,920
The temporality of authentic historicality as the moment of vision of anticipatory repetition.

1075
01:43:00,081 --> 01:43:03,280
That's what he's talking about at the top of 44.

1076
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,280
Okay.

1077
01:43:05,921 --> 01:43:07,760
Oh, yeah, I knew there was one more thing.

1078
01:43:07,761 --> 01:43:10,160
Whoever talked about opening up Daseine?

1079
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:22,160
It's got to be open to these possibilities, to the future being different, to being called to do things that haven't been done before, and so forth.

1080
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:25,440
This is on 438, the top.

1081
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,720
The repetition makes a reciprocal rejoiner of the possibility of that existence that's been there.

1082
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:38,840
When such a rejoinder is made to this possibility and resolution, it's made in the moment of vision, and as such, well, no, that's not going to do what I want.

1083
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:41,160
Where's what?

1084
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:43,880
Oh, 437, where?

1085
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,760
All the above.

1086
01:43:46,761 --> 01:43:47,560
What?

1087
01:43:47,881 --> 01:43:49,001
I just can't hear you.

1088
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,360
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1089
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,240
Yeah, I get ha-didn't I read that once already?

1090
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,520
No?

1091
01:43:54,841 --> 01:43:55,480
No?

1092
01:43:56,121 --> 01:43:56,520
No.

1093
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:57,640
Well, let's read it.

1094
01:43:57,641 --> 01:44:06,760
Only an entity which in its being is essentially futural, so that it is free for its death and can let itself be thrown back upon the factical there, shattering itself against death.

1095
01:44:06,761 --> 01:44:22,680
That is to say, only an entity which is futural is equoprimordially in the process of having been can be handing down to itself the possibility it has inherited, take over from its own throne, take over its own thrownness, and be in the moment of vision for its time.

1096
01:44:22,681 --> 01:44:25,640
Oh, yeah, that's an important one, because that's where I get the phrase it's time.

1097
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:34,200
The other place is the bottom of 36, where he talks about the faithful destiny in and with its generation.

1098
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,041
I think that's all very important.

1099
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:38,200
What?

1100
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,680
I think, yeah, you don't?

1101
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,680
Well, let's go back then.

1102
01:44:42,841 --> 01:44:57,240
You just asked the question to which I gave a sort of an answer on 436, where he talks about at the bottom of that, there's that funny whole paragraph about shared historicizing.

1103
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:01,640
And then at the end, only in communicating and in struggling does the power of destiny become free.

1104
01:45:01,641 --> 01:45:08,360
Dasein's faithful destiny in and with its generation goes to make up the full authentic historicizing of Dasein.

1105
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:21,360
You see, so there it looks like its time means it's got to be it either got to be sensitive to the issue for its generation, or even more authentically, to det make the issue for its generation.

1106
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:27,200
I mean, it needn't be nu it needn't be that the big issue is global warming, as Bohr thinks.

1107
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:33,200
Maybe it's nuclear proliferation and that soon everybody's going to have their own hydrogen bomb, as some other people think.

1108
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:39,840
Or maybe it's none of those and somebody's sensitive to some issue which we haven't even we aren't sensitive to yet.

1109
01:45:39,841 --> 01:45:53,920
But it's finally the most authentic Dasein seems to be involved in this shared historical destiny of the community of people.

1110
01:45:53,921 --> 01:46:02,320
What's funny about that paragraph, this is just my own sort of remark, but do you notice how out of keeping with the rest of it is?

1111
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,160
The rest of it's all about fate.

1112
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,440
It could be, as Tyler thinks, all about individuals.

1113
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:14,480
And my example, father, is it doesn't say much about its generation.

1114
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:19,200
In fact, once it mentions its generation, and once it mentions its time.

1115
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:42,721
And yet he wants to say that this very not only is destiny middle of 436, destiny something put together out of individual fates, but he wants to make the strong claim, I don't know where he gets it, that Dasein, at the bottom where it says 385, that Dasein's fate destiny in and with its generation goes to make up the full authentic historicizing of Dasein.

1116
01:46:42,721 --> 01:46:48,001
So now it looks like he's going to build that in, the social dimension, in this paragraph.

1117
01:46:48,001 --> 01:47:05,160
Well, my little joke about this is I picture Hannah Arendt reading the manuscript and saying, but Martin, you haven't mentioned the fact that there's a society of people and that there's a community and there's the whole shared destiny of the community.

1118
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:10,280
So, and she writes this in the margin the way you write when you're correcting papers, and Heidegger just puts it in.

1119
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,520
You're reading this in a hurry.

1120
01:47:12,841 --> 01:47:14,041
Yeah, yeah, well, that's a good idea.

1121
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:19,081
Because it isn't motivated, nothing comes out of it, but there it is.

1122
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:24,041
The other thing that I'm saying, I'm just saying this time is left.

1123
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:27,560
The other, no, first I want to, now I have to do the footnote.

1124
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:32,200
Then I'll tell you my final sort of Hans Hooger joke about this part of it.

1125
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,921
But, okay, now look at the bottom of 438.

1126
01:47:34,921 --> 01:47:43,400
Remember, I said only after we did reciprocal rejoinders could I tell you what's crazy about the translation.

1127
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:45,160
So look at footnote one.

1128
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,360
Where is footnote one?

1129
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,921
So we can see what this translation is trying to translate.

1130
01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:50,520
Anybody see one?

1131
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,041
When you do, yeah.

1132
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:52,520
What?

1133
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:53,560
Five lines, one.

1134
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:54,760
Okay.

1135
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:59,400
Yeah, I guess I've covered it up with marks.

1136
01:47:59,801 --> 01:48:02,600
Five lines, one, two, three, four, five.

1137
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:03,880
Yeah, it's covered up.

1138
01:48:03,881 --> 01:48:08,280
So something about the disavowal of that which is taking place working itself out.

1139
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,881
And it's about repetition.

1140
01:48:09,881 --> 01:48:15,640
Now, the footnote says about making a rejoinder.

1141
01:48:15,641 --> 01:48:18,200
So let's, it says, where can we begin?

1142
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,001
Okay, five lines from the bottom of the page in the footnote.

1143
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:29,240
The idea seems to be that in resolute repetition, one is having, as it were, a conversation with the past.

1144
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:30,841
So far, so good, right?

1145
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:48,640
In which the past proposes certain possibilities for adoption, but in which one makes a rejoinder to this proposal by reciprocating with the proposed possibilities as a sort of rebuke to the past, which one now disavows.

1146
01:48:49,280 --> 01:49:03,840
So that is, it makes it sound like the reciprocal rejoinder is to say, well, it looks like this is important in the past, but you don't want to do what looks like it's important.

1147
01:49:03,841 --> 01:49:09,840
Let's read the passage again, because as I read it now, I thought maybe he could s make sense in the footnote.

1148
01:49:09,841 --> 01:49:14,001
Whether the repetition makes the reciprocal rejoinder to the possibility.

1149
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:25,440
Yeah, the reciprocal rejoinder made in a moment of vision is not always a disavowal of what today is working itself out in the past, I don't think.

1150
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:32,480
And it's certainly not the essential feature of reciprocal rejoinders that they have to disavow what's working itself out in the past.

1151
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,121
I still think the footnote is very misleading.

1152
01:49:35,121 --> 01:49:42,800
The main thing of a reciprocal rejoinder is that it affirms and takes up and elaborates something from the past.

1153
01:49:42,801 --> 01:49:48,001
So the footnote is sort of off, at least, and maybe just dead wrong.

1154
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,480
Yeah, I'm not, so let's just don't be confused by it.

1155
01:49:52,480 --> 01:50:01,360
The p a reciprocal rejoinder is positive, and it may have an accidental consequence of disavowing something from the past.

1156
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,881
But that's not its job.

1157
01:50:02,881 --> 01:50:03,121
Yeah.

1158
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:05,280
I think the footnote is right.

1159
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,961
Disavowal is the right translation, but I think it should just be like responding.

1160
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:09,761
That's right.

1161
01:50:09,761 --> 01:50:11,280
Yes, disavowal is wrong.

1162
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:12,480
That's another way to put it.

1163
01:50:12,801 --> 01:50:17,280
They built the disavowal into the German because they misunderstood.

1164
01:50:17,681 --> 01:50:19,520
I was trying to say that, but I didn't quite.

1165
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,921
So don't believe that there's a disavowal in at all.

1166
01:50:21,921 --> 01:50:24,720
It's a response to the period.

1167
01:50:24,721 --> 01:50:34,600
So the footnote, just fixed it, cross out the disavowal in italics in the fourth line, and put in a response to.

1168
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:41,800
Okay, now you may wonder, and this is my final sort of joke about the construction of this messed up manuscript.

1169
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:48,520
It didn't say anything about the stuff from Count York on page 449.

1170
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:59,001
And I don't know about you, but I've read this over and over, and I can't understand a word of it or what Heidegger thinks it has to do with what he's talking about.

1171
01:50:59,001 --> 01:51:02,440
If anybody does and wants to write a paper explaining it, let me know.

1172
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:11,240
Hans Fluge's explanation is the book was a little short, so he started throwing in sort of undigested quotations from other people without explaining them.

1173
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:12,600
Well, that's how it looks.

1174
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:21,800
I mean, it looks like, why is you ask yourself, why all of a sudden does he throw this in here without ever telling you what he finds important in it?

1175
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:28,041
Maybe the bottom of 452 is one of the moments I thought I understood something.

1176
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:32,760
But historical knowledge is, for the best part, knowledge of hidden sources.

1177
01:51:32,761 --> 01:51:36,520
With history, what makes a spectacle and catches the eye is not the main thing.

1178
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,360
The nerves are invisible.

1179
01:51:39,081 --> 01:51:41,640
Such as the essentials in general is invisible.

1180
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:49,400
Well, the sort of, you could say hidden sources is the heritage, but that's as near as I could come to seeing anything in here.

1181
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:51,320
Did you have any trouble?

1182
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:57,560
Did you guys read it and have trouble understanding why it was in here, or did it just seem no more strange to you than the rest?

1183
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:00,200
I mean, anyway, don't feel you have to read it.

1184
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:02,760
I think it does it doesn't help.

1185
01:52:02,921 --> 01:52:07,560
I think he just put it there because that was it was lying around.

1186
01:52:07,881 --> 01:52:09,160
Okay, let's see.

1187
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,760
Is there anything else we need to talk about?

1188
01:52:10,761 --> 01:52:16,881
It's coming to you you've been brave sitting through two hours of this.

1189
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:23,121
Go go and have some go and have take a rest, have something interesting to to eat or drink.

1190
01:52:23,121 --> 01:52:25,360
Uh is there anything I should say for next time?

1191
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,081
I don't think so.

1192
01:52:26,081 --> 01:52:27,920
Just we're going on.

1193
01:52:27,921 --> 01:52:28,640
Yeah.

1194
01:52:28,961 --> 01:52:32,160
Oh, well that, wow, you see there was something important.

1195
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,520
I knew there was something important.

1196
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,720
Oh, that's very important.

1197
01:52:34,721 --> 01:52:37,041
We have to make we have to make some, what?

1198
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:42,001
Well, you and I have to yeah, but you when are we going to meet to do it?

1199
01:52:42,961 --> 01:52:44,640
Over the weekend.

1200
01:52:44,961 --> 01:52:48,801
Okay, yes, we should get them on the website uh right away.

1201
01:52:48,801 --> 01:52:49,841
How come none of you asked?

1202
01:52:50,081 --> 01:52:55,200
Did you think that you would have to make up your own topics or the or we would forget that there was a paper?

1203
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:58,400
Or anyway, is that too late?

1204
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:03,600
Does anybody just feel that they want to write up work on their paper this weekend and need the paper topics this weekend?

1205
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:08,640
I'm ready to get them on the website this weekend if there's if if there's popular demand.

1206
01:53:08,641 --> 01:53:10,480
Okay, if not, let's meet on Monday.

1207
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:11,841
Let's come up and talk to me about it.

1208
01:53:11,841 --> 01:53:14,160
Then we'll have it on the website by Monday evening.
