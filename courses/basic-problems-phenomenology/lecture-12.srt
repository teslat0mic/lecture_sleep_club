1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
I think that there are two different ways to understand the whole project of the temporal part of Division II.

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:20,881
And that is a Blattner way, which is really a Kantian way, which is asking about being as that that determines beings as beings.

3
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:27,600
And he asks about that there's going to be some kind of structure and it's going to provide a kind of explanation.

4
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:39,040
And I said last time, and I'm still trying to figure it out, that doesn't feel right to me if the other half of the sentence is that being is that on the basis of which being is already understood.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:56,241
And what one ought to be getting is a phenomenological description of that, not some explanatory Kantian-like structure which tells you how come there is cause and substance and objective time in terms of rules for synthesizing experience.

6
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:06,000
It somehow that's the wrong any attempt to say that this is a kind of explanation is it doesn't feel right.

7
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:09,281
So but it but then, what is primordial temporality?

8
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,641
I mean, this is the question.

9
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:18,520
I mean, I tell you, this is a very peculiar lecture in the sense that I'm going to talk about stuff that I don't really understand at all.

10
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,440
The question really is, what is primordial temporality?

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,400
And this is again related to last time.

12
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:44,040
I want to say that it's a phenomenon that you ought to be able to describe, and it's that on the basis of which beings and Dasein are already understood.

13
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:48,600
That's and that's very different.

14
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:53,480
And another way to put the way Bill and I differ is, again, there's two ways to go.

15
00:01:53,481 --> 00:02:03,321
He knows that the Vorauf Hin, which gets translated all kinds of ways in this translation and is hopelessly messed up, but there are two right ways to translate it.

16
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:10,921
That on the basis of which, which is how I understand it, and he keeps saying that in terms of which, which is very different.

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,001
He wants to explain some kind of, put something in some other words.

18
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:21,480
I guess that's what in terms of which means, literally anyway.

19
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,800
And I want to say, no, no, that's not it.

20
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:32,761
You want to describe a phenomenon so fundamental that everything else happens on the basis of it.

21
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:39,881
That is, Dasein can be inauthentic, Dasein can be authentic, Dasein can cope with the ready back and so forth.

22
00:02:41,481 --> 00:03:09,041
And I want to relate that, and this is what I was saying before, while you were gone, Eugene, to this puzzling remark that ought to settle something between Bill, a way of reading it and me, on page 383, which is full of strange things, about eight lines down, the ontological source of Dasein's being is not inferior to what springs from it, but towers above it in its power from the outset.

23
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:14,481
In the field of ontology, any springing forth is degeneration.

24
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,641
I'm not, I don't know what that means.

25
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,641
Do you have any idea?

26
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:25,281
But I want to say that it must, I mean, I want to read it.

27
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,520
I don't know how Bill is going to understand it.

28
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:40,241
But I want to read it as saying, well, the richest experience or phenomenon, let's say phenomenon, is temporality temporalizing itself.

29
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:47,201
And that's going to be the basis on which all the rest takes place.

30
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:58,001
And you're going to be always sort of leaving out the most fundamental basis when you describe all the things, the levels of stuff that can take place on it.

31
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:58,721
I don't know.

32
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,601
I leave you that.

33
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:03,361
Anybody who can write a paper on that sentence, that would be very nice.

34
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm going to go on.

35
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:23,520
I want to say, you know, and I'm trying to make a certain case, and I didn't run into anything in the chapter that just stopped me cold, although I did run into a question from Eugene, which almost stopped me cold, but I think I have an answer for it.

36
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,881
I'll get there in a minute.

37
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:41,761
But I want to say that what's the that on the basis of which everything that is understandable gets understood, and everything that you can cope with gets coped with is the background coping.

38
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:51,001
The background coping is a very peculiar phenomenon about which Heidegger never said anything very helpful in Division I.

39
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:57,720
And I don't think he said anything very helpful about it in Division II, except that he says it's very dark and he can't say anything about it.

40
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:08,121
But what it is, is the fact that whatever this background coping is, it's more basic than intentionality.

41
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,800
It's more basic than any kind of structure.

42
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,240
It's in a certain way extremely simple but hard to get a grip on.

43
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,881
It's a kind of coping practice which doesn't have success conditions.

44
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:26,520
It doesn't even have improvement conditions.

45
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,360
It's a kind of coping which is just finding your way around in the world.

46
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:36,920
Or, to take his usual local place, finding your way around in a familiar room.

47
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:53,641
On the basis of that orientation and familiarity, you can have intentionality, you can use doorknobs and open windows, you can stare at the doorknobs and describe their properties, you can do all the kinds of intentionalistic things, both primordial.

48
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:06,201
Remember, he has two kinds of intentionality: primordial intentionality, which is coping with the ready-to-hand, and conceptual intentionality, which is dealing with the unready-to-hand and the present-to-hand.

49
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:18,920
All that takes place on a background of coping, which he says is, he says temporality is not itself a kind of intentionality, but it's what makes intentionality possible.

50
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,600
I can't remember where that is, but that's definitely something that he said.

51
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,040
And it's got to be unified.

52
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:30,520
It gives you a world.

53
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:50,801
And how to describe the background coping practices when you're at, as they are a phenomenon, when you're actually absorbed in coping with them, is the question, I think, of this chapter, though it never comes out so clearly.

54
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:56,960
Because in the end, you've got to keep your eye on the end of the chapter to see why this makes sense.

55
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,080
In the end, it turns out that what one wants to understand is transcendence.

56
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,160
Primordial temporality is what makes transcendent possible.

57
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,121
And there are three kinds of transcendence.

58
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,240
Well, I'm jumping way ahead, but now that I've started, I want to say it.

59
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,481
Because there's transcendental, there's transcendent, and where are they all?

60
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:34,641
So there's transcendence of the sort that goes out of the subject toward the object.

61
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:36,321
That can't be it.

62
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:51,201
There's transcendental of the sort in Kant, which is a structure that makes all, makes, holds the world together and things together and makes experience possible.

63
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,801
It can't be that.

64
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,561
But it's something which he calls transcendental.

65
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,920
The end of the chapter.

66
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:00,400
Transcendental has disappeared from the book.

67
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,281
I have to call in somebody to find it.

68
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,361
There's a section which we were just ready for called, with Transcendental in the Title, the one you asked me about.

69
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:12,641
Where is it?

70
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:13,761
It's gone.

71
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:19,721
And it's because you asked me about it that we're in this way back there.

72
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,241
Okay, I'm in the wrong area.

73
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:24,680
Page 415.

74
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,520
Yeah, well, no, that's there are two ends.

75
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,400
That's the temporal problem of the transcendence of the world.

76
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
That's where we're going to end up.

77
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:49,641
But I can tell you, somehow, if you describe the phenomenon on the basis of which we can cope with and encounter anything that we encounter, if you describe it right, you're going to be able to understand how Dasein is its world existingly.

78
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:53,881
That is, how Dasein isn't a subject that goes outside of itself.

79
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:59,161
That would be the traditional kind of representational intentionality.

80
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:07,001
It isn't even a coping something that deals directly with things, which would be Heidegger-Merleau-Ponty kind of primordial intentionality.

81
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:10,041
It's even more outside of itself than that.

82
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:21,481
Just to read you the place where this comes out clearly, that Dasein is the world existingly is one of the places.

83
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:27,641
But now I have to go back to the very, so four, I remember it's 477.

84
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:28,360
No?

85
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:35,961
Now I'm trying to find the place where he says that Dasein is the outside itself in and for itself.

86
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Well, if I did this in the right order that I wrote it, I would have all the pages.

87
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,601
So let me stop this and go to the order.

88
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,721
Something 77, 377, I got the wrong, I went to 477.

89
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,241
Okay, yes.

90
00:09:49,241 --> 00:10:04,560
So temporality is a kind of outside itself, more outside than either the representational intentionality or primordial intentionality.

91
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:11,601
As he says right below 329, temporality is the primordial outside of itself in and for itself.

92
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,481
That's the problem of this chapter.

93
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:18,961
And that's also really worldhood.

94
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:20,641
That turns out to be the clearing.

95
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:22,081
It gets mentioned in a minute.

96
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,681
It turns out to be the open, the there.

97
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:41,920
All of those names are the names for a phenomenon which is more basic than, and that on the basis of which all coping takes place.

98
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:56,081
And how to describe that phenomenon when you haven't got any of the normal philosophical tools, even intentionality, is what this weird chapter is trying to do.

99
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,041
So and I think Bill has just missed it.

100
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,481
And I'll say another thing.

101
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:07,280
I'm saying all the things that I think about it, and then I'll sort of read it in order.

102
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:21,761
It seems to me that this is going to also have to answer this issue about why Heidegger says primordial and authentic when he describes temporality temporalizing itself.

103
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:31,361
And there's a whole thing in which Bill claims rightly that he must just mean originary because after all authentic temporality is intermittent.

104
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:48,160
But I think he thinks, this is what I'm going to argue, that there isn't any way for us to describe finally the background, pure coping of our being or being in the world, as finding our way around in the world.

105
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:55,961
The best you can do is find a paradigm case of it, which is the most perspicuous.

106
00:11:55,961 --> 00:12:05,641
And that will be a case in which Dasein's temporality and the unity of Dasein's temporality will become actually experienced.

107
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,920
It'll be a phenomenon.

108
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,361
That's what authentic Dasein allows you to say.

109
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:17,481
Lots about the towards which and anticipation and about the thrownness and the always already in.

110
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:22,281
All of that gets an interpretation in terms of authentic Dasein.

111
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:39,321
And I think the whole point of saying both always primordial and authentic, I think he wants to say it is primordial, and the way we have to describe it is through the way it's manifest, and that is authentic.

112
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,321
Now let me just read because I get always getting off from what I'm saying here.

113
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:43,961
So on top.

114
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,721
385 I want to start.

115
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:52,280
That's what I take to be about the background coping.

116
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:59,001
So look at the I want to start with the temporality of understanding.

117
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:02,281
It seems to come out clearly in that.

118
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:17,721
So at the beginning of that little section, with the term understanding, we have in mind a fundamental existentiale, which is neither a definite species of cognition, not explaining and so forth, nor cognition at all in the sense of grasping something thematically.

119
00:13:17,721 --> 00:15:18,641
Understanding constitutes rather the being of the there in such a way that on the basis, that's I'm sure of Oral Finn, on the basis of such an understanding, a Dasein can, in existing, develop the different possibilities of sight looking around and just looking in all explanation one uncovers understandingly that which one cannot understand and all explanation is thus rooted in Dasein's primary understanding and that primary understanding I think is this understanding this familiarity with with the world and it seems to be more basic more primordial than even the understanding as for the sake of which there's understanding as primordial coping namely hammering there's understanding as the unready to hand namely deliberating and such that he talks about and there's understanding it's even more basic namely the for the sake of which and there has to be something even more basic than the for the sake of which namely that on the basis of which Dasein is the kind of being that can have a for the sake of which that's what this is supposed to be about I think but the best you can get at it just like the best you can get at it is to talk about the for the sake of which because you to how to talk about the the unity of the coping practices that are constantly there in the background and make all intelligibility and all intentionality possible is something he doesn't know how to do and probably maybe can't be done yeah that in good and one course something actually um that you just sort of have a a free I don't know these words but that they call it, but like a I like the word understanding that it doesn't apply any sort of it does to most people, but we Heideggerians have gotten over that.

120
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,560
You're on the right track.

121
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,680
There's a sense in which you and the world are so adapted to each other.

122
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:46,921
At this basic level of familiarity, that's got to do with this ecstatical structure of Dasein, which has horizonal structure too.

123
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,881
We'll get back to that in a minute.

124
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:58,841
The ecstatical structure has to do with the way Dasein is open and adapted to the world.

125
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:04,281
And the horizonal structure has to do with the way the world is adapted to Dasein.

126
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,641
And there's no distinction.

127
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:08,441
I mean, they're just sort of two sides of the same coin.

128
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:17,881
But that's the nearest thing to subject-object distinction when you, at the most primordial level, is that there are ecstasies and there are horizons.

129
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:37,960
But it's supposed to be not like the subject-object level, since somehow the ecstasies have horizons and the horizons have ecstasies, meaning that the Dasein has this threefold temporalizing structure and the world has some other uh aspect of the threefold temporalizing structure and they can't be taken apart.

130
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,400
They can't, they don't make any sense apart from each other.

131
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,680
Now, why was I saying that?

132
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:45,641
Oh, just because we're talking about understanding.

133
00:16:45,641 --> 00:17:08,400
And you made me think, I mean, you you realize that from way back, again, I bet I can't turn to it, that familiarity, which never gets thematized much in Division I and nor in Division II, goes to make up the understanding of being, that quote I like to quote from, so we're very near the basic phenomenon when you're talking about familiarity.

134
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:17,121
That's why I think that it might well be sort of a way of talking about the phenomena that he wants to talk about.

135
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:20,960
Remember again, I just keep, what is the phenomenon he wants to talk about?

136
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:30,881
It's that on the basis of which beings are understood, and that's called temporality temporalizing itself.

137
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:35,680
It's not going to look very much like any kind of time.

138
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:42,800
It's not clock time, it's not world time with its earlier and later, and now it's time for a lecture kind of time.

139
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:47,760
It's not certainly not physical, one moment after another time.

140
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,040
It's not even successive kind of time.

141
00:17:51,521 --> 00:18:15,440
But it has three-dimensional structure, and from that, and because that structure, I guess, is richer than any other structure, you get to call that, and makes all forms of time possible.

142
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,240
You get to call that originary temporality.

143
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,960
And that's what we're trying to understand, what it is, and how we're supposed to be able to talk about it.

144
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:43,280
I like this because it looks like that beginning of understanding is talking about this kind of primary understanding, and the kind of primary understanding is going to be this background hoping kind of understanding, I think.

145
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:51,801
And clearly, it's more basic even than anticipatory resoluteness.

146
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:54,361
I have something on 385 that says that.

147
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,240
The second paragraph.

148
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:09,240
If the term understanding is taken in a way which is primordially existential, it means to be projecting toward an ability to be for the sake of which Dasein exists.

149
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,560
In understanding one's own ability to be is disclosed and so forth.

150
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:28,121
And that's, I guess, the primordial existential understanding is, what is, is that authentic temporality temporal?

151
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:39,080
I mean, is that temporality temporalizing itself, or just temporality temporalizing itself when it is originary existential?

152
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:40,281
No, I think that is.

153
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:45,641
That's one version of the way temporality temporalizes itself.

154
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:46,280
That's only one.

155
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:47,321
That's understanding.

156
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:53,000
But they're all going to be aspects of the background coping thing.

157
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:01,000
If somebody wants me, I would be delighted, because I tell you, I think this is very important to understand this very, very difficult book.

158
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:08,361
And I think we've got to understand what primordial temporality is, or temporality temporalizing itself, or you won't understand anything else.

159
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:16,841
I mean, it's easy relative to that to understand authentic Dasein and resoluteness and anticipatory resoluteness and everything like that.

160
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,800
That's childplay compared to this.

161
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:27,080
And we don't even understand when we're doing this, and that's where Bill and I are differing, what the job is supposed to be.

162
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:38,160
And so let's, and at least I think I understand in a way that I'm not sure Bill does, although I hadn't time to read more than the relevant chapter we read.

163
00:20:38,641 --> 00:21:01,040
But I mean, I'm not sure that Bill understands that the whole goal of this is to get a structure which covers both the world and Dasein such that you can see that it's the same structure from two points of view and capture both the capture the fact that Dasein is its world existingly.

164
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,520
That's the job, I think.

165
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,560
Now, I saw a hand.

166
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:05,201
Yeah, you.

167
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,841
Yeah.

168
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,121
Oh, good, good.

169
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:07,761
You see?

170
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,160
How many didn't know?

171
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,400
I mean, it's my fault that I'm nice.

172
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,920
Somebody should speak up.

173
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,121
It's the same.

174
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:27,040
It's just too, the word is Ursprunglisch, and it gets translated primordial in ours, and Blatner wants to translate it originary.

175
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,441
Now, I don't remember.

176
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,281
I didn't rem I haven't any core with Bill about that.

177
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:49,920
It isn't as if, I think, although I'm ready to think out loud and entertain it, is it somehow sort of prejudicing things in the direction of my trying to read it my way to call it primordial and his way to call it originary?

178
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:51,841
I think it is.

179
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:52,641
I think it is.

180
00:21:52,641 --> 00:22:03,040
He's already built into it that it's some, he understands the source as if in some kind of idealist way is built into it already.

181
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:10,240
The ordinary kinds of time arise from this.

182
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,960
And I want to say, no, it's primordial.

183
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,680
It isn't the o origin of these other modes of time.

184
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:20,441
It's more basic than all these other modes of time.

185
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:26,760
And they presuppose it and act on the basis of it.

186
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,041
But I don't think that's, I think that's it's misleading to call that originary.

187
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,920
I don't is there any do you have any feel for the German?

188
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,361
That's true.

189
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:43,320
And in the Ursprung des Kunstweck, which Heidegger wrote later, that gets translated, the origin of the work of R.

190
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:43,961
Right.

191
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,400
But I hmm.

192
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,000
You're right.

193
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,601
Still, I'm ready to just sort of take it.

194
00:22:54,841 --> 00:23:03,960
If we could, if I could hear in a neutral way, originary meaning basic, then I wouldn't mind calling it originary.

195
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:12,121
Primordial is such a non-illuminating word that you just have to bring in from English if you try to do Urspring.

196
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:18,920
So let's, and so that's why I lapse into saying originary, because it feels like a real, somehow it's saying something.

197
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:26,280
However, when I worry about what it's saying, which Eugene just did, it sounds like it's saying something that I don't see any ground in the text.

198
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,000
I mean, I see that all these modes of time arise from that.

199
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,001
Now you have to go back to 383.

200
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,720
That's why I started with 383.

201
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:46,440
Arising from being to be somehow degenerating from, I still don't understand that.

202
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,841
Let's go back and look again in the light of this discussion.

203
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:56,280
The ontological structure of Dasein's being is not inferior to what springs from it.

204
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:05,121
Now, the ontological structure of Dasein's being is what, temporality, temporalizing self, I presume, is not inferior to what springs from it.

205
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:08,240
The power is above it in power from the outset.

206
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:13,440
In the field of ontology, any springing from is degeneration.

207
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:19,361
And what is what is this on my side or on Bill's side?

208
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:24,720
The idea that in ontology, springing from is degeneration?

209
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,601
I don't get it.

210
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,361
Let's not go back to this.

211
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:30,560
But let's stick to the question.

212
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:36,400
All I want to say that you, you did the right thing to ask, and we have to make up our mind.

213
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:45,361
And I think originary, I agree with Eugene, originary is closer to the German, even if it's further from what I want to say.

214
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,361
Yeah, you want to say more?

215
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:50,721
While you're doing that, just a second, I want to look at this and see.

216
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,281
Look at that.

217
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,240
It seems to be recording.

218
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,641
Go ahead.

219
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,721
Let me say a word about that.

220
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,960
And keep that, bear that in mind.

221
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,801
I mean, if you look at Blattner, by the way, Blattner is the only good book on this subject, as far as I know, and it's a very good book on the subject.

222
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:14,560
That is this book, Dasein's Heidegger's Temporal Idealism.

223
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:18,400
And that's why it's worth reading it and sort of dialoguing with it.

224
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:28,641
But Blattner thinks that Heidegger's trying to derive nature time from Dasein time and fails.

225
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:42,800
You're saying, no, there's a success from time in nature, and that's just basic, and it's going to be there and it and in and it it's independent of Dasein and what goes on whether Dasein ever exists or not.

226
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:53,481
And uh Heidegger, as far as I know, again, keep your eyes open, I don't think Heidegger ever says anything about successive time, oddly enough.

227
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:02,440
He says that the the Dasein structure, the the of tem temporality, is not successive.

228
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:11,320
And he says that from temporality he's able to derive a whole lot of the features of everyday time.

229
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:21,560
And he certainly explains how because of clocks we begin to think of time as a succession of pure meaningless nous.

230
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:27,320
And he he can he can derive sort of our access to that.

231
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:32,760
But Bill thinks he wants to derive that there are pure meaningless nows.

232
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,720
And I think and he failed, Bill said.

233
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:39,400
I think he doesn't fail because he doesn't even try.

234
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:47,160
But then why doesn't he tell us that he's assuming that of course there is a sequence of natural nows?

235
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,480
I don't know.

236
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,641
I mean, what I what I really think is he thinks it's obvious.

237
00:26:53,641 --> 00:27:03,960
I think he he thinks it's obvious that Descartes space is basic for science, but doesn't get at our spatiality.

238
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,720
I think he thinks that natural succession is basic too and doesn't get at our kind of temporality.

239
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,721
But you can't just say what you just said.

240
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:25,720
I mean, or you can, but you're outside of this whole debate, because Heidegger certainly if if that's what Heidegger's doing, then we've got to find some reason to think so.

241
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,320
That meaning assuming natural succession.

242
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:33,841
I think there are reasons to think that Heidegger is assuming natural succession.

243
00:27:33,321 --> 00:27:35,121
I think I mentioned this before.

244
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:45,601
My favorite quote at the very last paragraph of the history of the concept of time, Heidegger talks about the time-free movements of nature.

245
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:50,081
And whatever that is, I think that's like Cartesian space.

246
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:52,240
I think he thinks that's just there.

247
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,040
And he doesn't feel he has to explain it.

248
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:58,240
But you can't just start out with that.

249
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,801
If you start out with that, you're going to get in trouble.

250
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:16,641
You have to realize that Heidegger's, you've got to try to figure out how Heidegger could be holding on to a natural succession and why he isn't telling us.

251
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:17,121
Yeah.

252
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,281
I don't see if he needs to hold on to a natural succession.

253
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:23,040
I mean, it's very, very natural.

254
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:24,320
Yeah, right.

255
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:29,680
Just to provide an infrastructure, and maybe suggest why he might not want to mention it at all.

256
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm reminded why I was reminded in my first of it of a quote from Wittgenstein's Broadbottle Investigation, where he mentions, just in a small quote, we like to say that animals don't talk because they don't think, but really they just don't talk.

257
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:52,800
And I'm reminded of this in so far as I want to figure it out and say, we like to say that things get older because time passes, but really they just get older.

258
00:28:52,801 --> 00:29:00,400
And there's a sense that we sort of assert succession onto nature, and things do get older and they change.

259
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,680
But succession itself, as we consider a slot time, isn't implied by that.

260
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,560
And we don't need to even talk about succession necessarily.

261
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:13,680
Well, that's going to be an issue for either next time or the time after.

262
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,440
But let's not talk about it yet.

263
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,961
I just want to say one thing about it to keep your eyes open for it.

264
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:26,281
Just keep your eyes open and see what you think.

265
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:48,040
A very smart undergraduate wrote a very good honors thesis about three years ago now, claiming that Heidegger makes a clear distinction between earlier and later, which are relative to now, and now is something we bring in to time, just like here is something we bring into space.

266
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:59,561
But that there's something more neutral than earlier and later, which is before and after, which we can try to describe without bringing in a now.

267
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,240
And that would be nature time.

268
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:20,041
Heidegger's got a whole thing, and this is what this brilliant student found in the the Sophist lectures about how Aristotle is confused in his definition of time as to whether it's got an earlier and later or only a before and after.

269
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:31,801
And that sounds very mysterious unless you keep asking yourself whether the now depends on us and whether when you could have a kind of succession without it.

270
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:35,240
So that's all to be put aside.

271
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,081
First, you in the back, then, okay, you yeah.

272
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,161
Wait on 379.

273
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,200
Where are you?

274
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:42,920
Okay.

275
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,960
Yes, I think yeah, that's an interesting quote.

276
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:57,321
He does think, it seems, that that any any but but of course anybody in their right mind thinks that time goes on after they die.

277
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,520
I mean, Kant too, and s and Bill too.

278
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:15,280
So the question is whether time is sort of constituted by us as going on you know as a kind of I don't know I I can't even think about it.

279
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:29,200
I have the inauthentic temporality, rather uh find authentic temporality, than how the authentic temporality has been authentic.

280
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,920
Temporalizing infinite time out of the finite.

281
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,240
So I mean that's a good point.

282
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,121
Good point.

283
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:38,400
Yeah, Tyler.

284
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:50,721
Based on our final deaths, time go on after we work, time goes on, and finitely.

285
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:00,000
Everyday organized mind got long and things quite different from each other.

286
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:01,200
Hmm.

287
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:05,200
Clocks go on and calendars go on.

288
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:29,520
And that's well, that's that sounds right to me only because if he were really making this strong claim, it sounds like it, I grant you, if he were really making the strong claim that uh time that in every sense of time, even just brute succession, depends on us in some way, uh that seems strange.

289
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:41,280
But on the other hand, if he said if he seems to make the claim that uh time uh doesn't depend on us at all, he needs to g explain it more.

290
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,761
But but I but uh but this is for next time.

291
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,641
We are gotten off into exactly what we're not supposed to be talking about.

292
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:48,240
You want to say something, Henry?

293
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,641
Yeah.

294
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:55,160
Well, well, everybody, I don't mind talking about it, because when you read it, there at least be clued into what what about succession, yeah?

295
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,400
Where are you?

296
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,760
On what page?

297
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,881
Okay.

298
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,200
Where now?

299
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:04,520
Well I don't see where you are yet.

300
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:06,440
Right, above or below?

301
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,121
Okay.

302
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,160
Temporal well, go ahead then.

303
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:16,361
So what do you conclude about that from that?

304
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:18,520
Temporality, temporalizing.

305
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:29,641
But the question is, I think the problem is there is a kind of sequence of now's temporality, all right.

306
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,121
He's not going to deny that.

307
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:43,561
The question is whether that is dependent on Daseine in some way, explained in terms of Dasein, or whether that's in nature independent of Dasein.

308
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:48,281
And the question, another way to put it, is on this word accessible.

309
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:59,081
What is characteristic of time, which is accessible to ordinary understanding, is precisely the fact that it's a pure sequence of now's without beginning and end and so forth.

310
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:01,641
That is, well, I never mind accessible.

311
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:05,561
In which the ecstatical character of primordial time has been leveled off.

312
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,160
Well, I don't know how important accessible is.

313
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:30,361
I mean, it's clear that the the sequence of nows is accessible to us only by way of leaving out all of the richness of temporality, temporalizing itself, and then all you get left, finally, is a sequence of pure nows.

314
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,200
Now, there's there's so many things to worry about there.

315
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:38,961
Is it the pure nows in nature that then we get access to when we leave all this out?

316
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:40,081
I think not.

317
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,761
I think now itself is a Daseine relative notion.

318
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,801
And remember, to me anyway, it helps a great deal to keep reminding yourself about space.

319
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,160
If you get rid of Dasein, there is no here.

320
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:00,720
But there's still up and down, or at least there are three dimensions, equal and so forth.

321
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:05,680
Whatever Descartes, there's still res extensa, but there's no now.

322
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:25,921
And I think, so to understand it in terms of a series of nows, you could only get there by having this rich notion and getting it more and more degenerated, to talk by that first quote, more and more privative, until all that's left is a succession of now's.

323
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:29,761
I think Heidegger thinks that that depends on us.

324
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:35,200
Not only the intelligibility of it, but the access to it.

325
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,160
You look worried.

326
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,320
But I don't think that nature time depends on us, because I think nature time has no now's.

327
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:48,961
Now, I have no idea how you're supposed to think about a time that has no nows, any more than I understand how you should think about the time-free movements of nature.

328
00:35:48,961 --> 00:36:06,321
But I want to say Heidegger thinks, seems to think, that there is a way to think about nature that would strip away the now and the earlier and the later and leave a kind of pure succession that didn't even have a now, than but I don't know.

329
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,081
And uh it's funny how we're doing, why we're doing next time instead of this time.

330
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:13,200
Probably because I can understand a little of next time and nothing of this time.

331
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,481
Yeah, Stephen.

332
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:16,721
Wait, so talk loud, I can't hear you.

333
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,840
Well, yeah, I I I think I'm agreeing with you.

334
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:39,561
Are you a a pure sequence of nows is what you get from from within Dasein's rich temporality temporalizing itself experience in which there's pragmatic time, then there's clock time, then there's sequence of now time.

335
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:45,081
All that is somehow relative to Dasein, I think.

336
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:52,041
And that's what you call present Dasman time, which I think that's right.

337
00:36:52,041 --> 00:37:02,921
And the question is whether there's a kind of succession, even more basic, which hasn't got any nows.

338
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:13,561
That's what he entertains in that discussion of Aristotle when he says that Aristotle mixes up the earlier and later, which you have to have a now.

339
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,001
You can't have earlier than now without a now or later without a now.

340
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:23,081
But you can have before and after without a now in some sense.

341
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:27,160
The number series has, I mean, three is after one and so forth.

342
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:41,721
And nature is going to be in some way laid out in such a way that there being a now in it doesn't doesn't make any difference, doesn't show up, doesn't count.

343
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:50,441
And again, just as you can lay out space, nobody thinks it's crazy to think that there's a space in which there isn't any here.

344
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:57,641
So, why should it be, why shouldn't we at least try to think of a temporality in which there isn't any now?

345
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:59,320
You're looking worried.

346
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah, no.

347
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:04,561
Okay, but I'm worried because I want to go back to this, okay?

348
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,520
So, here we go.

349
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:18,561
I have tried so hard to lay out the difference between what I'm saying and what Bill is saying, so that you can try to decide for yourself and for me which one is the right way to look at it.

350
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:21,200
So, I got to 385.

351
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:28,721
I say the existential condition of the possibility of intentionality is more basic even than anticipatory resoluteness.

352
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,240
That's an interesting claim.

353
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,761
Where do I get that?

354
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:38,321
You got that out of 385, the second full paragraph.

355
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:48,321
If the term understanding is taken in a way which is primordial existential, it means to be projecting toward an ability to be, what I read before, for the sake of which any design exists.

356
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,321
You know, understanding one's own ability to be, dash on knows what it's capable of.

357
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:01,521
It knows, however, not by having discovered some fact but maintaining itself in an existential possibility.

358
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,081
Why am I, what in the world?

359
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:13,361
When I doesn't say anything yet about existential condition of the possibility is more basic than anticipatory resoluteness, let's go on a little.

360
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:22,561
The kind of ignorance which corresponds to this does not consist in the absence of understanding, it must be regarded as a deficient mode of the projectiveness.

361
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,720
Existence can be when one understands.

362
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:28,481
Well, if it says what I just said, it said, I don't see it now.

363
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:35,761
I said the existential condition of the possibility of intentionality is more basic than anticipatory resoluteness.

364
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,520
That's a pretty clear claim.

365
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:39,121
Why don't I see it?

366
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:41,680
Well, I'm going to put a question mark there.

367
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,880
If I figure out what I meant by it, I'll tell you next time if it's important.

368
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,321
It probably isn't.

369
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:53,241
So all explanation is rooted in Dasein's primary understanding on 385.

370
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,441
We just read that one.

371
00:39:56,441 --> 00:40:07,720
And now I'm wondering: if there is such a thing as a non-successive structure of background coping, what would it be like to understand it?

372
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:17,880
And now I'm trying to figure out, sort of, one, whether that's what we should be trying to understand, and if so, whether Bill's notion of explaining it is going to help any.

373
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,521
I'm on one.

374
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:29,881
He finds this long quote about time in Heidegger's logic book, which is written a year before being, lectures given a year before being in time.

375
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,281
And he says at the bottom of his 105, that is Blattner's.

376
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:42,521
In Logic, his book, Logic, Heidegger gives us an indication that he has something radical up his sleeve, but he does not say just what.

377
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:53,641
And then he quotes, already and ahead, the already and ahead that help to make up care as temporal characteristics do not concern an entity that takes place in time.

378
00:40:53,961 --> 00:41:02,680
And then skipping down, because you heard that, I'm going to read the last part of it, because it gets darker and darker and harder.

379
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:09,160
It looks like Heidegger sees that he's got something to talk about that he can't understand, how to talk about it.

380
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,840
Care is not only not temporally determined in the manner stated, that is, how.

381
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,440
I don't know, but care is not, I don't like to turn the man, but rather cannot be temporally determined at all.

382
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,441
Oh, of course, care isn't in time.

383
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,241
Care is that's the non-successive story.

384
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,920
But already and ahead are temporal characteristics, exclamation mark.

385
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:41,840
Thus, the only remaining possibility is that their time-locked sense is not the sense thus far explained, but a different one.

386
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,001
But what other sense?

387
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:52,401
I mean, so the the kind already explained is all the kinds of temporality that you have when you're involved with things.

388
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:56,480
And now he's asking what about the background temporality, as I read it.

389
00:41:56,481 --> 00:42:01,360
And then he says, this, namely, what is this more basic temporality?

390
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:07,121
This is primarily dark, and we stand once again at the beginning of our considerations.

391
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:24,241
Nonetheless, we have one, if not something positive, then at least prohibitively, something essential, namely the reference to the idea that if the already and the ahead are temporal phenomena, the most natural interpretation as now time does not help us.

392
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:36,321
So I'm reading that because it looks like when he gets to the most basic time-like character, he says he can't explain it.

393
00:42:36,320 --> 00:43:10,081
And that's when I want to say that I think if that's true, that there's a kind of basic coping phenomenon finding their way around in the world, which is an understanding of being and holistic, but not intentional, then if there is such a thing, and if Heidegger doesn't know how to talk about it, and he never does talk about it, except to say there is such a thing, but he can't describe it, then I would say authentic temporality is the best you can do.

394
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:23,240
And because it gives us uh the you see in authentic temporality an instance of the unity of originary or primordial, you can have it either way, time.

395
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:31,561
We can make sense of the unity of primordial temporality because we can make sense of the unity of an authentic life.

396
00:43:31,561 --> 00:43:33,961
I think that's that's good.

397
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:52,361
And that's why I think that he spends all this time in Division II talking about temporality temporalizing itself as primordial and authentic, is all he can talk about is the authentic structure of time temporalizing itself and its unity.

398
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:19,720
When he does talk finally about this more basic on the basis of which of everything, being in being, that on the basis of which everything is intelligible, when he does finally talk about it, he says these very, very unhelpful things about ecstatical unities and horizonal unities and the way they are connected or sort of aspects of the same something or other.

399
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:32,281
That's an attempt, that's notice, that's an attempt to talk about something very general about time, not just authentic, the temporality of authentic Dasein, but the temporality of everything.

400
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:49,880
The temporality of being in the world, the temporality of the clearing, the temporality of whatever, all these words that he's got for the disclosive openness that is most basically us.

401
00:44:50,481 --> 00:45:05,521
We we aren't we aren't the totality of things existingly, but we are somehow the clearing or opening in which we can encounter ourselves and other Daseins and the totality of things.

402
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:08,480
And that that that's what he wants to talk about.

403
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:10,641
That's really what he always wants to talk about.

404
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:26,881
The basic ontological difference, as he calls it, is the difference between that opening in which beings become intelligible and every sort of being and every kind of intelligibility, I think.

405
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,561
So let me go on.

406
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:33,121
We're going to describe the unity of the basic openness.

407
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:42,721
And if he is, then that's not going to look like an explanation in Blatiner terms.

408
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:49,120
It's not going to make it's not something, there's going to be no in terms of which.

409
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:52,240
There's going to be a description of a phenomenon.

410
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,521
And what you get is, I'll read the strange stuff that you get when he does it.

411
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:03,281
I was already reading it, but now we've got to repay attention to how it fits in.

412
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:11,041
At the top of 377, all of this really important stuff happens there on 377.

413
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,361
Temporality is not an entity.

414
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,321
It is not, but it temporalizes itself.

415
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,081
Nevertheless, we cannot avoid saying temporality is.

416
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:27,761
And so we switch to saying temporality temporalizes, and indeed it temporalizes possible ways of itself.

417
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:36,001
These make possible the multiplicity of Dasein's modes of being, and especially the basic possibility of authentic and inauthentic existence.

418
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:39,680
But they're just instances of all the stuff.

419
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:49,001
But that is, again, keep remembering, it's so close to we're talking about being as that on the basis of which beings are understood, all sorts of beings.

420
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,720
Now let's go on.

421
00:46:49,961 --> 00:47:01,160
The future, the character of having been and the present show the phenomenological characteristic, the phenomenal characteristics of the towards oneself, of the back to and the letting oneself be encountered by.

422
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:12,921
The phenomenon of towards, to, and omit make temporality manifest as, and now that's the ecstatic con, that's this ecstasy story.

423
00:47:12,921 --> 00:47:17,001
That is, that it's the outside of itself, pure and simple.

424
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:25,081
Temporality is the primordial or originary outside of itself, in and for itself.

425
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:31,561
We therefore call the phenomenon of the future the characteristic of having been in the present the ecstasies of temporality.

426
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:35,001
Temporality is not prior to this, is not.

427
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:38,680
Prior to this, an entity which first emerges from itself.

428
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:46,281
Its essence is, never mind a process of, is temporalizing in the unity of the ecstasies.

429
00:47:46,921 --> 00:48:00,360
That's what I think is evidence that whatever this primordial temporality is interested in, it's what opens up a space in which anything can show up at all, as anything.

430
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,721
I want to read, I've read what I let's see, I've read that.

431
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:04,841
Yeah.

432
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,481
Okay.

433
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:12,200
It and I say on 401, he gets as near as he ever gets to anything.

434
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:14,200
What we want to say.

435
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,881
Let's see what that is.

436
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:23,401
Yeah, yeah, that's where he's got he puts it together at the middle, right where the italics is.

437
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:36,241
Thus, we can see that in every ecstasis, temporality temporalizes itself as a whole, and this means that the ecstatical unity with which temporality has fully temporalized itself currently is grounded.

438
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,840
You see, where I'm on.

439
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:45,281
That in the ecstatical unity and so on, so is grounded the totality of the structural whole of existence, facticity, and falling.

440
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,160
That's the unity of the terror structure.

441
00:48:48,481 --> 00:48:52,800
And I haven't got, I'm not reading the thing I want yet.

442
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:57,521
On 402, we ought to now be able to understand being in the world.

443
00:48:57,521 --> 00:49:00,000
That's where he's going to put them together, the new paragraph.

444
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:11,921
Only through the fact that being there is rooted in temporality can we get an insight into the existential possibility of the phenomena, which is at the beginning of our analysis of Dasein, that is, being in the world.

445
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,200
Skipping a little.

446
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:21,200
The question of the basis which makes the unity of this articulate structure possible remained in the background.

447
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,441
So now it's in the foreground.

448
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:28,481
And the basis which makes the unity of this articulate structure possible.

449
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:35,441
Now, that's certainly not authentic Dasein and authentic temporality, because they're intermittent.

450
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:40,880
So Bill and I are both trying to describe what that would be.

451
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,801
And I don't really understand what Bill thinks it is.

452
00:49:47,601 --> 00:49:56,241
Any of you who read, I'm trying to understand what the phenomena is that he's trying to describe with temporality temporalizing itself.

453
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,121
Yes, well, naturally, and so is Bill.

454
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,321
But anyway, go ahead.

455
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,720
I think this was Bill Barton wanted a good job.

456
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,680
Good.

457
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,160
We used to put it on the certain phenomena, both uh the certain part of the knowledge.

458
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,760
You can certainly find a job that you don't want.

459
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,641
That's very helpful, that distinction.

460
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:18,920
But I stick to, you know, my end of it.

461
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:25,880
It looks to me like y if he just stops with what job does it do, he's not got he's not done much.

462
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:36,601
I mean, that he w for instance, I mean, if he just says that it unifies all the modes of time and it gives us and so forth, that's fine.

463
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:40,041
But he seems to be trying to ask, and how does it do that?

464
00:50:40,441 --> 00:50:45,241
What is the phenomenon str the phenomenal structure that enables us to do it?

465
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:55,801
The reason I think he's trying to ask that question, I mean, I think you're right, if he stopped with this is what it does, he'd at least have got somewhere, and that would be nice.

466
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:07,800
But he seems to say, finally, I just haven't got to it yet, that when you really want to talk about it, you finally got to talk about the fact that it's got ecstasies and it's got a horizon.

467
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,720
That doesn't seem to be something it does.

468
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,600
Let's go to that.

469
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:21,561
It seems to be something that enables it to explain the fact that we are the world existingly.

470
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:22,921
We're back to that again.

471
00:51:22,921 --> 00:51:25,321
And he, let's see now.

472
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:28,041
Okay, here we are on 416.

473
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:31,241
Now ask yourself Tyler's question.

474
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:51,241
Is when Heidegger finally gets down to as near as he ever gets to talking about, let's start on 415, the heading of the chapter, the temporal problem of the transcendence of the world, he gets a question at the bottom, how anything like the world in its unity with Dasein is ontologically possible.

475
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,721
Isn't that, doesn't that look like the question about how does it do what it does?

476
00:51:56,001 --> 00:52:04,561
How what sort of thing, I think it looks like the question, what sort of thing does temporality have to be in order for it to do the job that it does?

477
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,081
Yes.

478
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:07,680
Yes.

479
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:09,360
Yes.

480
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:18,720
You can show that in the evening.

481
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:21,920
You can tell us very well how it does it in the beginning of the book.

482
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:24,081
But there'll actually be no non-notes.

483
00:52:24,401 --> 00:52:28,961
Okay, well, in a funny way, I agree, you know, half with you.

484
00:52:28,961 --> 00:52:40,481
There's no phenomena that you can point to or say anything about, but there's the something or other on the basis of which the first two things, so what's the job that needs to be done?

485
00:52:40,481 --> 00:52:46,160
We know that somehow get get Dasein and world together completely.

486
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,081
How what structure enables it to do it?

487
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,280
We know that, it turns out.

488
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,200
I'm just talking about it in a minute.

489
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,041
It's the ecstatic horizonal structure of temporality.

490
00:52:55,041 --> 00:53:02,561
And now we want to know, but we can't say anything about what it is on the basis of which that happens.

491
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:06,561
Now that's where Blattner starts talking about the in terms of which.

492
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:15,441
And I guess that's what you're saying is you could stop with in terms of which if you say uh if you use the words ecstatical and horizonal, those are the terms.

493
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:16,880
Will you see say it once again?

494
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,320
So data and temporality are authentic or inauthentic.

495
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,881
In terms same with um the temporality of waiting well.

496
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,720
The state offers bringing it down and turn that hand in terms of the unity of the resonance speed.

497
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:44,561
Now all I think is saying is they won't have a bounding temperature, either DAVA and so it won't be in terms of which are temporal, assembled structure.

498
00:53:44,561 --> 00:53:46,800
They won't be because it will be the same structure.

499
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,040
It'll be uh in terms of which It'll be you can always keep saying a three-fold structure anyway.

500
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,001
That's the only thing to hold on to.

501
00:53:55,001 --> 00:54:17,721
Yeah, even authentic DASEN has a three-fold structure, coping has a three-fold structure with equipment, and that threefold structure gets traced back and back until you get the three ecstasies somehow link with or have the threefold horizons, and that's how it all fits at the most basic level.

502
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:22,761
And you can do all that, I'm following you, in terms of just the way I did.

503
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:45,160
But it doesn't seem to me sort of this is a book in phenomenology, and I can't help thinking that Heidegger wants to point us to the phenomenon, and there is a phenomenon, namely this familiarity of involved coping, which is always going on and provides the clearing for it all.

504
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,400
But you may be right.

505
00:54:47,401 --> 00:55:06,601
I mean, Bill would turn out to be right if Heidegger isn't even trying to do what I'm asking him to do, but he's satisfied to do that what's the job and what are the sort of equipment that you've got for doing the job and how does it do the job, all at a level of terms.

506
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:13,480
And I want to say, no, no, you've got to do it at the level of phenomena.

507
00:55:13,481 --> 00:55:28,200
Again, remember, the question is partly, is being that on the basis of which being is understood, or is being that, is it a structure in terms of which being is understood, is all constantly in the background.

508
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,561
I wish I could tell.

509
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:44,401
But I think you, you, I think, I like what you're saying in the sense that since I can't give any account of how to describe this familiarity except that it's coping and it's holistic, then maybe I shouldn't even be trying.

510
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:46,000
And maybe he shouldn't be trying.

511
00:55:46,001 --> 00:55:46,240
Yeah.

512
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:54,881
I think that what far down temporality says we shall point to temporality as something called dotlines.

513
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:01,840
Because to be demonstrated, those structures of Godlin, which we shall positionally must be interpreted.

514
00:56:02,561 --> 00:56:24,961
Here at the end, I mean, it seems like I don't know if it has to be a phenomenon that's dated so much as when we really, you know, lay out all in position points going to lay out all of these structures of the guideline and then we'll be able to kind of see the patterns developed where we can where what we're going to do is it's going to be interpreted.

515
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:27,680
You know, it's not necessarily just plain a phenomenon.

516
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,281
So that's more like what Tyler and Bill are saying.

517
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:46,800
I'm asking for something that's that's just not there really am I asking for something that there there isn't any such thing that that on my this on the basis of which phenomena, or am I asking for just something that we can't say anything about and he's not trying?

518
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,480
And Bill is right about that.

519
00:56:49,521 --> 00:57:06,240
In the end, I don't know if if you're all so far apart in a in a way I feel like you're wanting to point to our everyday coping and then wanting to see a phenomenon we point in that phenomenon how in how we in the way that we carry out the the things that show the structures of guidelines.

520
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:30,760
I mean in some ways I think it seems always right to me in the way that you're addressing it in terms of but I think that I think that what Temporality is doing here is taking that and on a fundamental level saying this, you know, this interpreting, if we really interpret structures that are that are functioning there, interpreting these at a deeper, more meaningful level, they come down to.

521
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,840
Okay, I think that's getting closer.

522
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,560
Yeah, yeah.

523
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:42,041
I do think that if it's an interpretive, it's kind of the final interpretation we place on all of the structures where you feel like.

524
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,081
Okay, yeah, yeah.

525
00:57:43,081 --> 00:57:47,641
I think that that's I think that's maybe right.

526
00:57:47,641 --> 00:57:48,360
Let me go on.

527
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,480
But let me see where we are.

528
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:52,921
Yeah, okay, we have time.

529
00:57:52,921 --> 00:57:54,121
So here we are.

530
00:57:55,001 --> 00:58:06,680
We haven't gotten to the place where I want, where I claim that he's really trying to describe the ultimate clearing or something like.

531
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:11,561
It could be, I'm just thinking that we're trying to do justice to both.

532
00:58:11,561 --> 00:58:15,800
That on the basis of which beings are understood is what I keep wanting to find.

533
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,200
That's the ultimate clearing of some sort, the open space.

534
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:34,840
That in terms of which beings, what is it, that which determines beings as beings, that would be the other something structure that Bill is looking for, I suppose.

535
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,200
I think we really, and maybe we're supposed to put them together.

536
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:51,641
We discover that in terms of determines beings as beings, and then we discover that points us to some kind of openness, which is a phenomenon.

537
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:52,040
Maybe.

538
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:53,720
I mean, you're looking puzzled.

539
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:55,481
What I said is puzzling.

540
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:07,840
Yeah, I was hoping to say just say yes, so that he could combine them, that he could do, he could describe that in terms of which all this happens, and he can describe that on the basis of which all this happens.

541
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:17,361
And he may either be trying to do both and not be able to or not know it, or maybe he's really trying to do both and he knows it, and we're supposed to figure it out that he's doing that.

542
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,520
It's really another way to put it: what is it, is this mostly hermeneutic or is this mostly phenomenology?

543
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:25,040
Isn't that the same?

544
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:33,281
I mean, I say it's got to bottom out in a phenomena that he can describe on the basis of which everything else makes is intelligible.

545
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:42,561
And the hermeneutic view would say something like, I guess, it's got to be articulated in terms so that we can see it, make it intelligible.

546
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:53,521
And then one of them is make it intelligible being intelligible and to make it possible.

547
00:59:53,521 --> 01:00:04,801
And the intelligible is the story I keep trying to tell, and the possibility, and that would be some sort of realist way, and that which makes it all possible.

548
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,481
That's Bill's story, I take it.

549
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:08,720
That's the kind of idealism he wants.

550
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,720
Is that or am I missing?

551
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,881
I reversed what you said.

552
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,160
Yeah, two of them.

553
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:14,721
Okay.

554
01:00:15,121 --> 01:00:16,641
I saw a hand over here, yeah.

555
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:24,001
The hermeneutic method has singularly thought somewhere.

556
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:31,920
Is I've ever street that question, like on what there is who's thought positive?

557
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:43,520
Yes, it's funny that he doesn't explain it much, but he talks about, in being in time, he talks about the horizon for understanding being, as if there was a place to stop.

558
01:00:43,521 --> 01:00:55,081
But in Basic Problems, in the part that we'll read during the last three times, he talks about how there's always a broader horizon in terms of which you could be understanding all this.

559
01:00:55,081 --> 01:00:58,280
And I guess that's more than what he should be saying.

560
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:06,281
And given his hermeneutic approach, there's no final horizon that says now we've really got it.

561
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,360
Okay, let me go back.

562
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:13,960
I mean, somehow I keep not finding the passages here that I definitely want to read before I stop.

563
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:15,320
So let me keep looking.

564
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:36,921
I just found the part which I already said, that what he calls transcendence is going to be something that is not transcending from inner to outer, not a structure like that you could say much about or anything about.

565
01:01:37,401 --> 01:01:41,961
But it provides, now I'm now, this is where I've got these things.

566
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:51,801
It's something that is like a space, a clearing on the basis of which all forms of intentionality take place.

567
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:56,361
And then I say, look at page 415 and see what is that where we are.

568
01:01:57,641 --> 01:02:02,121
I've got everything underlined on 415, so I don't know what I'm supposed to be reading.

569
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:08,840
So what the I'm going to start with the italics about five lines down.

570
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:14,280
That inside which Dasein understands itself is there, along with its factical existence.

571
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:25,001
That inside which one primary understanding one primarily understands oneself as Hasein's kind of being, Dasein is its world existingly.

572
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:32,200
And then it goes through this other talk about the there and the clearing.

573
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,561
I forget where the clearing comes in, but it does.

574
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:37,200
We have defined, so I'm going on, we have defined being as care.

575
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:39,200
The ontological meaning of care is temporality.

576
01:02:39,441 --> 01:02:45,200
We've shown the temporality constitutes the disclosedness of the there, and we've shown how it does so.

577
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,801
In the disclosedness of the there, the world is disclosed along with it.

578
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,521
The unity of significance must then likewise be grounded in temporality.

579
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:58,800
And then comes this amazing quick move.

580
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:11,921
The existential temporal condition for the possibility of the world lies in the fact that temporality has an ecstatical has an ecstatical unity, has something like a horizon.

581
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:24,241
And I don't, I mean, it looks like we're trying to understand the world and the there and the openness and in another place what he calls the clearing.

582
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:31,200
And it looks like we're trying to understand also how Dasein is its world existingly.

583
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:46,641
And I just, I mean, if somebody can tell me, maybe Tyler more than anybody, maybe, I don't know, what where he suddenly gets this business of the ecstasies have a horizon and that's very important and it seems to do all the job that hasn't been done.

584
01:03:46,641 --> 01:03:48,000
Do you understand that?

585
01:03:49,521 --> 01:03:50,960
Yeah, let's all let's repeat that.

586
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:53,040
Just because it's very this much is clear.

587
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:58,160
The ecstasies are the whole structure seen from the point of view of Dasein.

588
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,961
It's Dasein that has an ecstatical structure.

589
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:08,240
Being ahead of itself, already in amidst and so forth, that is an ecstatical structure.

590
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:08,641
Okay.

591
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:20,361
And that ecstatical structure is a threefold structure and a unified structure, since each of the three elements brings in, describing any one of the three aspects brings in the other two.

592
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,081
That's all.

593
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:24,121
And that's how it gives unity to the care structure.

594
01:04:24,441 --> 01:04:39,720
I think the issue is if you want to understand temporality, but it doesn't get this whole other, which is not, you didn't give these faces, but rather it'll be described as not unity of these factors.

595
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,720
So there's one place in the horizon.

596
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,320
They're not the medium horizon.

597
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,440
I'll be mine as many.

598
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,721
Okay.

599
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,880
A horizon within which both the most relevant.

600
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,080
Oh, does he?

601
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:54,920
Oh.

602
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:57,401
We'll put that on hold.

603
01:04:57,401 --> 01:05:13,801
We realize that may be temporalitate because it turns out that even though originary temporality, which is what we're talking about, has an ecstatical structure from the side of Dasein and has a horizonal structure from the side of coping.

604
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:24,680
So just as there's always a towards which on the side of Dasein, which is a for the sake of which, there's a towards which on the side of coping that has also got a for the sake of which.

605
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,641
And they're different for the sake of which is, and yet they're the same.

606
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:47,961
Because the for the sake of which, say, being a professor is on the side of the ecstatic, but the but the for the sake of which, when you consider not my stand on my being, but the role I've got, that's also futural, and that's on the side of the world.

607
01:05:48,840 --> 01:06:00,921
My stand on my being is ecstatical, but the but the role and the equipment that I am sort of defined in terms of is horizonal.

608
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,921
That's good.

609
01:06:05,121 --> 01:06:21,841
And that's the sense, the sense in which you can't define being a professor either as a subjective thing alone, or a coping in the world thing alone, but that they're really two sides of the same phenomenon or something.

610
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,480
That's good.

611
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:24,081
That helps.

612
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:26,641
But where is this other use of horizon?

613
01:06:26,641 --> 01:06:27,360
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

614
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,320
I started to explain it.

615
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,001
I don't know where it is in here.

616
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:40,321
But in being in basic in basic problems, he comes to a more fundamental kind of temporality than ecstatical or horizonal.

617
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:51,680
Namely, we've got a new word for it, temporalitate, and that's supposed to do something more to explain, as you say, the way the two come together or why they come together or how they come together.

618
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,881
I don't know why.

619
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,601
But yes.

620
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:55,041
But I d that's not in here, is it?

621
01:06:58,561 --> 01:06:59,200
No, he doesn't.

622
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,680
Yeah, it's already directly important.

623
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:06,960
Okay, well, let's hope not, or at least let's try not to think about it yet.

624
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:14,320
In the horizon of horizontal means what that is supposed to be, but temporalized within a horizon.

625
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:20,721
Does he say they temporalize within a horizon?

626
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:21,920
Did I?

627
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:23,921
Well, let me look again.

628
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:38,240
The ecstatical temporal condition of the possibility of the world lies in the fact that temporality as an ecstatical unity has something like a horizon.

629
01:07:38,241 --> 01:07:43,120
Not exactly within it, I think, but just correlated with it.

630
01:07:44,561 --> 01:08:02,200
But the other side, temporal the horizonal schema is the threefold something or other on the side of the world, which corresponds to the threefold ecstatical structure on the side of Dasein.

631
01:08:02,361 --> 01:08:03,720
Are we agreeing about that?

632
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:07,080
What I just read, did that get you to where you are?

633
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:07,720
Let's see.

634
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,440
Let's go back to 413, 415.

635
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,040
No, 416.

636
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,680
We've defined being as care and so forth.

637
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:25,000
It's shown that the temporality consists in the world and the disclosedness of the there, and the world is disclosed with it.

638
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,400
The unity of significance, the ontological constitution of the world must be grounded in temporality.

639
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:45,080
The existential temporal condition for the possibility of the world lies in the fact that temporality as an ecstatical unity has something like a horizon.

640
01:08:46,361 --> 01:09:03,000
That just says, I think, what I just said, something like that the for the sake of which is both the future aspect of Dasein and the future aspect of the world.

641
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,200
And they have to mesh.

642
01:09:04,201 --> 01:09:05,561
Does it say more than that?

643
01:09:06,201 --> 01:09:11,240
Remember, what we're trying to get is that amazing sentence at the end of the previous paragraph.

644
01:09:11,241 --> 01:09:14,601
Dasein is its world existingly.

645
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:23,641
That's supposed to be both giving you the sort of nearest thing to the subject-object distinction and taking it back, so to speak.

646
01:09:23,641 --> 01:09:28,200
There is no way that Dasein and the world can be separated.

647
01:09:28,201 --> 01:09:37,760
The temporalizing itself has the foo-aspect structure, which is Dasein being in the world.

648
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,440
And this is what he wants to explain now.

649
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:45,361
Let's see if I can get any clearer or find another quote.

650
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:47,760
Let's look at the bottom paragraph, first sentence.

651
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:54,561
The unity of the horizonal schema, future, present, and having been is grounded in the ecstatical unity of temporality.

652
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:13,680
The horizon of temporality as a whole determines the whereupon, there's the war of orafin again, so determines that on the basis of which factical existing entities are essentially disclosed.

653
01:10:16,401 --> 01:10:22,400
That's the only basis of which, which I think of as the familiarity that doesn't say that.

654
01:10:24,241 --> 01:10:27,200
Does that help any settle this?

655
01:10:27,201 --> 01:10:28,160
Let me go on.

656
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:45,281
With one's factical being their ability to there, the ability, the ability to be is in each case projected in the horizon of the future, when it's being already disclosed in the horizon of having been, and that which Mr.

657
01:10:45,361 --> 01:10:48,800
Horn says discovered in the horizon of the present.

658
01:10:48,800 --> 01:11:00,960
The horizonal unity of the schemata of these ex-dioceses make possible the primordial way in which the relationships of the inorder two are connected with the for the sake of.

659
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:02,481
Is that helping any?

660
01:11:02,481 --> 01:11:03,601
I don't know.

661
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,280
Not not much.

662
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,120
You, yeah.

663
01:11:07,441 --> 01:11:07,920
Yeah.

664
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,760
Is the German going to cast a light on it?

665
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,080
No.

666
01:11:16,281 --> 01:11:21,641
Just be uh one world for each Dasein, and then you can tell it's them.

667
01:11:21,641 --> 01:11:23,561
Or there can only be one diameter.

668
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,800
Okay, I got a story about that.

669
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,800
I mean, I that used to worry me.

670
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:34,680
And I used to think that Dasein was the world existingly, which is the which is the Hegel side.

671
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,320
Only in Heidegger it would be Dasmann side.

672
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:45,160
That the and then I but I used to think, but he says, to my amazement, that Dasein is its world existingly.

673
01:11:45,161 --> 01:11:53,400
And then I decided that the way to think about it is that Dasein is a perspective on a shared world.

674
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:58,840
That to be a there is to be is to have, you know, just that.

675
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:15,641
Not a projection like in Renaissance painting, but that every Dasein has a world which is the same world but colored differently by, could be colored differently by its moods and by its per per horizon perspective.

676
01:12:15,641 --> 01:12:20,760
Wouldn't that you're not you're not saying anywhere that Dasein exists?

677
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,280
Ah, okay.

678
01:12:22,281 --> 01:12:30,601
I I marked the place where he seemed to have done it the other way too, and that's not maybe not going to help because we ought to get it together.

679
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:44,920
At the bottom, at the top of 417, we've got, let me try starting at the bottom of 4.16, the horizonal unity and so forth and so forth.

680
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:58,521
This implies that on the basis of the horizonal constitution of the ecstatical unity of temporality, there belongs to that entity, which is in each case its own there, something like a world that has been disclosed.

681
01:12:58,521 --> 01:13:02,441
He's got the it's and the and the a together in a sentence.

682
01:13:02,441 --> 01:13:05,361
Does that solve it, or does that just sort of finesse it?

683
01:13:05,601 --> 01:13:06,561
I don't know.

684
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:11,120
Noel, it's own there, something like a world.

685
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,960
I see, he doesn't say the world.

686
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,441
Now, I really wanted him to say Dasein is the world existingly.

687
01:13:17,441 --> 01:13:20,561
It seems to me, doesn't it to you, that that's what he should say?

688
01:13:20,561 --> 01:13:22,960
We're all open on one world.

689
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,441
I mean, he better not think that my world is prior to the world.

690
01:13:27,441 --> 01:13:30,240
That will get him into Useral and Sartre right off.

691
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,960
Well, no, because I am the world from my perspective, and you are the world from your perspective.

692
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:40,320
So it isn't just that we are the world.

693
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:44,800
We are each of us is our take on the world.

694
01:13:45,441 --> 01:13:46,561
That's got to be right.

695
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,280
So we're not the world because we're only our take on the world.

696
01:13:51,521 --> 01:14:00,800
But we are the world in the sense that it's like that when you see the front of the house, you see the whole house.

697
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:09,680
Just because you see it from a point of view doesn't mean that it isn't the same house for everybody.

698
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,040
Is that a big difference?

699
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:11,760
Let me think about it.

700
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,680
Wait a second, I have to think about that.

701
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,760
Now you are the house.

702
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,160
That's a problem.

703
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:19,601
I see what you mean.

704
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,361
Well, how are we supposed to save him?

705
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,960
You want to help him out?

706
01:14:23,281 --> 01:14:26,160
I think that's supposed to be sort of out of that problem.

707
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:32,641
Other conditions of existence is what they know throughout the evening time.

708
01:14:32,641 --> 01:14:42,241
But that your worlds, although experienced fairly differently, are often necessarily unified through a unity.

709
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:56,680
Like, like the sense at the bottom of word 416, I feel horizontal, but the right unity of the common document, they talk of a primordial way in which the relationship in order to be more connected towards Vega.

710
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:12,680
There's always a danger that even with our care structure that could articulate it, that the way Dothai appears to the world through authentic and inauthentic ways of being is separate.

711
01:15:13,161 --> 01:15:14,920
And that's what you've got to get rid of that.

712
01:15:16,521 --> 01:15:21,160
That Dafi and the world were always none several, I guess.

713
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,120
Let me try something, maybe the same and maybe not.

714
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:51,240
I think what he wants to say is the world isn't the world is something that you can be from a perspective because the world is a clearing in which things can show up, and there is just one clearing.

715
01:15:51,401 --> 01:16:03,080
But when you are it, I think maybe what you're saying, when you are it existingly, then you aren't really it in the sense that you're like the so let me read something here on 416.

716
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,241
Right after that, I think maybe I read it, but if I did, I won't hurt it.

717
01:16:07,241 --> 01:16:08,920
If I did, I'll read it again.

718
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:13,561
Right after Dasein is its world existingly, we have defined Dasein's being as care.

719
01:16:13,561 --> 01:16:15,800
The ontological meaning of care is temporality.

720
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:20,120
We've shown that temporality constitutes the disclosedness of the there.

721
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:26,840
See, that's, since that seems to be like the world, it isn't your there and my there.

722
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,880
The disclosing of the there, and we've shown how it is so.

723
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:34,080
In the disclosedness of the there, the world is disclosed along with it.

724
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:40,481
The unity of significance, that is the ontological constitution of the world, must then likewise be grounded in temporality.

725
01:16:41,521 --> 01:16:42,641
Have we got anywhere?

726
01:16:42,641 --> 01:17:02,000
I mean, he doesn't, he does, he seems to be wanting to say that each Dasein discloses the world, and that that's compatible with saying each Dasein discloses its world existingly.

727
01:17:02,241 --> 01:17:03,601
I'm just stating your problem.

728
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,080
It's right there within those few sentences on 416.

729
01:17:08,401 --> 01:17:12,800
And then he seems, and it's, I want everybody to pay attention and think about this.

730
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:19,200
I mean, that is, I bet, I mean, the final problem that this whole thing is trying to get settled.

731
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:43,521
How in the world are you going to get Dasein, which seems to be us and once upon a time, consciousness and mental representations, all of which he denies, together with the world in a way that doesn't turn it into monadic idealism like Husserl, which he certainly doesn't want to do, like Sartre, where somehow you have to get from my world to the world.

732
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:47,280
No, Dasein is always open to a world.

733
01:17:47,840 --> 01:18:02,080
He has to get his sense that Dasein is open to and coping in a shared world together with each Dasein has to take a stand on its being and have its for the sake of which.

734
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:07,200
And somehow in these pages right here, he thinks he's doing it.

735
01:18:07,441 --> 01:18:10,880
Now, lots of hands are come up, and if you all want to help him do it, that's good with me.

736
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:11,521
Go ahead.

737
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,040
World, but relationship eminent one with the world.

738
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,080
Why do you say that?

739
01:18:29,241 --> 01:18:30,601
Unfolding.

740
01:18:30,601 --> 01:18:33,800
Okay, sort of, why not say it always exists?

741
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,800
I mean, it never is never finished, but it's really always going on.

742
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,040
Okay.

743
01:18:38,441 --> 01:18:40,920
Genealogically unfolding.

744
01:18:41,561 --> 01:18:43,080
Peleologically.

745
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:44,920
Genealogically.

746
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:46,120
What is that?

747
01:18:47,401 --> 01:19:13,561
That's a way that I guess like anti-or post-structuralists would later on describe it, but a way in which, I mean, if the thing is all permanently becoming within the world alongside other genealogical elements that are differentiating themselves, always coming from a path that having been and becoming.

748
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:41,080
I can't really understand how that's going to solve this very basic problem of how we're going to get ourselves as what was once upon a time subjects related to the world, which is once upon a time objects, in such a way that we can in no way get ourselves trapped into our own stream of experience or our own perspective.

749
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:41,800
Yeah.

750
01:19:42,441 --> 01:19:43,240
Yeah.

751
01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:44,360
Yeah.

752
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:51,240
Well, I think we've gotten to this deep level where he's trying to explain how it's possible for Dasein to be that kind of being with.

753
01:19:51,241 --> 01:20:08,401
I mean, yes, Dasein is certainly in the world with other Daseins, and it's doing that somehow in a way that's tied up with its having its own for the sake of which, and therefore its own take on the world and everything.

754
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,040
How is he going to get these two together?

755
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:17,360
And it looks like he thinks he's getting them together right here, but we don't see yet how it's happening.

756
01:20:17,361 --> 01:20:17,601
Yeah.

757
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:36,641
We won't say that Dasein shares the world and thus Dasein did not be the world, but not the identified with the world.

758
01:20:36,641 --> 01:20:49,440
But in saying that Dasein did the world eclipsically, that they, each individual Dasein, each one of us, could be the world eclipsingly in a different way and still share the same world.

759
01:20:50,161 --> 01:21:03,840
And I mean, I guess that would that would be why Dasein was like a modification upon the world rather than a separate sphere wherein everything else is.

760
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:27,040
Yeah, yeah, I think somehow we've got to come up with the, and you're on the right track, the way uh what a world, whatever a world is, it's something that you can be in such a way as to not as to not be separate from it and yet not every not be identical with every with everybody else who is the world.

761
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:35,120
And we're trying and I s I mean, surely he thinks here he said something very important about that, namely the business about horizons and ecstasies.

762
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:40,720
I'm beginning to think I sort of understand it, thanks to you all, but I I'll wait till you all talk and see if I can say it.

763
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:45,760
That way of being his way of being is called Daza.

764
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:55,880
That's sort of the puzzle we're trying to solve.

765
01:21:56,441 --> 01:22:02,280
Well, I think he thinks existing Dazine is the there, is the clearing.

766
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:11,160
I mean, this is the extreme emptiness of the empty mind turns to open to this shared something or other.

767
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:15,401
The problem is missing Dahlia and both viewable and within the world.

768
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,321
It's the world from within it.

769
01:22:17,321 --> 01:22:19,800
That's just another of the funny things.

770
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,561
Worlds are not, that's how worlds are.

771
01:22:23,561 --> 01:22:26,920
I'm in the academic world from within the academic world.

772
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,641
That's just not a problem.

773
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:30,280
Yeah.

774
01:22:31,241 --> 01:22:41,000
As far as the false control is concerned, the way that they think all two are, they're not just net each other or working together.

775
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,361
They're so easily engaged to be inseparable.

776
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:45,880
That's what we're talking about.

777
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:51,080
You can't, but I don't think it's all data that you cannot lease.

778
01:22:53,481 --> 01:22:54,680
Try to separate them.

779
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,800
That's impossible.

780
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,321
So I don't think that sounds good.

781
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,040
As far as ultimate concern, I don't know how to deal with that.

782
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,401
That sounds incredibly hard.

783
01:23:01,401 --> 01:23:15,000
But I mean, maybe it's more than that thing, but of course, the world which Dahai engages in is really the same world which other Dahlians engage with different dogma.

784
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:26,120
So even if there were a decent sort of separation, there would be some sort of case machine in the different elements that's forming the whole uniform world.

785
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:35,920
And all the formula said to non-profit is when we talk about the allegations of words, then the word signals I think is a really good word.

786
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:53,680
I'd like to say there are the only basis of well, maybe I'll let me paraphrase it in something that sounds like it makes sense anyway.

787
01:23:53,680 --> 01:24:05,360
That you are your disclosedness, but being your disclosedness is your way of opening on to the world.

788
01:24:05,361 --> 01:24:09,200
I'm just doing my sort of perspective with other words.

789
01:24:09,201 --> 01:24:13,200
Or, I mean, you what sense does it mean to say you are your disclosed?

790
01:24:13,201 --> 01:24:16,481
Well, disclosedness is somehow something that you can be.

791
01:24:16,481 --> 01:24:25,040
You are your disclosing or disclosing, you are disclosing all the time, and it's your disclosing.

792
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:37,040
And but what you're disclosing is a world, and worlds are, and the world, or what you're disclosing is a shared world with other people and shared equipment and so forth.

793
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:50,401
Why can't the disclosing why can't you be the disclosing activity of a sharedly of it of a one disclosed world?

794
01:24:50,401 --> 01:24:53,440
I'm just trying just to find a formulation that will work.

795
01:24:53,441 --> 01:24:53,680
Yeah.

796
01:24:54,161 --> 01:25:06,880
But when Heger laid out the taxonomy of worlds, and he had laid out the third one, which is the important one, the weariness, even within that, he says there's more than the world can be understood more than what sense.

797
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:13,760
He says the weariness of facts will go out and be said to live.

798
01:25:14,321 --> 01:25:19,561
World may stand for the public deed world, or one of those domestic environments.

799
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:25,641
So here it seems like it's not just that much, you know, world is a thousand centuries.

800
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:29,080
You don't think it send our world their way, but it's not.

801
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,960
Okay, but wouldn't we have the same problem back?

802
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,601
Just let's start with the domestic environment, sort of following Eugene's way of thinking.

803
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:48,840
What does it mean to say you are your your domestic environment in such instead of you are it well that's so strange.

804
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:54,521
I mean I can say you disclose you're the activity of disclosing your domestic environment.

805
01:25:54,521 --> 01:25:57,240
That seems to be the right way to go.

806
01:26:00,601 --> 01:26:05,080
But then he does say you're you're and that's the existingly, I guess.

807
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,441
You're the world existing.

808
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:14,360
You are the activity of disclosing or clearing a shared world or clearing.

809
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,240
I'm just trying to and why does he think?

810
01:26:18,201 --> 01:26:22,840
Let me say something before I give me I thought I was on the right track.

811
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:29,481
I want this it ought to come out really simple, believe it or not, if you just get the right clue.

812
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:56,880
And I think I was on the right track when I wanted to say that being a professor is both something that I have to do on my in my own taking a stand on my being and it's a for the sake of which in the referential totality it and I so when so when I is the for the sake of which, try to put it this way, something, which I surely am.

813
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:05,040
I mean, that defines me, that's my identity and but my identity involves all this shared equipment.

814
01:27:05,201 --> 01:27:40,960
And I want to say something like: if you read all this about the future and the for the sake of which, you ought to be able to find out that Dasein is both self-defined by taking a stand on its being, by having an ultimate for the sake of which, and that that's the ecstasy part, and that that has its horizon that there have to be students and equipment and all kinds of public stuff, and that they sort of totally belong to each other.

815
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:51,280
That you start with the ecstasy, because Dasein starts with the, you start with the being and takes a stand on its being, and he thinks that's the most important dimension, the futural dimension.

816
01:27:51,281 --> 01:28:03,440
But as soon as you try to say what, you know, how to describe that, you immediately have to, and that's the ecstasy, you immediately have to bring in the horizon.

817
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,440
And what is the horizon?

818
01:28:05,441 --> 01:28:22,401
It's that sort of public, shared for the sake of which, and now, and that enables you to say you are, and how's that related to the world?

819
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:26,800
Well, that's part of a big complicated structure, which is a world structure.

820
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:38,720
And you've got, you defined yourself in terms of a sort of speak piece of that world structure, described as your for the sake of which.

821
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,521
And you really are that.

822
01:28:41,521 --> 01:28:43,601
I'm trying to bring in the identity story.

823
01:28:43,601 --> 01:28:55,720
That when you get your identity in terms of something in the future, you ultimately, you automatically bring in that there is something in the future that you're getting your identity in terms of.

824
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:58,281
And it's not, of course, the thing you're ever going to achieve.

825
01:28:58,281 --> 01:29:03,641
It's that kind of authentic kind of future, being a professor.

826
01:29:03,641 --> 01:29:05,160
But is that helping?

827
01:29:05,401 --> 01:29:20,521
I think if you really try to think it out and do it the way he does it and describe the temporal dimensions of coping and just with equipment and how that is structured, as he does in the beginning, or the equipmental totality, never mind the coping.

828
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:25,720
You describe the equipmental totality and you describe Dasein taking a stand on its being.

829
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:29,080
And way at the beginning, those seem totally different.

830
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:51,880
But by the time you get to this page 416 and 417, you've earned the right to say that they're not totally different, that there is some way in which you are defined by the world, but you're defined in your way by the world, and other people are defined in their way by the world.

831
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,160
Is that helping any at all?

832
01:29:53,161 --> 01:29:55,800
You looking a little bit enlightened.

833
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,440
No?

834
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,441
But you don't think it solves the problem.

835
01:29:58,441 --> 01:30:00,040
All right, he shouldn't say is.

836
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,880
He shouldn't say is the world, right?

837
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,800
I think I just wouldn't substitute discloses.

838
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:17,720
If you say Dasein discloses the world existingly, or a world, or its world, I don't think it matters anymore with the notion of disclosing, succeeding.

839
01:30:18,281 --> 01:30:35,840
Well, and I want to say he if we read this again, heaven forbid, all through, we'd see that the way he's setting up the Xthasis and the whole thing in terms of Dasein taking a stand on its being and how it's thrown and how it's coping in the present.

840
01:30:36,161 --> 01:30:44,880
And he's describing the world in terms of having for the sake of which is and significance and throwingness.

841
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:54,080
He will be setting it up so that these two structures are not just parallel, but they are like two sides of something.

842
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:55,521
I think he's done it.

843
01:30:56,161 --> 01:31:12,240
What I'm thinking is maybe for the first time, I'm beginning to understand why he thinks he can just suddenly tell us in italics that every ecstatic unity has something like a horizon and think that that tells us that Dasein is its world existingly.

844
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:17,120
It's cause, and I think that's what the sort of thing he's been trying to achieve.

845
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,481
Okay, now I told somebody over here somewhere, yeah.

846
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:48,080
Nobody really thought about that reflexive type of interdependent nature because not only that the file for the sake of which is in terms of around the basic world, the world itself shows up differently when the file for the sake of which is altered or so here he comes to from any other file for the sake of which the actual articulation as well.

847
01:31:48,080 --> 01:32:15,040
And so maybe in that way, the horizon both interconnected and that means in terms of South African but then I mean what what Eugene is always worrying about is if but when the chips are down, even with my disclosiveness talk, are you saying that you were your disclosedness, or are you saying you're a disclosiveness?

848
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,800
Are you saying you're the disclosiveness?

849
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,720
That's where the old subject-object thing is around.

850
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:52,760
And he's trying to define significance and worldhood in such a way that they are so intimately related to Dasein and existing and taking a stand on your being as a way of disclosing that you can understand how we can all be different and yet be all open.

851
01:32:53,481 --> 01:32:56,920
We are all somehow different openings on one world.

852
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,601
That's what he has to show.

853
01:32:58,601 --> 01:33:15,561
And I think he thinks that he's shown it when he's shown that the dis the ecstatical structure of opening and the horizonal destructure of significance are interdefined in such a way, somehow.

854
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,120
Yeah, you want to say something about that?

855
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:23,241
There's a Dasein side of the world side or next.

856
01:33:23,401 --> 01:33:23,720
Right.

857
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,521
Right, right, right.

858
01:33:26,521 --> 01:33:27,641
Yeah, that's not right.

859
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:28,361
I take that back.

860
01:33:29,241 --> 01:33:31,321
But it's not as many as one thing.

861
01:33:31,561 --> 01:33:31,960
Right.

862
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:36,441
So Dasein is being in the world with hyphens.

863
01:33:36,441 --> 01:33:45,561
And now, having gone through all of this, we have an understanding of what it is to be being in the world, hopefully.

864
01:33:45,561 --> 01:33:47,240
And I think that's what he thinks he's doing.

865
01:33:47,241 --> 01:33:52,521
Before I call on somebody else, there's a place where he relates it to being in the world, right around here.

866
01:33:52,521 --> 01:33:54,521
Is it maybe right exactly here?

867
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:55,641
Let's see.

868
01:33:55,601 --> 01:34:01,000
Uh I don't see it right off, so let let's whoever's got another hand up.

869
01:34:01,641 --> 01:34:03,401
417, you see it?

870
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,481
Okay, maybe uh having its ground in the world is transcendent.

871
01:34:08,481 --> 01:34:11,040
Is there being in the world Oh, right before that.

872
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:11,680
Oh, good.

873
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,040
That's what one would hope to find.

874
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,000
Let's read that.

875
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:22,000
The world is already presupposed in one's being alongside the ready to hand concernedly and factually in one's thematizing and so forth and so forth.

876
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:32,000
That is to say, all these possible ways of being in the world have all these are oh sorry, are all these are possible ways of being in the world.

877
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:39,680
Having its ground in the horizonal unity of ecstatical temporality, the world is transcendent.

878
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,401
Uh good, yes.

879
01:34:43,040 --> 01:35:16,321
Not transcendental, not but transcendent because and uh oh which is through Kantian, not transcendent in the sense of Husserlian getting outside your mind, but there's the world, he says, is more outside than anything, and that's when when you understand that, you understand how you could be both have it be its world, have it be you are your world existingly because there's they're so interdefined that they're not even like two faces.

880
01:35:16,321 --> 01:35:17,361
So that we're getting there.

881
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:21,441
Hey, I thought that you would get there eventually and I w and I would learn a lot.

882
01:35:21,441 --> 01:35:21,840
Yeah.

883
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:23,680
No, no, tell us someone.

884
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,440
We're we're I'm ready.

885
01:35:25,441 --> 01:35:27,280
We could we can take it.

886
01:35:27,281 --> 01:35:27,680
Okay.

887
01:35:28,161 --> 01:35:29,521
Temporality.

888
01:35:29,521 --> 01:35:31,120
Will you say that again?

889
01:35:31,361 --> 01:35:34,720
Well it's wonderful.

890
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:44,641
But if there's something like the temporal, you think we're sort of bringing together world and government and Daily doesn't I thought the world just is back with English.

891
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:48,641
If you understand the temporal islands of the world, everything is involved together.

892
01:35:48,601 --> 01:36:06,040
And that was we're trying to bring together the fact that Dazzler is trying to bring together in the world is not the two aspects of cosmology, but rather that in the world is brought together that Dazine exists and takes a stand on it.

893
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:09,880
And then you find out sometimes ready to end, but more problematically.

894
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:20,760
And so there's going to be a story about temporality and kind of what brings together in the world all the bones of ready to own your public.

895
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:23,720
And all bones are being that's what's being brought together in the world.

896
01:36:39,241 --> 01:36:40,601
I'm having trouble.

897
01:36:40,601 --> 01:36:44,200
I mean, I think it's probably important, so I want to understand it, but I don't yet.

898
01:36:44,201 --> 01:36:47,720
Do you understand how what he's saying differs from what I'm saying?

899
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:51,641
I don't well.

900
01:36:51,641 --> 01:37:06,120
Well, I mean, I can't understand you sort of from the start because he seems to be the ex-dases are definitely the structure of temporality for of Dazine.

901
01:37:06,441 --> 01:37:11,800
And he says, and every exodus has a horizon.

902
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:17,641
That seems to be, I don't know what it is, but how do you understand it?

903
01:37:17,641 --> 01:37:20,280
I mean, I understand it.

904
01:37:20,281 --> 01:37:30,601
As I said, it sounds to me like every time I've got a defining d stand on my own being, I've also plugged into some shared stuff.

905
01:37:30,561 --> 01:37:38,240
Uh and I don't see him talking about world doing that job.

906
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:48,481
The uh the I'm looking at something, the unity of significance, which is the onsol ontological constitution of the world, must be grounded in temporality.

907
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:51,521
Doesn't that seem like the opposite of what you were saying?

908
01:37:51,521 --> 01:37:54,720
You seem to be wanting to make world the ultimate thing.

909
01:37:55,441 --> 01:37:58,641
Yeah, that's that that's certainly what he's asking, among other things.

910
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,120
Let's look at the crucial quotes.

911
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:05,680
I don't know.

912
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:08,561
The bottom of 415, back to that.

913
01:38:08,561 --> 01:38:17,280
The question arises how anything like the world in its unity with Dasein is ontologically possible.

914
01:38:17,281 --> 01:38:19,280
Is that supporting what you said?

915
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,080
Sounds reasonable, yeah.

916
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,441
Yeah, I think so far we're in agreement.

917
01:38:45,521 --> 01:38:49,521
I see I see, but I'm not sure that's what's happening here.

918
01:38:49,521 --> 01:38:52,000
That's in so far as I'm going to look at something else here.

919
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,240
The top of 417.

920
01:38:55,601 --> 01:38:59,040
Whereas I'm looking for 416 so I can begin there.

921
01:38:59,040 --> 01:38:59,920
Okay.

922
01:39:00,241 --> 01:39:09,680
The horizonal unity of the schemata of the ecstasies makes possible the primordial way in which the relationship of the in order to are connected with the for the sake of.

923
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:18,521
This implies that on the basis of the horizonal constitution of the ecstatical, unity of temporality.

924
01:39:18,521 --> 01:39:19,960
That's already strange, isn't it?

925
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:23,561
It looked like the horizon, more basic, is supposed to be the ecstatical.

926
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:37,481
And the horizon is supposed to be connected with each ecstasy, where in italics the condition for the possibility of the world lies in on 416.

927
01:39:37,481 --> 01:39:42,521
The fact that temporality is an ecstatical unity has something like a horizon.

928
01:39:42,521 --> 01:39:57,960
This implies that on the now the bottom, on the basis of the horizon constitution of the ecstatical unity of temporality, there belongs to that entity, which is in each case its own there, something like a world that has been disclosed.

929
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:18,280
Boy, that does certainly look like the issue is, I mean, I'm not sure which issue, but I keep wanting to say it looks like the issue is how to get together something like their the ownness and the sharedness.

930
01:40:18,281 --> 01:40:22,200
And I keep having trouble, we're just having trouble understanding each other.

931
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:43,000
But it's not that existing.

932
01:40:43,401 --> 01:40:43,960
No, it doesn't.

933
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:44,281
It doesn't.

934
01:40:44,281 --> 01:40:45,080
It says its world.

935
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:45,720
No, you're right.

936
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:46,601
It says.

937
01:40:57,161 --> 01:40:59,160
It's not necessarily the parts.

938
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,960
I think you're on the wrong track.

939
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:58,481
He wouldn't have gone through all this work of bringing in the towards which and the for the sake of which when he talks about the world, and the for the sake of which also when he talks about Dasein taking a stand on its being and getting its identity, if he didn't have as the final agenda the the dimensions of Dasein's ecstatical threefold structure with it for the sake of which amidst enthrone and the temporal structure of the world which has in it for the sake of which s lots of for the sake of which is all hooked together into significance and into what I don't know some past thing and I mean he goes to such trouble to lay those two structures out all over the place and I don't see why we he wouldn't be cashing in on that at this point.

940
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,641
Oh yeah, I want to say something, yeah.

941
01:42:08,641 --> 01:42:15,601
I don't think, I mean, I I can't really I mean it always bothers me, I can't belie I don't think death could be the final for the sake of which.

942
01:42:15,601 --> 01:42:18,240
I mean that that's what Sartre thought Heidegger was saying.

943
01:42:18,561 --> 01:42:23,920
And Sartre rightly said, but who in the world would live their life for the sake of their death?

944
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,601
I mean that doesn't make any sense.

945
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:38,720
So the I think the ultimate for the sake of which has got to be your identity, your defining understanding of who you are, or embodied understanding or whatever it is of who you are.

946
01:42:38,720 --> 01:43:09,000
And the fact that the future is a for the sake of which in the world and is a for the sake of which for each particular Dasein, that's got to be a clue that these two are not even two aspects, as Eugene said, but they are the same thing, taken up by the only thing that could take them up, namely Dasein as being in the world.

947
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,561
And that's what he thinks he's done.

948
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:23,800
Okay, we still have, well, let me, no, before we go on, I don't want to come back to anything that I was going to say here, but I think we've gotten to much more serious business.

949
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:28,840
I will tell you in a minute whether I think there's any reason why I have to go back to it.

950
01:43:30,281 --> 01:43:31,720
Go ahead, say something, huh?

951
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,000
I like that.

952
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,160
My mistake to say aspects.

953
01:43:35,161 --> 01:43:39,720
They are the same thing, the for the sake of which of being a professor.

954
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:54,200
That's but it's something that is both serving two jobs, namely giving me an identity and giving me lots of equipment to play around with in order to have that identity.

955
01:43:54,201 --> 01:43:55,481
Why can't we say that?

956
01:43:55,481 --> 01:43:58,680
Those aren't two aspects because there's much more tightly.

957
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:06,840
I couldn't be a professor without this equipment to play around with, and it wouldn't be equipment to be a professor if I didn't have it as my identity.

958
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,760
Is that getting it?

959
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:13,160
I mean, that's a good route I think that's the clue that you gave me somewhere along the line.

960
01:44:13,161 --> 01:44:13,720
Yeah.

961
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:15,561
417, okay.

962
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:17,320
Okay.

963
01:44:18,201 --> 01:44:20,521
You will end up chapter 5.

964
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:24,680
I don't I want to have to see where you are before I can understand what you're saying.

965
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:26,200
The bottom of 417?

966
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,120
Rather, we must ask.

967
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,800
Is that in the bottom of 417?

968
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,720
Oh, yeah, the very, very, very bottom.

969
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:32,521
I got it.

970
01:44:32,521 --> 01:44:33,080
Okay.

971
01:44:34,481 --> 01:44:40,880
Rather we must ask what makes it ontologically possible to be encountered within the world and objectify as though encountered.

972
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:49,680
This can be answered by reference to the transcendence of the world, a transcendence which has an ecst ecstatico horizonal foundation.

973
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,160
Well that seems awfully important, all right, but let's go let me look at the next paragraph.

974
01:44:54,161 --> 01:44:57,280
Everybody read the first paragraph on the top of 418.

975
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:09,680
That's the place where I was looking for being in the world, where being in the world is traced back to the ecstatico-horizonal unity of temporality, the existential ontological possibility of the space basic data Dasein is intelligible.

976
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:28,481
That looks like the bottom line, that you got to understand how being in the world with hyphens can be Dasein and can be the world, all so much the same thing and yet so different is what he's doing there.

977
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:38,160
I wanted to go back though just a little before where Stephen started reading because there's lots of talk about its world and that's always a clue that something important is happening.

978
01:45:38,401 --> 01:45:39,441
Three lines down.

979
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:50,960
What is rather the case is that factical Dasein understands itself in its world, that seems like a perspective, ecstatically in the unity of the there.

980
01:45:51,920 --> 01:46:02,320
Let's see, what is rather the case is that factual design understanding itself and its world ecstatically in the unity of the there comes back from these horizons to the entities encountered within them.

981
01:46:02,321 --> 01:46:04,561
That's what sort of what you're talking about maybe.

982
01:46:04,561 --> 01:46:06,400
The entities get in there.

983
01:46:06,401 --> 01:46:12,240
Coming back to these entities understandingly is an existential meaning of letting them be encountered by making them present.

984
01:46:12,241 --> 01:46:15,840
That is why we call them entities within the world.

985
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:24,200
We've gone from its world to the world in sort of the way I would like to do it, but it doesn't happen here.

986
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:31,481
It's world being the world of a professor and the world being the world of a professor.

987
01:46:32,441 --> 01:46:34,280
They're the same, and yet they're different.

988
01:46:34,281 --> 01:46:36,441
That is why we call these entities within the world.

989
01:46:36,441 --> 01:46:40,521
The world is, as it were, already further outside than any object can ever be.

990
01:46:40,521 --> 01:46:41,800
That doesn't seem to help.

991
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:46,200
The problem of transcendence cannot be brought around to the question of how a subject, well, that's sure.

992
01:46:46,201 --> 01:46:51,720
But we want to know what makes it ontologically possible for entities to be encountered within the world.

993
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:53,240
Well, that doesn't help any.

994
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:54,200
Does it?

995
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:56,280
I don't think so.

996
01:46:58,201 --> 01:47:00,040
What's the conclusion you wanted to draw, Steve?

997
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,240
Steve, and I got.

998
01:47:01,561 --> 01:47:07,800
You guys, it does seem to be in a kind of Tyler ballpark where we're talking about the entities in the world.

999
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:12,200
We might as well be talking about the way of being of entities in the world.

1000
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:41,160
All I can say about that is that that seems to be a sort of spin-off from the more basic problem, which is the problem of how to understand being in the world and how to do it in terms of the ecstasies, which remember are the temporal structure of Dasein, and the fact that, the amazing, crucial fact that they all, every ecstasis has something like a horizon.

1001
01:47:42,361 --> 01:47:48,040
And that horizonal schema, and it's, and then let's go on.

1002
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,120
The schema, I'm back on 416.

1003
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:57,400
The schema in which Dasein comes towards itself futurally, whether authentically or inauthentically, is for the sake of itself.

1004
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:09,920
The schema in which Dasein is disclosed to itself in a state of mind in Befinlichkeit as thrown is to be taken as that in the faces of which it's been thrown and to which it has been abandoned.

1005
01:48:10,641 --> 01:48:14,481
That's the characteristic of the what has been.

1006
01:48:14,481 --> 01:48:26,561
In existing for the sake of itself, in abandonment to itself as something that has been thrown, Dasein is being alongside, as being amidst, is at the same time making present the horizon structure of presence as defined in order to.

1007
01:48:27,281 --> 01:48:45,120
There he's just bringing together, it looks to me like, the combinations where the temporal future characterizes both Dasein and the world together, and the temporal present the same, and the temporal past the same.

1008
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:47,760
And does that get any better?

1009
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:55,120
The unity of the horizon schema of future past, future, present, and having been is grounded in the ecstatical unity of temporality.

1010
01:48:55,120 --> 01:49:00,000
Notice the priority of the Dasein way of talking about it.

1011
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,240
The stand on its own being seems to be what's finally the bottom line.

1012
01:49:04,241 --> 01:49:14,320
The horizonal temporality as a whole determines the upon which factical entities are essentially disclosed.

1013
01:49:14,641 --> 01:49:15,840
Hmm.

1014
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:21,441
I'm just trying to feel whether this is now pro-Tyler, pro-Blatner, pro-Dreyfus.

1015
01:49:21,441 --> 01:49:22,321
I can't remember.

1016
01:49:22,561 --> 01:49:26,800
All these positions are sort of merging in my head.

1017
01:49:27,201 --> 01:49:32,800
Does that what I just read support what I've been saying, or not?

1018
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:35,840
Let's try, I mean, here's more of the same talk.

1019
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,680
I just keep I've marked it all over.

1020
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,880
That on four seventeen.

1021
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:49,080
That just as the present arises in the unity of the temporalizing of temporality out of the future and having been, the horizon of presence temporalized, now we're on the horizon side.

1022
01:49:48,481 --> 01:49:50,920
That was the ecstasic side.

1023
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:56,601
The horizon of the present temporalizes itself equiprimorio with those of future and having been.

1024
01:49:56,601 --> 01:50:00,920
Insofar as Dasein temporalizes itself, a world is too.

1025
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:04,200
And temporalizing itself with regard to its being is temporality.

1026
01:50:04,201 --> 01:50:12,120
Dasein is essentially in a world by reason of the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of its temporality.

1027
01:50:12,441 --> 01:50:17,561
I I keep wanting to say the real issue seems to be how Dasein can be being in the world.

1028
01:50:17,561 --> 01:50:27,800
And the issue seems to be to state these three the threefold structure both in a world way and in a di in a in a take a stand on your own being way.

1029
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,960
And I'm not sure that's a big deal difference.

1030
01:50:33,401 --> 01:50:35,401
That isn't something that plays a big role in here.

1031
01:50:35,401 --> 01:50:37,800
It doesn't even get mentioned because it Yes, it's right.

1032
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,360
It's got to be along amidst, let's say.

1033
01:50:40,361 --> 01:50:42,840
Dasein has got to be amidst entities.

1034
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,601
That's the present structure.

1035
01:50:44,601 --> 01:50:47,401
And that present structure is again both sides.

1036
01:50:47,401 --> 01:50:55,000
Dasein can't be amidst entities ecstatically if there aren't entities out there to be amidst horizonally.

1037
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,680
It seems to be the same story again.

1038
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,360
I would have thought the alongsidedness has both in it.

1039
01:51:02,361 --> 01:51:06,920
That is, the both it's if you can't be alongside it if it isn't there and if you aren't there.

1040
01:51:20,361 --> 01:51:28,840
I see what you're doing and and the funny thing is I like it, but I don't think it's the thing to be doing here, to bring in sort of nature and so forth.

1041
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:38,160
I mean w here he's talking about equipment, uh that is stuff which has its own for the sake of which, which electrons don't have.

1042
01:51:38,161 --> 01:51:42,000
And he and he's putting it that way on purpose so that the two get together.

1043
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:51,040
He has I mean I think he does have that I think it's on 414 that he he got the the how the theoretical how entities can show up for pure discovery.

1044
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,720
That's in the vicinity.

1045
01:51:52,720 --> 01:52:05,521
But having done that on 414, he goes on to the temporal problem of the transcendence of world, and that seems to me to leave but leave behind the question about electrons.

1046
01:52:09,361 --> 01:52:10,320
I don't believe it.

1047
01:52:10,321 --> 01:52:11,840
I don't believe it at all.

1048
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:16,481
I think the question of transcendence is all over the place.

1049
01:52:16,481 --> 01:52:21,040
In fact, I thought we just this chapter began with talking about transcendence.

1050
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,320
Now I don't know.

1051
01:52:22,481 --> 01:52:27,760
But it's also falling but it'll be done we can ignore entities right at all.

1052
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:28,880
That might be true.

1053
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:48,240
I find what you're saying perfectly relevant to what's going on on page 414 where he's talking about science and the unready to hand and the whole kind of well how does this name of this chapter let's see what it whether it's got transcend the temporal meaning of the circumscriptive concern modified in theoretical discovery.

1054
01:52:48,321 --> 01:52:54,240
Seems to me that's just one issue and then there's this issue of the problem of the transcendence of the world.

1055
01:52:54,241 --> 01:52:55,521
But we've got to stop.

1056
01:52:55,521 --> 01:53:01,680
I saw one hand that I won't keep people from talking, but it's time by my light.

1057
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,880
We've had enough and I think it's been very helpful.

1058
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,521
I'm not sure how I'll feel about it tomorrow.

1059
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:08,800
But thanks for trying.

1060
01:53:09,201 --> 01:53:11,920
And the next time, let me just tell you what's happening.

1061
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:18,601
See, we're one whole thing behind, because I fell into this dark hole, which I now feel I've sort of been pulled out of.

1062
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,481
We haven't gotten to the ordinary conception of time, which was supposed to be today.

1063
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,680
So we're going to do the ordinary conception of time next time.

1064
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:31,240
You'll be happy to hear, if you're all brave, put up with it.

1065
01:53:31,241 --> 01:53:33,000
It won't be abstract like this.

1066
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,960
It's very sort of down-to-earth description of everyday life.

1067
01:53:38,361 --> 01:53:39,641
You go ahead and leave if you want.

1068
01:53:39,641 --> 01:53:45,641
I'm going to look at what I said to make sure that I at least said what was best I can.

1069
01:53:45,641 --> 01:53:48,280
Don't don't I'm not going to say anything more to you all.

1070
01:53:48,281 --> 01:53:53,720
The lect the lecture is over, but I'm not well I want to check something.
