1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
So, the first one is the methodological issue.

2
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:08,400
And I just want to constantly sort of stress my reordering of it.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:26,160
It looks like finally, with guilt, conscience, resoluteness, death, anticipatory resoluteness, historicality, fate, and destiny, we now ought to have the whole of authentic Dasein in our grasp.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,240
But anything short of that, we wouldn't.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:45,800
So, it's a good, so that's why I think you have to put all those pieces together first, and then you get to a point where you ask, have we now got the whole of the phenomena so that we can, and how are we going to, and what kind of hole have we got, and how are we going to deal with it?

6
00:00:46,521 --> 00:01:00,761
And it seems, we remember we didn't know what whole meant and why somehow you didn't have a whole when he starts the problem and brings in death and the ahead of itself.

7
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:11,560
I think it becomes pretty clear that normally by whole, he means the total structure of Daseine.

8
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:21,801
And what's funny is he's got the total structure of Dasein when he's got the structure of care, and he's got the structure of care already in Division I.

9
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:26,840
So it's still not clear to me what is missing.

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:42,680
He seems to be using, as far as I can see, synonymously, Dasein being authentic, being whole, and the totality of the totalness of the phenomena being exhibited in what Dasein is doing.

11
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,720
I'll just read you 358, one of the places where you get these three all coming together.

12
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:56,280
At the beginning, well, the very first sentence of that section on the hermeneutic situation.

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,521
And by the way, I saw, I see, well, care and self-hood aren't in the same section.

14
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,161
I said they were.

15
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,641
They're just as contiguous.

16
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,481
And selfhood might as well be there as anywhere.

17
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:10,601
So let's go back to now.

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,960
At the very beginning on section 63.

19
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:26,680
So, in its anticipatory resoluteness, Dasein has now been phenomenally, has been made phenomenally visible with regards to its possible authenticity and totality.

20
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:32,801
And I'm pretty sure that the authenticity, totality is the same as the whole.

21
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:35,521
And we've now made it visible.

22
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:49,201
This is connected with the thing I said at first, but how he wouldn't be able to say that if he wasn't lucky enough to be reordered by me, because he wouldn't have everything there in its totality and whole yet.

23
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:56,881
He'd have a lot of lots of explaining to do about historicality at the very least coming up.

24
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,321
But he's got it the way we've got it.

25
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:03,280
We've got it all total and whole.

26
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:14,160
And now he tells us that as we study Dasein, we're always in a hermeneutic circle.

27
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,600
And that's a new, that's why this is the hermeneutic situation.

28
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:28,641
And it's interesting that he seldom ever makes explicit the sort of rules of the game of doing a hermeneutic analysis.

29
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,881
He goes over that very fast.

30
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:39,681
It's funny how famous he is, I guess thanks to Gottamer for having introduced the hermeneutic method, when he says practically nothing about it.

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:56,720
But he does say, when he introduces it, that there's a four-haba, a four-zicht, and a four-grift, a for-having, a foresight, and a four-conception, it gets translated, involved in hermeneutic investigation, and that it moves in a circle.

32
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,081
And he's going to bring up explicitly the circle.

33
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:10,561
But if you look for it, you can see that he's doing the forhaba, for zicht, Four Griff story as from the very beginning of the section.

34
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:24,680
If you just read you the little pieces, the next sentence says: the hermeneutic situation, which was previously inadequate for interpreting the meaning of the being of care, now has the required primordiality.

35
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,201
Dasein has been put into that which we have in advance.

36
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,681
See, that's the forehaving.

37
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:34,121
And this has been done primordially.

38
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,761
That is to say, this has been done with regard to its authentic ability to be a whole.

39
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,160
So there's the whole coming in again.

40
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,801
The idea of existence which guides us.

41
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,920
Well, now, stop with that.

42
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:56,201
So the first thing is we've got in our forehaving the whole structure of Dasein.

43
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:59,960
And we don't so much have it because we're in it.

44
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,241
We are it.

45
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:03,081
And that turns out to be important.

46
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:22,360
You have to think, well, Heidegger's telling you, and he'll come back to this, I will at the end, that he's authentic and that he's speaking from within, a total understanding or experience, primordial experience of what it is to be Dasein.

47
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,641
On 360, there's more about that.

48
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:29,160
Well, I'm getting it out of the sentence at the end of the top paragraph.

49
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:37,321
Every ontologically explicit question about Dasein's being has had the way prepared for it by the kind of being which Dasein has.

50
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:39,561
That's a reference to the forehaving.

51
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:47,720
That says, in effect, it's from within it that Dasein is going to describe it.

52
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,840
And then he comes to the four Zicht, that is the four sides.

53
00:05:52,840 --> 00:06:07,761
And there he says, the idea of existence which guides us is as that which we see in advance, that's foresight, has been made definite by the clarification of our own most potential ability to be.

54
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:23,201
And now that we've concretely worked out the structure of Dasein's being, his peculiar ontological character has become so plain as compared with everything present at hand, that Dasein's existentiality has been grasped in advance.

55
00:06:23,201 --> 00:06:25,761
That's the four concept.

56
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:34,081
That is, grasped in advance with sufficient articulation to give sure guidance for working out the existentialia conceptually.

57
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:37,761
See, so we now, that's somehow a four-conception.

58
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:40,240
I don't find all that very illuminating.

59
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:48,720
He never explains enough about what these terms mean that you know whether why he's sort of got them in here.

60
00:06:48,720 --> 00:07:04,321
But I'm just telling you what he clearly thinks, that he's operating out of a forehaving and he's got a particular sense that he's already committed to looking at existence, which is the being that takes a stand on its own being.

61
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:11,040
So we've got, we're inside of an understanding of being and of understanding of Dasein.

62
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:19,921
We've got as our way of describing that its being, that what's essential about it is that its being is an issue for it.

63
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,040
And we've got as our goal to work out the existentialia.

64
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,361
Conceptually sounds sort of strange to me.

65
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:29,761
Sometimes he says articulate them.

66
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,641
I mean, I don't know what he means by conceptual, but it's now gotten such a meaning that it sounds too much like a lot of intentional content.

67
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:52,681
But all it means is that he's going to now spell out and describe in explicit detail the aspects of the existential structure of Dasean.

68
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:00,681
Now, so far, and we're always moving in a hermeneutic circle, telling us on 358.

69
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,361
On 358, I don't, I become surprised.

70
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,761
That's totally the circle, yeah.

71
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:12,680
Well, what I just read is moving in the hermeneutic circle.

72
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:17,641
I just, that is to say we are inside it.

73
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:23,001
And that's all we're going to hear about the hermeneutic circle for a bit.

74
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:30,841
Because a great big issue comes up in the next paragraph on 359, and I have to talk about it where it comes up.

75
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:38,841
And to me, it's very important, and maybe it isn't important to anybody else, and maybe I made it up, and you know, worry about it.

76
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,721
But I think there are two different meanings of falling, or three, really.

77
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:47,881
One of them means being absorbed in what you're doing.

78
00:08:48,201 --> 00:09:01,481
Another one means, I think, being so well, it'll get clearer when I can only explain it when we're in it, so let me tell you more.

79
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:22,921
But he's going to explain why, let's try this angle, that he's going to tell us right now, but I'm going to come back to it, that when you do this kind of hermeneutic study of Dasein, anyway, you have to do violence to the subject, you have to wrest the truth from the subject, and so forth.

80
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,800
Now, that means at least you have to do formal indication.

81
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,081
And we're going to come back to that too in a minute.

82
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:35,521
But what I think is that there are two utterly different reasons that he's going to give us.

83
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:44,641
And he doesn't have a very distinguished, I'll show you a place where he messes up, I think, right, in putting the two different ones together in one sense.

84
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:46,321
And what are the two different ones?

85
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:56,881
One is, coming up right now in italics, the entity which in each case we ourselves are is ontologically that which is farthest.

86
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:04,961
And remember, that goes back to Division I, that the being of Dasein is nearest and farthest away.

87
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:22,961
And that's the claim, I think, that the background of intelligibility has to be transparent and not something you can study, or not something you normally thematize, and not something you can ever completely thematize.

88
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:26,641
It helps to think of it as the illumination in the room.

89
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Just as the illumination isn't something you see, but it's that on the basis of which you are able to see things.

90
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:47,841
So, what Heidegger thinks is our understanding of being isn't something that you normally thematize and think about, but it's that in this famous word with that Vor Alf Hin, everything is intelligible.

91
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:53,041
Remember, being is that on the basis of which, that's the Voralfin, everything is understood.

92
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:09,281
And I'm saying the basis of which part of this is the background, and the background is pervasive and near, so pervasive and near that it's hard to talk about.

93
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:15,801
And it's covered up in that structural way.

94
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:18,040
And that's one of the meanings of falling.

95
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:32,921
Because so far, I'm just he hasn't said anything about why it's nearest or why what he wants to talk about is ontologically farthest away.

96
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,241
And he's going to go on now and say something that sort of goes in a different direction.

97
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:58,201
Our being amidst the things with which we concern ourselves most closely in the world, a being which is falling, guides the everyday way in which Dasein is interpreted and covers up ontically Dasein's authentic being, so that the ontology which is directed toward this entity is denied an appropriate basis.

98
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:07,081
That's still compatible with, you can't understand the background, the understanding of being.

99
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:15,801
Normally, you understand things and our vocabulary and our way of studying is directed at things.

100
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:25,321
And that's covering up our understanding of our being as we deal with particular beings.

101
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,801
And that's one meaning of falling.

102
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,481
Then a little further, the primordial way in which this entity is presented as a phenomenon is anything but obvious.

103
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:39,241
Even if even ontology approximately follows the course of the everyday interpretation of Dasein.

104
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,720
And now you begin to get this sort of violent language.

105
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:54,601
The laying bare of Dasein's primordial being must rather be wrested from Dasein by following the opposite course than taken by the falling ontico tendency of interpretation.

106
00:12:54,601 --> 00:13:07,681
Well, now falling is also fleeing, in which Dasein is motivated to cover up its structure.

107
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,721
I don't know, I haven't got a reference to the word fleeing yet, but it will come around.

108
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:31,040
Or if it doesn't, anyway, it has to be in there because if the cover-up is an attempt to hide something, I mean, there's two, there's what can what is hard to get a grip on because we don't have the right kind of concepts and so forth.

109
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:43,681
That's the structural story about how it is hard to do the, to have a theory of the back, an account, a phenomenological account of the structure of the background.

110
00:13:43,680 --> 00:14:00,080
That, I wouldn't call that a cover-up, but that he says that Dasein covers up its authentic being, and that you have to do violence to find it.

111
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,521
That's a fleeing story.

112
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:04,160
I mean, the ontological story isn't a cover-up.

113
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,041
It's just a structure that what is nearest is also farthest away, least accessible.

114
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,801
What is nearest and most pervasive is least acceptable.

115
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,521
That isn't a question of a cover-up.

116
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:24,881
And that's not a question, I wouldn't even want to say, of falling, though I think it has to come under his category of falling, as does absorption.

117
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:27,601
It's a very broad category.

118
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:45,160
But when you start saying that you've got to actually violently get to the truth about Dasein, that must be because Dasein is making a positive effort to fend off the it's, it's, and your, and you're Dasein, getting at the truth.

119
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:52,601
So you get this sort of, I mean, it's, I think, always in what he's doing.

120
00:14:52,601 --> 00:15:11,561
Look at the paragraph now that begins: Dasein's kind of being, we're still in 359, thus demands that any ontological interpretation which sets itself the goal of exhibiting the phenomena in their primordiality should capture the being of this entity in spite of this entity's own tendency to cover things up.

121
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,041
Now, that's a hiding and a fleeing story.

122
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,561
It's not a structural ontological story, I think.

123
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:22,761
It sounds too psychological, really.

124
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,961
I hate it.

125
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:39,881
I think the whole theme in Being and Time, that Dasein is actually involved in fleeing and covering up its structure, is what Foucault calls the hermeneutic of suspicion.

126
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:44,040
And I think Heidegger is an example of the hermeneutic of suspicion.

127
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,001
Foucault's got this nice category that covers Freud, Marx, and Heidegger.

128
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,440
That puts Heidegger in very bad company, it seems to me, ontologically, anyway.

129
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:56,761
And that's what he's doing right here.

130
00:15:56,761 --> 00:16:12,840
Because the hermeneutic of suspicion says that for some reason or other, human beings, each one, Freud and Marx and Heidegger have different arguments, are motivated to cover up the most important truth about what's going on.

131
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:26,040
And that the job of somebody studying human beings, whether Marxist, Freudian, or Heidegger, is to get at this deepest truth about human beings that's covered up.

132
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:46,481
And moreover, when you do get at it and can face it, it's liberating because a lot of the misery and distortion of social life or psychological life or just plain Dasein is caused by this tendency to flee and cover up.

133
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:57,521
So the job of somebody who believes in the hermeneutics of suspicion is to force people to face up to what it is they're motivated to hide.

134
00:16:57,521 --> 00:17:00,161
All of that I just wish Heidegger didn't have.

135
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,521
I don't think he needs it.

136
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:15,120
I think all he needs is the structural point that it's hard to do a phenomenology of a being whose basic structure is to be the basis of all intelligibility.

137
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,761
Okay, now you can say some things about this.

138
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:18,800
Yeah, Ariel.

139
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,681
What?

140
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:23,040
Well, I have figured out that he's confused.

141
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,360
Let me give you one more thing before you say something.

142
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,521
The clearest place where the confusion comes out, let's see, I just wrote confused in a page number.

143
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:35,921
I have to find where it follows in the normal development of things.

144
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,560
I don't know whether to look in here or to look at all of my marks.

145
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,521
It's going to be an anticlimax, I'm afraid, but I find it very interesting, confused, and confused.

146
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,120
Oh, here we are, okay, on page 363.

147
00:17:49,441 --> 00:18:04,800
Okay, now, what is distinctive, sort of almost exactly in the middle of the page, what is distinctive in common sense is that it has in view only the experiencing of factual entities in order that it may be able to rid itself of an understanding of being.

148
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,560
That's a fleeing story.

149
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,840
It's just trying to get rid of an understanding of being.

150
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,481
It fails to recognize that entities can be experienced factually only when being is already understood.

151
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,681
That's a structural point.

152
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:32,120
One of them is a kind of motivated cover-up, and the other one is, you know, failing to do something isn't like trying to get, failing to get rid of something.

153
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,840
It's not, failing, I'd have to find the right words not to beg the question.

154
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:44,521
You can't get rid of something without trying to cover it up, but you can fail to see it for just plain structural reasons.

155
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:47,721
And I'd so okay, now, yes, I'm not mixed up.

156
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:48,521
He's mixed up.

157
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:49,160
But go ahead.

158
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:56,840
Don't really, I realize I'm just a few years, and I haven't read that much higher, but I really don't like the notion of things.

159
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,920
I mean, the thread marks on the basis of the psychological.

160
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:01,481
I can't take it.

161
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,200
It's not like there's any like sort of psychological fault, but pushy if there's down or anything like that.

162
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:08,840
It's just sort of the way we fall in.

163
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:13,001
Yeah, one of the best statements of it is of all people, John Searle.

164
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:14,201
I would have brought it along.

165
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:18,920
He says, we are not normally in the business of dealing with the background.

166
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:22,521
We don't have the language to talk about the background.

167
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:29,560
And it's very hard to be able to get people to notice it without turning it into some object.

168
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,600
And the whole point is it's supposed to be not an object.

169
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,841
And I like that argument.

170
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,481
That's fine.

171
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:46,040
You don't have to attribute any sort of tendency to flee or cover up or what was this that I just had, whatever that word was.

172
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,241
What was it?

173
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,401
Get rid of.

174
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,001
You don't, it isn't as if there's anybody trying to get rid of anything.

175
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:54,921
Okay, well, you want to say something about this.

176
00:19:54,921 --> 00:20:09,840
Oh, you're really, you're a straight man for this, because one of my favorite objections to Heidegger is that he has no right to base the fleeing on the fact that Dasein is exposed to anxiety.

177
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,640
And why?

178
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,920
Well, that's interesting.

179
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:19,600
That's because in the end, Dasein, and this is again, it would be the structure of the hermeneutics of suspicion.

180
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,641
When Dasein finally holds on to anxiety, guess what?

181
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,241
It's joyful.

182
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:30,481
So in the end, it makes no sense to say that Dasein is always fleeing or tends to flee anxiety.

183
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,320
Why would he need to flee?

184
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,481
Remember, anxiety isn't painful.

185
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:37,920
It isn't sort of breaking out in a cold sweat and wringing your hands.

186
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:42,320
Anxiety is a sense of the sort of basic spookiness of everything.

187
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,160
And okay, go ahead.

188
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:44,720
That's right.

189
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:45,280
That's right.

190
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,481
I was trying to say.

191
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:47,280
Yes.

192
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,481
Yes.

193
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,201
Yeah.

194
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:52,721
But that just reintroduces the point.

195
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:55,441
Why should we be upset by ungroundedness?

196
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,680
I mean, this is a kind of Wittgensteinian point.

197
00:20:57,681 --> 00:21:08,001
I mean, it's only because we is it really true that we ask for the kind of ground that Descartes was asking for and Plato was asking for and that human beings all over need that kind.

198
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:15,521
Are the people in Bali suffering from the anxiety of groundlessness and rootlessness?

199
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:20,161
Or put it another way, once you accept groundlessness, you can lead a happy life.

200
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:24,880
You can get married and have children and climb Everest and do whatever you want.

201
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,400
You don't need grounds to lead a good life.

202
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:29,040
Yeah.

203
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,280
Okay, well, and then okay, then I'll okay, then I'll just put it into Western terms.

204
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:58,040
I mean, why uh should we think that ordinary people are suffering from this peculiar need to have grounds instead of just what well, but are they well that's what you'd have to think that they really are everybody really is Cartesian and and moreover that that and therefore not having grounds is very upsetting to them.

205
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:10,441
I mean Heider's got this sort of Wittgensteinian distinction between people who think that we're all grounded somehow and that there is in reason or nature or something the basic intelligibility that we can rely on.

206
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:19,721
Then there are the people who see that there isn't any basic intelligibility to rely on, and they think there's you've got to say it in German, they think instead of a grunt, there's an Avgrund.

207
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,080
An Avgrund is an abyss.

208
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,840
This is sort of a Sartrean thing.

209
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,841
It looks like, boy, there's no ground.

210
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:26,600
We are a feudal passion.

211
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,120
It's nihilism and terrible.

212
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,440
And then Heidegger says, why can't we just have an ungrundt, which is a non-ground?

213
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:35,641
And that's what I'm saying.

214
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,560
And why should we be fleeing the un-ground as if it were an abyss?

215
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:49,640
And the answer is, somehow, if it's the Cartesianism has invaded our culture, then he's got another problem.

216
00:22:49,640 --> 00:23:02,360
Because he says he's doing transcendental study about Dasein Uberhaupt, supposedly, not just Western post-industrial Dasein or something.

217
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,121
And so the problem occurs all over the place.

218
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,681
I just think fleeing is you never should have bought it.

219
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,320
It starts in the first hermeneutic of suspicion is Kierkegaard, I think.

220
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,481
But that's a long story.

221
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:19,241
Kierkegaard at least got an interesting story about what we're fleeing.

222
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:20,521
But go ahead.

223
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:25,721
Oh, yeah?

224
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,680
It seems right that he's been sort of planning and kind of defying the structure and saying that anxiety can be positive.

225
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:35,280
And yet that's what he thinks.

226
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,241
Yeah.

227
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,160
Anxiety is a good thing.

228
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:38,320
Yes.

229
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:44,320
Sense that there's a leveling involved that it's in us, that it's somehow not easy to do that.

230
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,321
And that it's much easier to have an average intelligibility and be part of Das Ma.

231
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,200
And that that's what most.

232
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:51,921
It's sort of why and why do people want to be take it easy?

233
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:55,761
I mean, there's some psychological motivation being smuggled in here.

234
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:58,560
And you could sort of push it around, but it shows up someplace.

235
00:23:58,961 --> 00:24:01,280
Very explicit is all the structural points that he makes.

236
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:14,320
But I really do think that smuggled in there is the sort of sense, like when you read the part on Das Ma, Either seems to have this negative attitude about leveling, even though he could never assert that it was somehow negative.

237
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:22,400
Well, the interesting thing is, I think, that he thinks that intelligibility is essentially leveling, and there's nothing wrong with leveling.

238
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:40,320
And that's again that he when he says authentic Dasein is always in the one, because there's no way you've got to have the one to have any way to do anything to get outside the concrete immediate situation into some generality and so forth.

239
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,800
So he's got to accept the one.

240
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:55,761
So then the issue comes again, then why this tone of shape up and you're fleeing into the one.

241
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:11,600
Why not just say, of course, the one has got to be there, but the one is something you also have to resist, but not in the sense of the you don't have to resist your tendency to flee into it.

242
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:27,080
You've just got to it's a complicated story, but I'll say it again, I say it often, work your way out of the one, not by getting more and more aphronomous like, getting more and more able to respond to the unique situation.

243
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:35,001
And even then, never completely, because there's always got to be this generality of the one in order to have anything intelligible.

244
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:42,521
And so now we get this question: why the motivation to what's the what's what's the bad motivation?

245
00:25:42,521 --> 00:25:47,080
It's to use the one to cover up our nature.

246
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:54,201
And now where I'm asking again, what what's this how does he explain this motive to use the one to cover up our nature?

247
00:25:54,201 --> 00:26:05,001
I mean, it you know, it looks like, well, it's because anxiety is terrible or groundlessness is terrible or resisting television and banalities and leveling is hard.

248
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:08,280
But none of it seems to make any it doesn't make any sense to me.

249
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,521
Yeah.

250
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:34,680
So the only difference between an inauthentic from the standard being an authentic one is that the inauthentic and fallen everything certainly you have to sort of work your way out of a kind of banality and a standard way of looking at things, which covers up what we are and everything covers up everything practically.

251
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:37,640
And now but the question is, wait, I just slipped my mind.

252
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,721
I have to get it back how I want to put it.

253
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:52,681
If you have to get out of that oh, I know, yes, but the idea that you have to you we have to use violence to get out of it and rest the people out of it.

254
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:58,521
Why don't you just I mean Wittgenstein manages to do a lot of this work without violence and without resting.

255
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:06,400
And it it only requires violence if the people are resisting the the the news you're bringing.

256
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:11,521
And that's what again I think he has no need or right to to say.

257
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:15,921
Once he points this out to us, we should all just say, yeah, that's how it is.

258
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:19,521
That's hard to see, but now that you point it out, I see it.

259
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:21,280
Well, that's that's a different issue.

260
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,481
We've got to put that aside.

261
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:30,640
I mean, how you get to be authentic is you should, I don't, you do it, whether you do it by Wilporn out is a deep point we're going to come to.

262
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,600
It's got to do with this choosing to choose issue.

263
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:43,840
How much in the background of what I'm talking about, there is going to be a problem about just how much receptivity and how much activity.

264
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,721
But not yet.

265
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:56,160
I mean, this is all I want to talk right now is, and I've done it, is just talk about that I don't think he's motivated the violence story.

266
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,160
Yeah, I guess Eric, I'm going to worry.

267
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:02,001
Go ahead, but be brief, folks.

268
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:17,681
It seems like maybe kind of just like stuff that hasn't made it in mind or hasn't streamlined it enough, and it's kind of stuck between your ontological statement, the whole world and story of the whole structural story, which is very fruitful and great.

269
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:19,921
And this like weird ethical statement that you're talking about.

270
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,041
Well, that's what I think.

271
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,720
Yeah, that's and he doesn't need it.

272
00:28:22,721 --> 00:28:29,280
And I don't even understand where he thinks he gets it because it sounds sort of haunted and psychological.

273
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,921
No, you guys are monopolizing this discussion.

274
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:33,121
Tyler wants to say something.

275
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:34,481
To what?

276
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,440
Okay.

277
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,001
Yeah, well, I thought you would think that, and I'm eager to hear what you have to say about it.

278
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:57,720
So at the startful level, there's a sort of fault, which is what fallen from the world decides to think of remote structure within which God is so far.

279
00:28:58,201 --> 00:28:59,560
So it has the sofa.

280
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,680
We take on basically some ordinary motivational structure, taking all the violence.

281
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,761
Which is which is what?

282
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,921
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

283
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,120
That's fine.

284
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:13,081
And that's a, isn't that interesting?

285
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,640
I like that.

286
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,521
But it's a funny thing.

287
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:16,201
It's a third angle.

288
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:23,560
Because it isn't a, I'm a fleeing, resisting, facing, but it isn't just structural.

289
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:31,401
It's, as you say, something like genetic, or I mean, I can't find the word, developmental.

290
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,800
Let's say it's developmental.

291
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:41,400
The way we grow up and get socialized has this built into it, that we are all going to want to do the standard thing.

292
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:47,001
But I'm not sure that.

293
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:48,521
Okay.

294
00:29:49,161 --> 00:29:49,561
Okay.

295
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:55,080
And this violence and resting on your version is that he just has to shake you up.

296
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:03,400
And he needs to shake you up because you're in the tranquility of saying, I already know how to do it, there's a standard way to do it, and so forth.

297
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:07,561
Okay, but it doesn't actually transform the motor structure.

298
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,481
So it doesn't mean that one is a main thing on one vessel.

299
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,840
Okay, so we have to change that structure.

300
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,800
And that's the violence that's going to happen.

301
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:27,320
Except that it's sort of in this book a kind of methodological violence, and that's not going to change anybody's structure.

302
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:36,001
So I'm happy if you all just have seen that there's a problem here and if anybody wants to write a paper about it, you're welcome to do it.

303
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:46,881
And I'd be shocked but interested to see an account that makes fleeing work or motivates the fleeing.

304
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:47,680
Yeah.

305
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,401
I think if nothing else, it remains compelled.

306
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:53,761
And it's dangerous, of course, the fact of the concept of that.

307
00:30:53,761 --> 00:31:04,160
But I mean, I think it's a lot imagined situations, say, where you know somebody and they're they're doing a lot of work along the regular subject and they're really caught up in the world of the work they're doing.

308
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,400
They can't find the answer to what they're doing.

309
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:07,680
And they're confused.

310
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:13,280
You look at that without making a value judgment at the time and saying, well, look, you know, you're really caught up in what's going on.

311
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,880
You haven't really considered that, you know, these terms that you're using, you know, the definitions are very vague.

312
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
You don't really understand what's going on.

313
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:26,241
The grounding that you think you have, with which you perform whatever you're doing, isn't really there.

314
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:29,121
And you tell this person this, and then you become very expensive.

315
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,241
And you get eggs.

316
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:32,880
And they're like, oh, you know, we can't just tell you what I'm doing.

317
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,080
Okay, but wait, that's enough.

318
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,241
I mean, because that's not going to be a cover-up.

319
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:39,841
The way you tell the story, that's a different issue again.

320
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,521
Yeah, you can explain why they resist what you're telling them.

321
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:44,640
And that's part of it.

322
00:31:44,640 --> 00:32:07,040
But the basic claim is that the whole way Dasein sets up the understanding of themselves and the world is to hide the fact that Dasein is ungrounded and to not have to experience the anxiety that comes with that realization.

323
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:17,960
And that and so and you're telling me all kinds of other stories about why Dasein d ca has trouble facing the structural things that Heidegger wants to describe.

324
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:48,440
And I just want to say, well, each one of them we could discuss on its own, but I think the least tenable of all of the candidates, the developmental and the perseverant one, and so forth, the least tenable is that it's built into Dasein structurally across the board that it's fleeing anxiety is the main motivation for why it has the wrong understanding of the world.

325
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:49,961
But I'm going to go on.

326
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:55,960
I mean, I would be very unhappy if I discovered that we've spent the whole day on this.

327
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:57,240
So let me see where I am.

328
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,401
There's a harmoneutic circle.

329
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:08,521
There's a whole lot of questions I just run through that I just don't think he's got he's answered satisfactorily.

330
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:15,321
Is why you believe anxiety reveals the truth that nothing has intrinsic meaning?

331
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:17,960
Why say that it's a basic disposiveness?

332
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:21,401
Does guilt really show that all our practices are ungrounded?

333
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:23,641
And what does that even mean?

334
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,560
And why, and let's see what else.

335
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,720
We have to start with the aurantical everyday understanding, but we have to get out of it.

336
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,121
So let me see, I'm skimming to get out of it here.

337
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:47,400
And we want to understand why there is this systematic cover-up that obscures the structure of our being.

338
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:59,841
Okay, and why isn't there enough cover-up just in the way the illumination in the room is, quote, not really covered up, but not easily accessible to us and describable?

339
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,601
So let's see.

340
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,120
So here we get to the violence on 359.

341
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:13,521
And so then we get finally to how can we know that the ontological understanding we've arrived at is phenomenally adequate?

342
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:22,001
That is, how can we ever know we're not just part of a cover-up and that there's any that you could ever get outside of it?

343
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:26,961
And now, then, Heidegger's, that's when we're back to formal indication.

344
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:36,800
The method for getting, if you're dealing with any kind of distortion, it doesn't really have to be a cover-up.

345
00:34:37,120 --> 00:35:00,400
But the way to deal with it, and if you're all in it, because you already have this forehaving, you're not working from outside, if you're in this hermeneutic circle, the only way to get out, not to get out of the hermeneutic circle, you don't want to do that, but to get clear about the structure from within the hermeneutic circle is formal indication.

346
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:11,840
What's sort of interesting is Heidegger wrote pages and pages about formal indication in his lecture notes, and the ones on religion have a big thing about it.

347
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:17,361
I could, if you want me to, you can ask me and I'll give you references.

348
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,441
And it's hardly visible in here.

349
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:23,681
And yet it does the crucial job.

350
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,160
And I just want to show you, the translation just covers it up, misses it.

351
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:36,881
Absolutely, probably the worst moment in the translation, it seems to me, is where he says at the top of 362.

352
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,201
No, that's not it.

353
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,441
361.

354
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,601
Yes, 361, middle of the page.

355
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:48,360
Look at this.

356
00:35:49,801 --> 00:36:01,560
How many realized that they just, when you read the sentence, you just read a mouthful of gibberish and didn't, and did you notice, or how you so, is it all so much like gibberish to you that it doesn't seem like any more than any other?

357
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:09,960
Look, in indicating the formal aspects of the idea of existence, that's the beginning of that, of the second full paragraph.

358
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:16,201
What in the world can that mean, indicating the formal aspects of the idea of existence?

359
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,560
Well, it doesn't mean anything.

360
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:34,200
The German just says, but in formally indicating existence, which is what he did remember way back at the beginning when he said we'll formally indicate God Zein as the being that's being is an issue for it, and we'll call that existence.

361
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:41,400
And it happens again at the bottom at that paragraph.

362
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:51,881
The idea of existence, which we have posited, gives us an outline of the formal structure of the understanding of Gasein and does so in a way, and that's also formal indicating.

363
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:55,161
But there's also a place.

364
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:07,481
Oh, I just want to say that Joan Stanban, I think that's nice because it's nice that I've always beating on Joan Stanbaugh, but this page is so much better than the translation.

365
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:15,001
It just says, her translation, our formal indication of the idea of existence was guided by the understanding of being, so forth.

366
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:18,201
And that's straightforward and right.

367
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:20,040
Okay, now, where am I?

368
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,000
I jumped there.

369
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:24,521
So this is, we have to, so how do we do it?

370
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:38,481
How do we find out, get the phenomena undistorted if for whatever reason, and now we're just putting this under the general category, never, I don't want to say it's covered up.

371
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:47,441
Not that there is a cover-up, just that our experience of the phenomenon of us and the world is distorted and covered up.

372
00:37:47,441 --> 00:37:48,961
What do we do about it?

373
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:52,321
Well, we use formal indication.

374
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:57,921
We assume, by the way, I worried once, which I want to, I understand now.

375
00:37:57,921 --> 00:38:07,361
I ask myself the question: how come Heidegger provisionally gets it right about Dasein when he gets it wrong about guilt and wrong?

376
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:11,121
I mean, Heidegger thinks that we all get it wrong.

377
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:20,161
Our whole shared understanding gets it wrong about guilt and death and the self, we'll see today.

378
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,560
And informal indication always has to start out with where things are wrong.

379
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:34,960
How come where the most important thing, Dasein, is at stake, he doesn't start out with something like, we're a rational animal, or a part of nature or something.

380
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:40,241
He jumps right in and tells you the real right answer.

381
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:48,400
Well, I always realize that's because he has written the book already, so to speak.

382
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:49,600
He knows the right answer.

383
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,961
But what puzzled me was: why then does he call it provisional?

384
00:38:55,361 --> 00:39:04,800
Why doesn't he just say, I know, and you will be convinced by the end of this book, that Dasein is the being whose being is an issue for it.

385
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,401
Well, I now see what's going on.

386
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:18,441
There are two sort of, he doesn't explain altogether what, what's going on, but one, he's understood that we are a being whose being is an issue for it.

387
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:22,921
But what's provisional is that that's our essential structure.

388
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:32,521
He hasn't, something is provisional, and if he hasn't shown it, and he won't have shown it till the end of the book, what would he be showing?

389
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:49,880
Well, that if you take us to be the being whose essence, if you take if you believe that Dasein has an essence, and you take its essence to be that it takes a stand on its being, then you can explain all the other phenomena.

390
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:51,720
That's the test for the essence.

391
00:39:51,720 --> 00:40:05,401
I mean, the essence of gold, if it's 79, explains the ductility and the malleability and the yellowness and the conductivity and everything about gold, every causal property of gold.

392
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:13,080
And in a similar way, if he gets it right about the essence of Dasein, then all the other stuff in here has got to be following from it.

393
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:19,721
And explain, it worked out as our structure.

394
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,161
And that's what he thinks.

395
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:28,280
He thinks that he knows what's he provisionally, one of the things we do is take a stand on our being.

396
00:40:28,281 --> 00:40:30,521
And he's just observed that.

397
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,681
But what he wants is to show that we have an essence and that's our essence.

398
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,800
And so I just wanted to say that because for me that sort of helps a little understand how.

399
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:54,441
Unlike, see what I'm saying is, unlike all the other forms of formal indication that he's got, why, yeah, you want to close it?

400
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:56,040
Good idea.

401
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,521
Is it the noise or the draft or both?

402
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,240
Okay.

403
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:12,321
So he gets the formal indication on 361, even though thanks to the translation you can't see it.

404
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:21,040
And he's, and he helps us understand something on 362, which is a confusion.

405
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,921
What is it?

406
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:25,441
Oh, yeah, this is just the next point.

407
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,721
I'm not deriving anything from that point.

408
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,361
But it's related.

409
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,321
The essence of Dasein is its existence.

410
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:41,040
And now I want to just talk about this fact that he's using this term existence.

411
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:51,601
Existence is the name for a way of being for which its being is an issue for it.

412
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,040
That's why we study these existentials.

413
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,601
Now there's something that's going to sort of disturb you.

414
00:41:58,001 --> 00:41:59,680
And it disturbed Heidegger finally.

415
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,240
He realized he was confused.

416
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,641
At the top of 362, and it's all over the place.

417
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:18,481
He talks about a threefold distinction of existence, facticity, and fallen.

418
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:28,401
And all over the place, you will find that existence is his name for the future projective dimension.

419
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:31,521
But existence is also his name for the whole structure.

420
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,560
That is, that's the way of being of Dasein.

421
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Well, that always annoyed me.

422
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:46,201
And one day I discovered, thanks to the fact that the footnotes are in the Stanbaugh translation, but now I have to find where it is.

423
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:48,280
315.

424
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:52,281
It's right at this point where he writes something in the margin.

425
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:57,961
So that means in the German 315 in the margin, I marked it.

426
00:42:57,961 --> 00:42:59,401
Oh, here it is.

427
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,321
No, it isn't.

428
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:12,521
Yes, he notices and he writes existence, one, for the whole of being of Dasein, and two, only for understanding.

429
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:15,321
Understanding is the projecting dimension.

430
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:18,200
And so he realizes that he should have used two different terms.

431
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:19,240
He certainly should have.

432
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:26,200
Existence is a nice term for Dasein, and it had the way of being of Dasein, and existentialism is already around.

433
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:33,080
Kierkegaard has defined himself as an existential thinker, and doing these existentialias all very well.

434
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,521
Then you need a new word for the future directedness.

435
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:43,721
One of the words is understanding, but we need a bigger, more, a broader category, more abstract.

436
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,640
And I don't have any proposal.

437
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,921
That's his problem.

438
00:43:46,921 --> 00:44:00,281
But you have to realize when you come across the term existence, that it almost always means the future dimension of Dasein's activity, projection.

439
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:11,481
And that, but of course, when you come across existentials, that always means the threefold structure of thrown, falling, and projecting.

440
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:12,120
Okay, I don't know.

441
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:13,560
There's nothing to discuss there.

442
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,961
We just have to sort it out and go on.

443
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,641
Let's see now.

444
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:23,001
And now we're back to the hermeneutic circle, which he didn't name before.

445
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:23,680
I named it.

446
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,560
On 362.

447
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,521
You get the whole hermeneutic circle going by again.

448
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:37,441
And you get it carefully sort of wrapped around formal indication this time.

449
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:49,121
The middle, the second paragraph, he says, This understanding is, he's talking about understanding Dasein's being.

450
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:58,721
This understanding is to be grasped primordially only on the basis of a primordial interpretation of Dasein in which we take the idea of existence as our skew.

451
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,361
There, I take it existence as opposed to being taking a stand on your being.

452
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:12,801
Does it not then become altogether patent in the end that this problem of fundamental ontology, which we broached, is one in which we move in a circle?

453
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:16,001
And there we are, where that's the hermeneutic situation.

454
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:17,040
So we go on a little.

455
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,640
We have indeed already shown in analyzing the structure of understanding that so and so it moves in a circle.

456
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,361
That was that quick run through of the four structure in division one.

457
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:40,001
In spite of this, if the problematic of fundamental ontology is to have its hermeneutic situation clarified, our investigation must now come back explicitly to this circular argument.

458
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:50,801
When it's objected that the existential interpretation is circular, it said that we have presupposed the idea of existence, and that Dasein gets interpreted accordingly, so the idea of being may be obtained from it.

459
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:57,360
But then it turns out, and we don't have to read it all, that that's the way things work.

460
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:05,601
You've got to stay inside, and you've got to do formal indication to do hermeneutics.

461
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:15,880
The one place that comes out, and I think it's nice to see how that hangs together, is the bottom of 362 in the italics, which are, of course, completely mistranslated, so you can't see it.

462
00:46:13,361 --> 00:46:17,720
But I will read it so you will see it.

463
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:23,560
Skimming down, starting so that it may decide of its own accord.

464
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,001
Where do we have to start?

465
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:40,680
We want to let that which is to be interpreted be put into words so that it, Dasein, may decide of its own accord whether, as the entity which it is, it has the state of being in terms of which it should be.

466
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,160
It's always the getting the Voralfin wrong.

467
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:53,881
So the state of being in terms of which it has been disclosed in the projection with regard to its formal aspects.

468
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:57,801
No, it's been disclosed in formal indication.

469
00:46:57,801 --> 00:47:04,921
I mean, so there you can just see that that's the method you've got to use when you're in a hermeneutic circle.

470
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:12,361
It's in the German you can see formal and on its formal and formal and seigen Erschlossen.

471
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:14,441
That's no formalen onseigen.

472
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:18,601
Yeah, that's form formal indication is what you're doing.

473
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:24,040
So now we're in the hermeneutic circle and it does that and that it needn't be violent.

474
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,881
I'm just summarizing where I am.

475
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:35,960
And so we're back to fleeting again and the cover-up story.

476
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,801
I just wanted to show you that it's coming up again on 368.

477
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:48,760
'Cause when I mentioned it I hadn't I didn't go directly to the fleeing quote 'cause I didn't know where it was 'cause I put it later in my lecture.

478
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,161
Here, I'm in the middle of 368.

479
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:58,881
The everyday interpretation of the self, it's going to do it, we're going to do it with a self, has a tendency to understand itself and terms of the world with which it's concerned.

480
00:47:58,881 --> 00:48:00,000
Now, that's fine.

481
00:47:58,441 --> 00:48:05,280
Nobody wants to say that we, that's the John Searle version, which is all you need.

482
00:48:06,321 --> 00:48:14,560
When Dasein has itself in view onto, it fails to see itself in relation to the kind of being of that entity, which is itself.

483
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,001
That's fine.

484
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:19,120
What is the motive for this fugitive way of saying I?

485
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:25,921
It is motivated by Dasein's falling, for as falling, it flees in the face of itself into the one.

486
00:48:25,921 --> 00:48:30,880
Okay, so there, that's the right way it says 322 in the margin.

487
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:34,721
Now, I'm not quite ready to get to the self yet, though.

488
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,560
I'm going to get there in just a minute.

489
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:41,201
On 363, you know, we still have to look at something.

490
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:55,601
Oh, well, that's the one I showed you, where they get rid of an understanding of beings and fail to recognize an understanding of being are put side by side in a way I don't think they should be.

491
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,721
Common sense misunderstands understanding.

492
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,600
That's sure.

493
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:05,121
That's because we normally cope with the kind of things that you understand as things.

494
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:13,601
But therefore, common sense must necessarily pass off as violent, anything that lies beyond the reach of his understanding.

495
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:24,241
There is always this thing that because the fleeing is lurking in this trap, in this paragraph, so is the violence.

496
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,681
So, Heidegger, one of my things, and this is what I listen to.

497
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:36,160
So, this is how this is Heidegger explaining how we're going to get to the phenomenon when it's covered up and so forth.

498
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,601
And the first point I was making was formal indication.

499
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:51,080
And now I've got a point: our pre-ontological understanding of being is on grounded, according to Heidegger, motivates a tendency to flee, which in turn justifies not taking Dasman at face value.

500
00:49:51,961 --> 00:50:08,120
This sort of just, I think this justifies formal indication, I mean, in Heidegger's picture, because guilt as something you owe is covering up the fact that it's not a question of owing at all, but not getting behind your thrownness.

501
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:17,401
Death as an event at the end of your life covers up the fact that dying is something you're doing all the time, and so forth.

502
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:19,241
And why is this all happening?

503
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,120
Because there is a tendency to flee and into Dasman.

504
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:41,881
Therefore, not only is Dasman too general and banal and standard to get at the real unique situation, it also doesn't have a clue as to how to deal with Dasein.

505
00:50:41,881 --> 00:50:54,441
And Heidegger's explanation of that is that in order to flee ungroundedness, Dasein flees into Dasman, and Dasman has a view of us as objects.

506
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,201
Let me see if I can.

507
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,040
There's more to say about that.

508
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,321
I don't think so.

509
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:06,761
And Das and Heidegger, now the final point is: I'm still asking, how does Heidegger get to the phenomenon?

510
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,480
Well, Heidegger experiences anticipatory resoluteness.

511
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:12,761
He's authentic.

512
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:20,121
I mean, how you get to be authentic, I haven't talked about yet, whether you do it by willpower or by grace or whatever.

513
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:38,241
But Heidegger's clearly sees the phenomenon, and therefore he's in a position to break out, I think, would be better, the ordinary way of doing thinking about it, telling us his way.

514
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:43,040
And this leads to something I want to get clear.

515
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,960
Well, first, there's the problem of wholeness.

516
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:46,240
So, what happens here?

517
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:53,441
He does see the whole, starting right below 64.

518
00:51:53,441 --> 00:52:00,400
Through the unity of the items which are constituted for care, look at this now, the same puzzle, you know, that he should have fixed.

519
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:02,800
Existentiality, facticity, and fallenness.

520
00:52:02,801 --> 00:52:08,080
There, it's quite clear that he's using the term in a different way than he should.

521
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:14,961
It has become possible to give the first ontological definition for the totality of Dasein's structural whole.

522
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:20,080
So, now he's got the story of Dasein's structural whole.

523
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,161
Remember, now this is just me trying again to justify my reordering.

524
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:33,681
The issue at the beginning of Division II was we haven't got Dasein's structural whole, and we have to do all kinds of things to fix that.

525
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:40,080
But we've already got existentiality, facticity, and fallenness all over the place in Division I.

526
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:45,201
Then, so what else do you get when you get the structural whole?

527
00:52:45,521 --> 00:52:47,840
Well, I don't really know.

528
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:57,361
It's obviously what you get when you get, when you're authentic and you get the authentic totality.

529
00:52:57,361 --> 00:53:00,881
This is what he's talking about at the top of 364.

530
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:09,361
By exhibiting anticipatory resoluteness, we have brought Dasein before us with regard to its authentic totality and with it with authentically whole.

531
00:53:09,361 --> 00:53:14,681
There must be some kind of inauthentic whole so that we now have it in advance.

532
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:25,641
The authenticity of the potential, the ability to be a self guarantees the primordial existentiality, guarantees that primordial existentiality is something we see in advance.

533
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:34,760
He's still getting, whoever wants to write a paper on the hermeneutic, there's, you know, seeing in advance is the fours issues, the four sight.

534
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:47,321
He keeps using the terminology of the threefold aspects of hermeneutics just without signaling that he's doing anything special with it.

535
00:53:47,321 --> 00:53:49,961
Partly because I don't think there's anything interesting about it.

536
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:51,961
I mean, he's just pushing it in here.

537
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,961
But why there are these.

538
00:53:54,040 --> 00:54:02,121
I never understood why there are these three, four having, four sight, and four conception, why there couldn't be four or two.

539
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,680
But they do a good job these three.

540
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:06,521
I bet you could think of another one.

541
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:13,161
But anyway, the three are supposed to map onto the temporality structure, presumably.

542
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,321
All right, no, I don't really know.

543
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:16,600
That's another paper topic.

544
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,121
He never tells us that they do, and I don't know if they do.

545
00:54:20,361 --> 00:54:26,921
The past, let's try it, is something like the four-having, because the past is the always already.

546
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:29,160
He's already built that into the care structure.

547
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:39,881
So that what you are, what you're always already in, the four-sight will have to be the present, alongside entity.

548
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:41,320
That's very far ahead.

549
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,961
And the future one is going to be the four conceptions.

550
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:48,680
Why, why you know, I I give up.

551
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,040
No, you can't do it.

552
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,160
I can't do it anyway.

553
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,960
Map it onto the threefold temporal structures.

554
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:55,961
So, let me go back to where I was.

555
00:54:55,921 --> 00:55:11,681
The the so now the problem of wholeness has got to be something more than just knowing this structure, it's got to be, I take it, actually experiencing fully what it is to be a thrown, falling, projecting being.

556
00:55:12,001 --> 00:55:20,080
And though he had the wholeness all along, he didn't have it in its richness or something is one of the words he uses.

557
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:31,361
But pilots ask the five senses I think you know, I just richness or best the market's working.

558
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,800
Yeah, I think so.

559
00:55:32,801 --> 00:55:39,361
You Deli or I think that's right, but let's think about why that is.

560
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,001
What does he say that even?

561
00:55:42,001 --> 00:55:42,961
I don't remember.

562
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:51,280
Well, he could okay would be because he realized the structure to just give us care as being ahead of his development.

563
00:55:51,441 --> 00:55:54,800
Seems to preclude an existential identity that he could never
