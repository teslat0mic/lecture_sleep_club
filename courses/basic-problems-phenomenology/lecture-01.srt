1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,039
And it it starts with the discussion of death, and which is the sort of ultimate most extreme form of experiencing a design.

2
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,999
Then it goes back to guilt, which is a language form.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,199
Then it goes to conscience for you, something in it just all over the place.

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,959
And why does it begin with death?

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,599
Because somehow Heidegger pumps up his problem that have we got the whole book on it in our forehead.

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,200
And he asked me, No, of course you haven't.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,519
Then why did you have it in the no?

8
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:43,039
How about I could you just open the book of the family of content sort of carelessly with whatever explosion is the amendment.

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,640
In fact, I'll give you had a book that there's many books, but I'm going to tell you what worked because I knew I really have to address this one.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:01:10,680
Why the quote was parallels in individual minds, throwing this always comes before Hosea only asked because throwing us as what we are already have to do with what we're pressing into in a serious way.

11
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:20,279
The past doesn't want to all come before the future, even so on 172.

12
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:27,399
And remember, all I'm trying to do is convince anybody who's skeptical that I've got a better plan for this negative.

13
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:31,640
I claim about which anybody might well be skeptical.

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
Well, I have to convince you.

15
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:55,960
Okay, so if you look on 172, where he starts to talk about the structure of Hosea, he does it by starting with the state of mind, that is disposable, that is within the space, and then having done the state of plan, he gets to the next thing, which is to do understanding once on 188.

16
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,319
That's the way it makes sense to do it.

17
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,320
Now, what is going on in 170?

18
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:09,480
Well, there's a topic of 174 and he starts laying out the relationship with throwing them to understanding.

19
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:20,279
Who says, and he starts out explaining that he's going to talk about throwing this, which is where he gets thrown from the beginning, being through there.

20
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:23,160
And funny guess that thank you.

21
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,879
I'm just trying to tell you after all throwing us into live or over, because trust me know that.

22
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,119
Oh, I'm going back to 172.

23
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:37,759
So when he talks first about that disposing was right to be a human.

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:54,080
And then he goes on, as I said, to talk about drawings and that they go together the anthropoprimordial table, but he also lines up the hook in the order he does.

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:05,199
I mean, there is not in a kind of circular relation that since the understanding affects the group or the children of the children affects what possibilities you press into.

26
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:20,399
You could sort of do it either way, but the natural thing is to take where you started, throw it into the world already, and put that before the standard and play on it, which is the understanding part.

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,360
So that and put the path before the repeat, but that's not how he does it in the food.

28
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,159
On page 11, that would take a front.

29
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,879
He does on 168 the temporality of the understanding and then the temporality of stable.

30
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:57,680
I think he does it because he led what it is to the fact that he started with death, which is got to do with getting into the deeper and understanding, and then he dealt with guilt, okay and so forth.

31
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,319
So now so he's consistent in the data.

32
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,880
But he isn't.

33
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:13,040
That I think is evidence that he doesn't know what he's there's sort of various different digressive levels of his manuscript that he suddenly ended in.

34
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:27,559
Because on 275, I was just looking through the days, he many surprises where he didn't work, but on 275, for instance, he thought by five lines four adding and then four sides and fourth instead.

35
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,840
That's been the piece of it, then the order they're on and always in division one.

36
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,040
And but why did he switch that?

37
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,439
Why not take the same problem?

38
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,800
Oh, yeah, okay.

39
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:47,559
On 326, here's sort of something kind of about raising about two ways.

40
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,279
Having taken up this first, I'm assuming you know that this is the way you're looking here.

41
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,119
Yes, that's what you've got in speech.

42
00:04:54,119 --> 00:05:00,679
On 311, you've got to do the less the where you've got your visitors.

43
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:16,280
You see, because of course, no, the first chapter of division two is depth, and the second chapter is resoluteness, and the middle of the second chapter is 58, and that's a crazy way of organizing it.

44
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,360
Lo and behold, the one is 66.

45
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:23,239
He does it in the other world, the right way.

46
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,640
This is 20 lines from the bottom.

47
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:33,319
He says, All oncology all on the line is going to just be different to such phenomena and you don't say this, but make up your mind items.

48
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,159
Why not make this field?

49
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,000
If that's how you go to write your book, he doesn't he has a great together.

50
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,840
Okay, so that's my argument for that.

51
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:50,200
But the right way is to put your first, not only because, but it's also wrong here.

52
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:58,760
Because yes, there's a more random guilt, which also has a kind of play in the radar.

53
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,160
And it isn't not such a it isn't such an extremely form of dung.

54
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,639
And so that's part of the problem.

55
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,760
And that related what I think is really confusing.

56
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,760
So far it sounds for having said to me probably emerging briefly.

57
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,679
But that is really important to pedagogical issues.

58
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,199
You'll see it when you you don't have to go through all the suffering I want to do and everybody else really in the order you publish it.

59
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,480
Because you forgave him.

60
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:35,840
I think if you imagine how it is, you can see how confusing it is when you see how you behave.

61
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:44,959
Because in the face of guilds, for example, you have red faces, you have anticipatory.

62
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:52,080
Resoluteness is a lesser form of authentic activity than anticipatory.

63
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,960
Resoluteness and then possibly bills.

64
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:01,440
And resoluteness, then you keep getting told that having resoluteness, this isn't really the whole thing.

65
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,840
The whole thing is only apparent and death.

66
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,839
Well, you wonder why you have to feel it that way, right?

67
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,600
Just do it.

68
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,640
And then one of the other things, which makes it even more whatever.

69
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:21,439
And that when you do it my way, you do bill, time, and resolution.

70
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,679
And resoluteness, and it's as inclusive, you I'll give you a quote.

71
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:31,040
And for authentic resolution, well you ought to do that next.

72
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,239
And if you read it my way, it it's pedagogical, yes, that doesn't make sense much.

73
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,679
Why this why did why they used to do it that way?

74
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:59,720
And uh, for instance, on just one example in K49, I want to show you this, and 154 resolutions become more forward, more pioneering, more and more dealers, just plain resolutions, and you would think you would start with the general number, and we walk to the hardest, the more complicated way.

75
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:16,920
That was your NIPA now gotten to you've got to make this move a certain you've got to keep mechanism of a plane resolution is in point towards.

76
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,880
It started half there in its understanding.

77
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,000
So he's saying this resolution is a home point forward, and take it as well.

78
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,679
If I told you, X points toward Y, which do you think comes first in the guy's book?

79
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,520
You say you have the thing point towards the X would point toward Y, and then the Y they point towards.

80
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,720
Now you're this one.

81
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,280
Never anybody was appointed.

82
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,400
And the order in which I think it makes sense, got hold on here, and so you both dispose the idealized.

83
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,480
Now that's the same and 11.

84
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,400
I'll just use these numbers to test.

85
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,560
Roman numeral two is one.

86
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,439
Let me just go.

87
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:03,720
I call it error one, just so I go the resolution in number two.

88
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Then comes this.

89
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:12,440
That's so the setup, so the staff of Roman numeral one is the mile paradigm.

90
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:23,559
Then we finally put the thing together as a whole in section Roman English three, numbers 62, which goes without anticipatory.

91
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:30,840
And then you've got the whole picture almost, although really, you have to go over and grab historicality.

92
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:41,360
And it'll be founded on the whole 55 and it's gone through a whole hand of friends discussion from the reality and remapped all the time.

93
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:55,119
How temporality is beyond people can free the last part.

94
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,400
Really number two.

95
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,960
All of the most are lost to them.

96
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,200
Once you've done that, you then map all the feet that you fix.

97
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:03,999
Are you with me?

98
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is I bossed everything.

99
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:14,960
Why did I try to add another four?

100
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:27,040
So I'm going to say one, two, three, then four.

101
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:32,640
Then finally you're going to say boss where you've got five five.

102
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:44,720
Then four six seven over oh my god yeah that's nothing but then we seven.

103
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,600
I think that's it.

104
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,160
Do we try to read anything I said previously?

105
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,439
I now have anywhere on the fourth.

106
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:55,199
I didn't quite like me to change up if you had if you want to see it.

107
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:58,880
Put it up there, but uh I don't agree it's no much.

108
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,320
Are you all having trouble thinking?

109
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,599
Bunch of people having trouble going to one six.

110
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:10,400
One, three, five, four, six, six.

111
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,279
It's there.

112
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,280
That's what I gotta do.

113
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,400
You got to make it work.

114
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,920
Okay, that now.

115
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,800
That's the end of that, which is, I'm never going to talk about that again.

116
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,920
Why I was finding it gives you things why I'm doing it.

117
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,520
Yeah, there's two things you can look for and do.

118
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:31,880
I'm sure I haven't seen all of them.

119
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,800
And I would like to have some.

120
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:41,400
Every time you see the order, those three other, I think that's why sometimes they're closer and anyway.

121
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:50,599
These kind of pairs, which I presume after a semester, you got used to, which are always, they would give you steel in either direction.

122
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:14,040
The more interesting one, which I began to map out, but I didn't want to bring it in today because it'll make much more sense for you, but that's a phenomenon, is how many ways the resolutions somehow leave up to his keyboard, or you can control anticipatory.

123
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:22,040
We rethink that, because it starts with, well, this resolution somehow must be something else beyond that or something.

124
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,520
So they have to keep telling you, well, resolution is really something we've got to anticipatory.

125
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:29,800
So keep me close to it.

126
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,439
Yeah, I found about ten such places.

127
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:33,400
Maybe I found them all.

128
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:40,999
Now, where you go on to the next, all this formal stuff, I'm sorry to say, you have to get out of the way.

129
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,520
You're good then.

130
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,879
We will get into the content of what is coming.

131
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,160
The next thing on my list is formal indication.

132
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,520
Really, that was another thing I didn't know.

133
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,599
You can't take any stance out of what he has to say about guilt and death.

134
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:02,440
You don't understand it was all done to the method of phenomenal indication.

135
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:14,880
Remember, phenomenal gifts is always finding some provisional way of describing and then investigating those.

136
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,520
And almost always I'm getting we'll for you, maybe next time.

137
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Phenomenal indications always start out when it's property what he's talking about.

138
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,040
Not always.

139
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,120
But descriptive what he's talking about is the dead wrong.

140
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:47,280
And you can be almost sure that the first way you pick up whatever it is we're trying to describe is, from a kind of point, not only dead wrong, but those days in the scripture, it's got cover up.

141
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,880
This is one step beyond Christian and Richard's designation.

142
00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:00,240
But Scripture doesn't think they're golden and easy for you by showing what they realize.

143
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,080
This is the way they did the R.

144
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,400
But Heidi thinks that guilt, well, that's the only two I'm sure.

145
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,679
Those are the big ones.

146
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:16,560
Anyway, they're going to show up that when you probably try to describe it, you're going to be in the R, you're going to be sure that that's going to come out to be flat.

147
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,880
It's only not finding right.

148
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,160
It's going to be 180 degrees wrong.

149
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,240
It's going to cover up what's really going on.

150
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,320
And moreover, that's why it's over.

151
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:30,160
It's not going to be a business department.

152
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:44,319
And why you have to do guilt first is because guilt is the clearest by the time of the interview is so hard for me to discontinue what where the the ontological right understanding goes down.

153
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:46,240
And they keep your eye on it.

154
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,679
You can beast being looking for it, what you would ask yourself.

155
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,120
What's the really wrong description?

156
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,400
And how is it 180 degrees?

157
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,720
What is the right description?

158
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,760
And how is it once you have the right description, you can understand that the other was the wrong description?

159
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,400
You'll see that so clearly in the guilt gap.

160
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,080
I'm going to explain it today.

161
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:14,280
And then, find the fault, you'll have to find our way to the point too.

162
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:15,719
Where are we?

163
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:32,280
So you remember that the formal and behavioral, by the way, I think when I talked about it, last I talked about it, didn't I really designate good?

164
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,400
You know, he was an answer.

165
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:55,000
But on 274, Sun Moon, because it's a move about formal indication, that the name of formal indication, which is a little bit off, the provisional sort of guess that you did, turns out to be a mighty.

166
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:05,079
If I were going further, it would like anyway, if I were doing it, I'm just saying he doesn't introduce God's body.

167
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:15,879
Because he says we're formally, here he does on page 274, we're going to formally indicate God's own as the being is being of nature first.

168
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,280
You see that already beginning of provision one.

169
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:32,800
But when we came to our, and we conferred back to it, when we came to our analysis of this video, it was look at our pre-market system, this interface, that's the provisional.

170
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,679
We designate it as the essence of diaspora.

171
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,640
This term is just formally indicated.

172
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:41,280
That means we don't really believe it yet.

173
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,040
So we're going to give it a try.

174
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,280
At least trace out what we want to talk about.

175
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:51,439
Formally indicates for God's art gives you the good units to be proof of God being itself.

176
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:56,479
You see, his problem his problem is he wants to tell you the right answer provision.

177
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,280
That's really the method we would require just to tell you the wrong answer.

178
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,920
The answer is always the answer would have to be something like the right answer.

179
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,559
Well, you should do that with God's mind.

180
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,760
But then that would make sense.

181
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,599
We got a serious problem there.

182
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,800
I don't know how to help it.

183
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,399
Because it would make it hard enough to understand the book without being given lateral stuff.

184
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,800
It's an issue for it.

185
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,479
But here's how it would go.

186
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,919
It would say, we want to talk about human beings in here, and we're going to provisionally call human beings rational animals.

187
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,359
And then we're going to discover that one of the people insufficient.

188
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,119
They're not rational at all, and they're really not animals at all.

189
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,280
All we're going to say is we're going to describe the structure of God of a being, and we want to know its nature.

190
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,879
And it's not impassive, and it isn't just a temple.

191
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:53,280
It's nature like plants and animals, and we're trying to find out what that is.

192
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,919
And then, of course, we'll find out there that's wrong.

193
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:32,599
But it would be so reducing the truth that I'm doing just to show you that there's a student realizing all the way that hermeneutic system works is found to be something which in its everyday manifestation, which is the only thing that God would describe, is bound to be not primordial, not authentic, not disclosing of what is, just followed from the bodies that is believed that everything you discover, what you discover important about God, but what is giving you the wrong answer?

194
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:38,119
I maybe about to get to reading my notes, that he's doing formally a pretty clear reason.

195
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:57,800
When I just don't believe in doing what I get done, and these even coming close to that bottom of the screen, fifteen lines up, all ontological investigations of such phenomena as real conscious today must start with what the everyday interpretation because Dawson has fallen as this kind of being.

196
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,639
The way Dasine gets interpreted is for the most part inauthentically oriented and doesn't be suggestive.

197
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,639
It doesn't all have formal indication.

198
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:07,719
It's just not using the term.

199
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,040
Or to Daseine, a primordial, appropriate ontological way of orienting questions were named clearly.

200
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:21,719
So you're going to but whatever we but whatever we speak as to the primordial ideas of the subject, then it's not like 30.

201
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,839
And it isn't as if being something yellow.

202
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,000
Even though it isn't we covered that up by calling the beings.

203
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:44,520
But if it is true, that if it isn't the case, that the long story about the long story about your anyway, Dawson has it the wrong story is always a motivated colour.

204
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:57,240
Then it's true that when you go get that home with the wrong thing, you've already got a clue or something that if something is revealed about the phenomenon, the way they say, and and why they do it, as you'll see.

205
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,160
And that's that paragraph is really telling you that this is going to be formally.

206
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:05,040
Maybe they're in the journal.

207
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:13,599
I once went through here and discovered about half the time later calls formally, something like ingredients that is there.

208
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,079
Now, it's like, you know, it's the same point again.

209
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:16,719
I'm going to read it.

210
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,879
He said everything we do.

211
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:28,079
He I'm just going to say not only is it wrong about God's mind or Prescard like say John Searle, that what would it be?

212
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,840
They're all kinds of wrong in ways of the provision in the Greek primordial.

213
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,159
It just occurs to me, well, of course, temporal value too.

214
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,600
Now, example, we've got a view of time as a sequence of moments which is measured by a clock.

215
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,359
It's not primordial.

216
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,480
It's it's way, way left behind to the primordial phenomena every day.

217
00:20:51,440 --> 00:21:01,280
So again, he never said that, I don't think, because I don't know, but I never look, I wonder if he does anything like the provisional thing that he's doing the provisional.

218
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,760
I mean he's five, so I don't know where but he could be, I mean he could be, he could say it, but that's what he's doing.

219
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,880
So let's see, I'm going to read the first paragraph of 341.

220
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:13,439
This is my last method why I do both.

221
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,479
I'm stopping writing to get the grill because we have a solar I'm supposed to go regularly.

222
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,040
Behold, my word ready fun.

223
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,359
I can't resist getting there for I'm going to work with them.

224
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:43,199
Anyway, we will say the first whole paragraph on 341, we must first show how the only phenomenon with which the ordinary interpretation is infamiliarity, going back to the primordial meanings of all the causal consciousness, when they are understood in a way that is on ordinary understanding.

225
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,559
There's another one on the list.

226
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:48,520
Our ordinary understanding of the call of conscience follows.

227
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,399
Totally and thoughtfully, 100%, 190 degrees wrong.

228
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,239
Just to give you a clue about what that must mean.

229
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:07,079
Everyday people, us, think that conscience is some kind of voice that calls us and tells us what to do, gives us moral advice, told us when we've done something wrong.

230
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:13,879
All of that, that's all, you'll see the quotes in the lab, the voice of the one.

231
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,679
Real conscience doesn't say anything.

232
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,319
And it doesn't call you to do anything, and it doesn't expose you to do anything.

233
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,520
It's different.

234
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:33,639
And it's so pretty, real conscience, that of Redoff with this everyday story of what they are and when he violates them.

235
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:36,919
So when he's clearing that, that he's going to respond to you.

236
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,919
He's not going to find the ordinary interpretation.

237
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:41,719
He's going to be God is not an authority quote.

238
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,399
You must then show that the ordinary interpretation brings the limitations of the way God finds them.

239
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,719
That's the overday problem.

240
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,240
We inspire.

241
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,800
And since the law belongs to Carrot Health, you are showing by no means accidental.

242
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,719
That's what we have to cover up.

243
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,639
It's not right.

244
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:00,839
It's obvious.

245
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:15,800
That's the key that's not as but it's so accident that the fact is wrong in the way it's prescribed because of us something anxious negative and hard to understand and hard to live with the ordinary conception.

246
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,760
Well, let anybody who wants to say anything.

247
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:24,919
Everybody doesn't wait to find out where he's trying to wait for that for decades under the cycle of moral involvement.

248
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,839
Okay, let me think of it.

249
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,399
I think the answer to the question is here putting two things in the same.

250
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,520
Anything about the concept?

251
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:40,079
Basically, well, except it's it could be a moral it could be at least getting confusiness.

252
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,679
Because there is a strong and simple statement.

253
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,600
The guideline is basically a moral relativism.

254
00:23:50,159 --> 00:24:04,640
If there's a culture which is not relative, which is through all guides, with all the rules with your Bible or whatever your culture is, telling you what about morality is and yes, why?

255
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,719
I haven't really answered too hard.

256
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,119
That's not even fun.

257
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,600
They even don't even want the difference between the good life and the bad life.

258
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,079
That's that's part of it.

259
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:29,280
There are no moral guidelines, no more rules, no sort of Kantian belief in economy or but it there is there are good guys and they have good lives.

260
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,839
It is paradoxical, but it's terrific, it's brilliant.

261
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,719
I think it's right.

262
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,319
I'll defend this.

263
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,159
Uh, you next to me, yeah.

264
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:47,760
I'm just trying to recall from the conclusion one discussion about the whole refining button the morals was arguing.

265
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,159
Would higher be considered as false morals?

266
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,959
Would be yes, and then again actually would be no.

267
00:24:53,119 --> 00:25:01,199
In this part of these are very universal characteristics that guideline in all cultures.

268
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:13,120
And in profound ways to identify the good guys would plus principles or rules or human nature or anything to find a culture.

269
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,960
In that way, the weakened age be valuable or age be dunk.

270
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,760
Old people could be valuable or cultures can be bad, anything like that.

271
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:44,919
And in that way, the cultural relatives, that there are these structures of God, that any human being has a world and everything there is something like, you know, I forget a good blog and bad guys, the authentic ones and the inauthentic ones are going to be the same from the blackboard to those things.

272
00:25:45,000 --> 00:26:11,959
There's no ground for anything we can find, and yet, by formal indication and working it on with who was basically, can help us distinguish between, yes, channel authenticity is perhaps what makes this book so high disadvantage of the gale-Christian position in our sense of the same thing about ethics and morality and so he's managed to save his money non-realistic, non-leveling.

273
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:25,079
He's trying to save a kind of way of having my moral judgment in a time in which we are in a certain way across relativistic realists.

274
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,760
And that's what makes it so important.

275
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,159
Okay.

276
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,559
At the close of vision one, he said something like that.

277
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,480
Heidegger wasn't saying that there is no supreme good or being, he's just leaving that open.

278
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,879
But is that deeply inclusive?

279
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:44,839
Did I say that?

280
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,319
Yes.

281
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:45,639
Really?

282
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:46,599
On the podcast.

283
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,559
I always do a describe this thing?

284
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,800
I think you were referring to it.

285
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:57,960
Say that again.

286
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:04,079
He said, I believe, if I'm right back, that Heidegger leaves open the question.

287
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,200
He's not saying distinctively that there is no God or Supreme Being or Absolute.

288
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,240
He's leaving that open for each individual to search themselves.

289
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:31,599
But isn't it deeply implicit throughout being a time that you can't have something like that because when you enter into anxiety, what's revealed to you is not a divine order or it's nothingness.

290
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,559
Yes, that's inherent to the situation of anxiety.

291
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,439
That's a good point.

292
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,480
I see what you mean.

293
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:48,719
Let's think about a supreme being who reveals to you the moral order and sometimes you actually die.

294
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:58,720
I don't know why he's believing him, Heidegger's, at least brains that I don't know what he wants to say, but he wants, he takes the stand to talk none of his business.

295
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:10,879
If that age is dead CL and not ASDCL, and nothing he can do to prove that there's no Supreme Being in no life after death, or that there is life after death.

296
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:19,280
And he isn't kind, he's no secular or naturalist kind of fundamentalist, and he's no Christian fundamentalist either.

297
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,559
That's all just Axis dead CL for him.

298
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,200
So that means that he needs it open.

299
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,719
Now your question is interesting.

300
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,079
And what about anxiety?

301
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:35,119
Doesn't anxiety reveal that you can't have that kind of grounding in the purity?

302
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,200
I think he does want to bring both these things.

303
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:52,439
I think he definitely wants to be somebody who says it's none of my interest in business or a view of religion and belief in the afterlife theory.

304
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,600
I'm going to tell you the structure of being on dead and so forth.

305
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,999
But he tells you anxiety is a ruin of any type.

306
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,959
That is, it was a fine boy, it's the best revealing, who is revealing experience, and anxiety was the experience of the groundless mind.

307
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,719
Well, let's see what other people are thinking about.

308
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,559
I think you're getting yourself into this lemon.

309
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:21,800
I mean, if we think about his word, all these structures, he's neutral with respect to authenticity and, you know, we can try and generate an ontological essay.

310
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:25,400
There would be one imperative to be what you are, to be authentic.

311
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:26,520
But he keeps saying over and over.

312
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,800
I agree with everything you say, but he's putting the argument one step further.

313
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,999
What about anxiety?

314
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:33,800
I would say the same.

315
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,800
It's like the temptation is to read all these categories, authenticity and authenticity.

316
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,720
One is sort of good, one is bad.

317
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,880
There's an implicit imperative towards loss.

318
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:45,239
But with all these structures, I think he's really useful perspective.

319
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:50,359
He's just going to tell you more primordial structures for surface structures.

320
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,480
And he keeps saying over and over, and there's no imperative to...

321
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,199
Well, I'm not convinced by that at all.

322
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,359
What about the being in the booth and the uncle?

323
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:07,319
I think even unless you do an esoteric reading in which you sort of practice his own language and sort of try and get behind in language, he keeps over and over.

324
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:12,119
He's not making any wrong claims about whether you have to live in the primordial structure to dress the...

325
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,239
I just don't recognize that Richard.

326
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,959
When you think about it, I think he's telling you exactly what it is to be authentic and authentic, isn's saved enough to go groundless.

327
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:22,359
I agree.

328
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,000
He's telling you what it is to be each.

329
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,040
I don't think he's generating any sense of the sort of moral imperatives that you and Eugene want to know.

330
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:30,800
He isn't.

331
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,719
I'm clear about that.

332
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,360
Telling you any specific thing you could lose in terms of your anxiety and design.

333
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:44,639
But there is a way to do it in which the authentic person does it, and you can tell the difference.

334
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:45,520
That's the crucial thing.

335
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,959
You can tell the difference, but I don't think he's saying you have to try to be authentic or inauthentic.

336
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,280
It's probably the wrong notice.

337
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,879
You're called the art.

338
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,760
But conscience is.

339
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,879
There's just possibilities that guidelines can get themselves into.

340
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,639
You either aren't.

341
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,399
I don't think there's any imperative that can be done.

342
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,360
There's no imperative at school's life.

343
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:13,199
But there's certainly no way to prove whether you're going to be authentic or inauthentic.

344
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,919
It's not up to your sort of willpower.

345
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:21,920
But there is something like an imperative.

346
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,880
Your conscience is not calling you and saying, well, you can be authentic or inauthentic.

347
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,959
But you, you know, your conscience is saying you've got to be authentic.

348
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,160
And the only way to avoid it is to cover up your conscience with the story we're about to hear.

349
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,399
If your conscience is giving you nice for your guidelines, it isn't.

350
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:52,159
And when you're authentic, this is why you're not recognizing the idea that any authentic or anything follows the idea about what you could do in these particular case.

351
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,439
But you're reading, so the only imperative I think you get in Heidinger is become yourself having learned it.

352
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:01,439
There's text.

353
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,240
Having learned it.

354
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,159
So he's going to tell you who you are in the guidelines, and the imperative is become it.

355
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:14,959
And the way you and Eugene are using it is telling you the reference design, authentic, inauthentic, and implicitly it's become the authentic person.

356
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,520
The other way of reading is just the same, these are the structures.

357
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,640
Um you're in one or the other.

358
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,599
And I still don't understand what to do with anxiety as a primordial uh disposedness.

359
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:29,639
He's supposed to show you something, what to show you something.

360
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:31,480
I think it's a possibility of being.

361
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,439
It's like these are all.

362
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,040
That's more than that.

363
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,480
It's more hungs be scientific.

364
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:47,239
But I don't think he's going to I don't think unless you read against his own language, not to be able to generate a comparative for his against the one.

365
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:55,879
Well, what you think that what do you think conscience is calling you to is not an imperative to be authentic and face up your anxiety instead of playing games.

366
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,199
This is what it's doing.

367
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,479
It's not clear, though, that anything's wrong in this.

368
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,160
I don't think he agrees with Pastella.

369
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,240
You shouldn't go out and cover up your wretchedness by playing billiards with hunting and dancing.

370
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,559
Eugenia has been involved in the selection cost of any of that.

371
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,680
You started with the same thing.

372
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:21,079
But he's saying that the policies have hung and haunting the problems when we're calling that hungry function.

373
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,319
That's interesting, but I do think he goes further.

374
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:25,240
I think I'm following him.

375
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:32,200
When he tells you that anxiety really experiences it, I think it's much worse than Eugenia.

376
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:37,480
Not only does he stop short of saying these things, he often says the exact opposite.

377
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:41,399
So it's the sort of reading you guys are offering.

378
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,119
Well, with authenticity and inauthenticity, he says it over and over.

379
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,240
Do not read this as an imperative, moral imperative to be authentic as a...

380
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:49,079
Don't read it as an ethics, doesn't it?

381
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,080
I don't think he ever says to be not an imperative.

382
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,479
There's not supposed to be any norms of weight on these structures, any of them.

383
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,280
And no normative weight on telling you that anxiety reveals things in a time.

384
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,839
I don't know if a privilege was.

385
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,800
Well, I don't get it.

386
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,999
I think you may be writing the books you should have written.

387
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,119
I'm not sure.

388
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:20,479
But the way him first talk that he brought it up, and then you wouldn't seem like you have to describe a moral evaluation to that.

389
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:33,999
But if you're in the groundlessness of anxiety, it seems like only from that point and in the groundlessness can is authentic and possibly possible.

390
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:50,720
Because if in this revealed experience, if what is seen is an absolute cross-cultural, a historic value that you must ascribe to, then how then authenticity is sort of laid out for you right there.

391
00:34:50,720 --> 00:35:02,240
And then authenticity would kind of be following a roadmap, and it wouldn't be the owning of the self and sort of the individuals.

392
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,599
David, what this is a fascinating discussion, I just want to take on you can crack on it.

393
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:20,000
What you're really trying to interest me to watch when he's what I'm about to see, when he talks about guilt and conscience, and who is this call?

394
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:24,479
And what is Dazon free because we're in hell?

395
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:28,879
And what would he be doing the right thing about anything?

396
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,720
Does that have any concept?

397
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,159
These are the very questions that you're asking.

398
00:35:34,160 --> 00:37:21,279
How normally a view and how to say death too, but death is something that's true that that's a great individual class do and do when it is in the building, we aren't able to see if we're looking for just what kind of any we think performance you want to say so he's just regarding your normality of the lack of imperative be authentic um i think that makes sense i think it would be difficult for heidegger to justify an imperative to be authentic like you might say that your conscience is there and it compels you to be authentic in one way or another but that's not an ethical imperative as well imperative any kind of that makes you do so even if there's no political imperative whatever that is where um even if it's not present explicitly in the evening program i think in certain respect that sort of imperative is present implicitly like for example when we see kindergarten influence on heidegger when he speaks of leveling and just looking at his language i mean i can't read the german but looking at the language in translation it seems as though heidegger had a certain present i guess towards level and seems to have perceived it himself on a non-philosophical unlike both as a negative thing and he seems to have his own ideas about it so um the impression i got anyway was that although heidegger wasn't willing to take the step and make an ethical imperative and say you should be authentic he did not seem happy about people being inauthentic in something else you know maybe i could take over what he said and put it this way that he thinks that there is a more or less primordial understanding than about non-loading levels and it covers up the true the more primordial understanding of what it is to be done.

399
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,119
That's already in the important term of opinion.

400
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:35,519
Then the discussion is evident because as neatly as what you could be doing, or any way imagining what you shouldn't be doing, follows from this idea that there is a work.

401
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,719
I guess I'm just pamping out on the hand now.

402
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,159
One thing at least follows.

403
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:53,120
Don't will, don't gossip, don't have a non-primordial understanding of reason because it belongs to the very healthy thing for doing what you get it right.

404
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,600
That is, don't cover it up.

405
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,359
And then we're still not getting any, you don't know how much normativity you get at.

406
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,079
There is none we are called to get that, that's the truth.

407
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,720
And we don't know yet what follows.

408
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,119
So again, we've got a few started this and a very interesting.

409
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:14,879
I'm going to throw one more thing out there.

410
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:19,520
Isn't normativity itself always in second sense?

411
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:37,679
Because if there was normal to autonomy and two cultures and to establish or having a set of beliefs, and I mean, isn't Dallas and I at Roth Bottom just playing normalist?

412
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:42,399
You didn't take all the kinds of, you know, what do you mean by norm?

413
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:47,200
There's no not going to be called cultural values or rules or virtues.

414
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,519
Those things could be called to make what it is that he does.

415
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,160
That is to take a stance on its own deity.

416
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,079
It looks like it's built in.

417
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,280
One does a long way to take a stand on it.

418
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:07,439
Maybe because other you're the kind of being that has to originally divergence and sweet and overall.

419
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:10,639
Or it's not that you're the kind of being that good?

420
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:22,280
It doesn't have any moral normative guideline, except that it better manifest its all these and required to sort of get right about the proof of Dai Line is.

421
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,760
And there is one all across all cultures.

422
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:38,040
It's a funny I'm just trying to give you this funny feeling that there's something normative going on, but it's nothing like rules, virtues, principles, practical justifications, and all that.

423
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:41,719
Something else that the name for it is ontological.

424
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah.

425
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:55,560
Well, um, being similar norms, of course, you can develop a darkest part of that, but it's not really just like what needs that because Gosman is an existential part of Daisy, also.

426
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,079
We are historically thrilling.

427
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:05,159
So in that situation, we are a situation where there are big norms and things we're calling to, and we can respond in some way or another.

428
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:23,479
So it's it's a particular there's a strange kind of normativity that we deal with, but it's not, but there's nothing but that's that sort of norm is not a constant norm or something that it does not even sort of erased here in our mind either that you should you're throwing in the culture where where they are.

429
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,599
So it seems well because this is if you're doing this long in a very interesting way.

430
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:36,919
I mean, you might say you're you're throwing into a culture and you don't do what the culture does tell you is the right thing to do and they're not right.

431
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:44,999
No, no, I mean it's not like a vertical it's it's also uh I mean it's just I guess I'm I'm thinking more of just the neoliberal that that people are kind of concerned about.

432
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:56,679
It's is is that Heidegger doesn't isn't a deal with nothing because you are you are born into a culture that you that you can take an authentic stance towards or a an inauthentic stance towards.

433
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:57,959
Yeah, I mean it's not it.

434
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:06,640
It's not in a risk of healing and virtue ethics or anything where you're still looking for whatever things are your culture or something.

435
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,599
But you're also not, we're not just completely free split.

436
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:11,839
I mean, it's a school year time crown, isn't that?

437
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:36,319
Well, I mean, well, I think, because I think the resolution and answer is compatible with doing all that in the background because that's what you're called is telling you these are good lights, do whatever you're you can be good in the way your culture makes it possible for human beings to be good.

438
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,880
I think that's what the guilt chapter was.

439
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:44,400
And then the guest chapter just blows that up the way anxiety goes in.

440
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:50,240
And so, no, that's why it did all the money.

441
00:41:50,240 --> 00:42:11,519
The guilt chapter clearly tells you that the greatest thing you can do if you understand the call of conscience is respond in a unique way to each of these persuasions by being an expert in the values and ways of acting your guilt and conscience chapter.

442
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:26,479
He has the funny parent of never obeying the general rules that one does, but doing its own unique thing that can even look crazy for a while to the one.

443
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:33,920
But when you eventually come around to see that he is a terrific doo-who to the cultural things.

444
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,159
So but the phonemist uh we want Aristotle.

445
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:54,919
Aristotle said outside with any kind of norms of of uh thought that you could find in comics or in value ethics even, because uh that is he's outside it in the sense that they don't tell him what to do in a situation.

446
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:02,760
He just spontaneously, automatically does the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

447
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,800
That's fascinating.

448
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,119
He becomes a master of this culture.

449
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:13,400
But what the deaf ones is, in effect, okay, Aristotle, that's all correct about that.

450
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:29,080
But the interesting thing is Aristotle and the pharmaceutical, they equip the whole background of values and virtues and understanding of what a human being is and could be, and within that, the the pharmaceut is a master of it.

451
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:45,640
And thus, the thing that the part on death says, all grounded and if you think that there's a cultural sort of support for what you're doing, then you're a master of your culture, that's fine.

452
00:43:45,640 --> 00:44:02,040
But you really aren't yet a full god of full design, this and the face of death, understanding even the very principles of their own culture is something Aristotle and the farmers don't.

453
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:49,920
I think that's what Heidi goes beyond whatever you think is doing and goes beyond what I think he's doing, or should be doing, and he's doing something more radically near the genius, Aristotelian, all the resolutions right, that's your point, do what you're called to be a master, because obviously the other time is no doubt, keep your eye open to the fruitful taste, which is what the run does, and responding to the initial having no way to justify He just says the inauthentic person responds to the general situation and the authentic person responds in a great way, without reflection, without justice, the uniquely appropriate age.

454
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:53,039
Yeah, can we spend some thoughts on those?

455
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:19,760
If it were to say that our sort of hard pairs come from our human one by culture, there's a very difficult person to explain by playing the like, you know, we got caught up, I think, about the screen old and I know and everything for sense, but you know, don't get that into the right thing.

456
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,680
I mean, that was what he had about constant sense.

457
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,280
You know, there's still a higher version of the one.

458
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,319
Yes, because if they could just say why they think it's the right thing to do, they're not the pharmacists.

459
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,599
That's the man of practical wisdom doesn't have a least handle.

460
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:44,800
He just is so good at understanding the deep meaning of his culture that he will deal with appropriately.

461
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,160
That's pretty radical.

462
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:46,879
I like that.

463
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,599
And a culture doesn't make any sense.

464
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,640
I mean, people who have, I don't know what you read, maybe Georgia is the closer.

465
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:02,640
The person who, I'll just tell you the volume on this part, the person who's understood this text, I don't think the Burst of English people understand it very well.

466
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:14,640
Whenever I read them, they seem to think that Aristotle is a pharm is built by what they're doing and and understands the the je something like the general situation.

467
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:27,159
Anyway, uh what Gourdru talk when he talks about the cultural virtuoso, the logic of facts, uh Bourdreur has an understanding a very very like all of them.

468
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:40,599
What he calls cultural virtuoso could do that if he does it by deeply accepting the whole culture.

469
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:50,599
I mean, Bourdruit generalizes and only this being when you get to have open source programmes, not what he's about.

470
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:59,319
You can have it say only the experience of the logic of death make you sort of even free of your whole cultural background.

471
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:00,039
It looks like it.

472
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,319
I hope that's wrong.

473
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,240
Yeah, that's Stephen.

474
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,119
But just a small point about self-formal indications with the badge.

475
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,359
We have to be careful though when you're talking about things like guilt of conscience.

476
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,760
Remember that they were formally indicated as being guilt of conscience.

477
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,280
You don't get to sort of remind the the normative or moral baggage attached to the phenomenon.

478
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:27,640
I feel that in the discussion of formative conversation with us.

479
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:34,520
Yes, and no, I mean, the you do leave the moral baggage of the door, so to speak, little by little.

480
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:38,200
I mean, I don't think we're disagreeing, but that's how formal indication works.

481
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:49,879
You have to start thinking that gold is that yellow stuff or the like or that lightening of those bright splashes and maybe quickly kind of examples that are easier that he is what he is warm.

482
00:47:49,879 --> 00:47:51,959
You've got to start with things like that.

483
00:47:52,280 --> 00:48:00,919
And but and in this case, you've got to start with a moral view about guilt, if there are things that are wrong and we've done them and done the wrong things are guilty and so forth.

484
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,080
But you're going to leave all that behind.

485
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,319
And that's sure.

486
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:11,200
But whether you've left anything that has any kind of normative significance behind, keep your eyes open.

487
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:24,240
I think no, well I'm not asking what I've just asked because I think that if you get the promises and fans that with somebody who's very right to get conscience and guilt, it's about that much knowing that it is significant.

488
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,760
No more and no less.

489
00:48:26,479 --> 00:48:33,280
You can do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way, but you can't say why it's appropriate because there's no answer to that.

490
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,560
It's just what somebody really understands the culture does.

491
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,400
And not everybody, but just this person in this situation does.

492
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:46,800
So there's some normativity in there, but it's just so sort of cleaned up.

493
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,719
That's what we're going to talk about next.

494
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:50,479
But I thought I could talk about it.

495
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,720
Yeah.

496
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,640
Yeah.

497
00:48:56,959 --> 00:49:11,760
So the cultural virtuoso being the virtual cable sort of men's day thinking that I could talk about where you kind of reflected very deep fundamental way about being itself.

498
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,999
How we discover something.

499
00:49:13,999 --> 00:49:16,559
Because the collective decision doesn't need anything.

500
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,079
No, he certainly doesn't need to do that.

501
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,319
He means that a culture virtual ethical person certainly is the most likely place to find one.

502
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,999
I think it hasn't been the black wars.

503
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:29,039
You ever write never went to school and certainly arts corrupted by philosophy.

504
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:31,519
That you don't need to you don't need to have that.

505
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:49,399
What you need is having driversion, what you need to become a cultural virtuoso is a dumb sense of anxiety and not just believe the norms that Rosanches tells you to cover up and here's the rules and rationality required and all that stuff.

506
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:57,800
I've got enough anxiety to fail to not accept, not believe that, not experience that.

507
00:49:57,879 --> 00:50:00,680
The present thing happens too.

508
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:07,479
And then you've got to have this type of he doesn't talk about much, but you never have to.

509
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:17,560
Because there are lots of experience in the culture of not doing what the norm to be the general situation requires.

510
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:23,160
And sometimes it works very well, and everybody's happier afterwards disaster, and everybody hates you afterwards.

511
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,160
And if you have enough experiences like that, it takes them seriously.

512
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,399
You get more and more skilled at being, say, in a given way, Greek.

513
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:41,319
And the more skills you get, and the more of a mastery you get on the basis of a lot of trial and error that you take to heart, then you get to get from the column.

514
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:41,959
How do you do it?

515
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:46,039
Wouldn't that require comes from reflections?

516
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,759
Ah, ah, that's such a good question.

517
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,280
I argue what's going on.

518
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,000
It it can involve reflection, but it doesn't require.

519
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:56,199
This is how it looks.

520
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:02,359
I I wasn't going to I'm I'm here in a paper when I was going to tell you reading grants too.

521
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:06,999
But there's like this story about how you go from a novice for a master, so that's what I really thought.

522
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,200
He had to get the way I see it anyway.

523
00:51:12,999 --> 00:51:13,879
What do you think you think?

524
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:28,759
Wouldn't it require oh yeah, reflect not on necessarily no rational getting down into these lines of issues about just proof that you ate the big scale, I didn't think about it.

525
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:36,240
But the question is, if you learn by making a mistake, feeling bad about it, two ways you can go for it.

526
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:43,359
You can make yourself do some kind of disputes.

527
00:51:43,439 --> 00:51:49,200
You can look and you can try to figure out just what went wrong and make up your mind not to do it again.

528
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,680
The analogy of that is something like the golfer, the famous thing.

529
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:09,200
Yeah, Tiger Wood did when he took apart his whatever and went back and trained because he thought that he was doing certain things wrong, then he got worse, but after a while he got better than he ever was.

530
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,240
That's something like the form of meditated thinking.

531
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,319
You try to figure out what you did wrong, you feel bad about it, and you try to get clear about it, and you try to fix it.

532
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,960
But you can also just worry about it.

533
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:31,120
And the next time that you can decondition yourself to doing in the next situation what you did in the previous situation.

534
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,440
Or you can really just feel good about it.

535
00:52:33,439 --> 00:52:34,559
Now, I have to bring me in.

536
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,399
I'm the only case I know of this, and my brother is skeptical.

537
00:52:38,479 --> 00:52:42,000
But I think that's how I could be a good future.

538
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,559
That's why you have to have the faith for the line.

539
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:50,160
Because I always listen to the previous one, and what I am thinking is, wow, that really worked.

540
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,000
That was the right way to do it.

541
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:53,119
I understood it better.

542
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,720
They all understood it better.

543
00:52:54,959 --> 00:53:03,039
Or I think, oh my God, he wasted 15 minutes going down the wrong track, and now they're more confused than I was when they started.

544
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,640
I'm confused too.

545
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,599
And then we can just, and I'm just conditioning myself to do that good thing again.

546
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,600
And I'm healing because it makes me feel good.

547
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,079
Do that.

548
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,959
Don't ever do that bad thing or then because they're going to go regret it was better.

549
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:24,599
And I don't think I ever analyze, or not very often, what did I do wrong to get me on that long track or to get me on that wrong track, and so forth.

550
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:32,039
So then I think that's a non-meditative, non-reflective way of getting to the autonomous.

551
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:41,959
It doesn't matter to Heidi how you get there, to want to get to a point in which you don't anymore or even understand why you do these things.

552
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:43,960
Oh, you just do it.

553
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:46,999
And that's the intuitive mastery of user.

554
00:53:46,999 --> 00:54:05,079
And you can notice how cross-cultural that is, whether that's banmaster or verber, where that would be by who you study, the verber and the blow-through, or the astronomist being virtually like these people could be studied better than they are.

555
00:54:05,399 --> 00:54:06,200
Anyway, yeah.

556
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:11,400
Relating to the idea that the authentic person can act without justification.

557
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:16,920
Is it that the authentic person acts entirely without justification?

558
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:22,760
Or that they sat down and thought that they could justify it, but they but they just don't.

559
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,760
I mean, I guess I understand that.

560
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:29,959
Going back to the idea that it doesn't make any sense that the moral person could act without a specific thing.

561
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:37,479
I think it's understandable, but it's very terrifying, I guess, that an authentic person simply does something totally unjustified.

562
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,119
That's right.

563
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,319
They can't explain it to you.

564
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:39,639
That's right.

565
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,919
But it's just somehow very appropriate.

566
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:41,559
That's right.

567
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:54,599
And it is sort of terrifying, but that's how the is the the virtuoso can't tell that you or themselves why that was the appropriate thing to do.

568
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,079
If that specific thing was the appropriate thing to do.

569
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:03,999
In fact specific situation, they can't even generalize it or this thing that climbed in things you have to do.

570
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,720
So they're going to learn things and experience successes and failures in their behavior.

571
00:55:08,879 --> 00:55:15,519
On the next crime area, what is sort of the same situation, it won't look like the same situation.

572
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:17,440
They won't do the same thing.

573
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,240
When you get really good, you can make a neural model of this.

574
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,240
There isn't any rules and representations.

575
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,919
It's got to do with neural networks and chaotic attractors.

576
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,599
They may not help some people.

577
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,720
It may help others.

578
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:42,879
You can make models of the brain which imply that there isn't any where people you can't give your reason.

579
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:47,599
You can't justify what you do if you're an expert in do it.

580
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,039
And that might be terrifying.

581
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,039
Yes, but is it appropriate?

582
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,160
Anyway, aren't there reasons to wish it's appropriate?

583
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,079
Theoretically, if there are reasons, can't you decide that there are not reasons why it's appropriate.

584
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:05,520
It's appropriate because that's what Fran might do and other ones will recognize it.

585
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,440
There are certainly some gross guidelines of why what's inappropriate.

586
00:56:11,439 --> 00:56:17,920
And there are certainly for not appropriate meetings just people who are competent in proficient.

587
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:30,239
There are guidelines that you can give and reasons why you should why it's appropriate, for instance, that give people their condolences, give the relatives condolences when somebody dies, so forth.

588
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:41,359
But when it really gets to the crankshaft situation and and in a specific case of what you do and how you do it, you're not going to have any reasons at all.

589
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,240
Yes.

590
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:51,479
Really help out in thinking that understanding is not right, there's a know-how, not an explicit.

591
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,280
That's right, it's not.

592
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,839
They're kind of know-how.

593
00:56:53,800 --> 00:57:08,839
Right, so if you express a reason, an assertion of why you did something, you can't possibly express all the nuance of the situation and the know-how so that an inauthentic person might understand.

594
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:12,359
Like sometimes it might be possible, but it's not necessarily.

595
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:15,639
You're more likely to be able to get another pharmaceutical understanding.

596
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,639
But even then, you may not.

597
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:26,120
I mean, all the other pharmacists in my picture take test masters will understand in the sense that you'll see that that was the appropriate thing to do.

598
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,279
And he'll say, well, yeah, that worked.

599
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:34,119
But that doesn't mean that now they've agreed on what the rule was or the analysis for.

600
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:39,800
All they agree is that if you play a million moves, just to have to play the visa and that's what it goes.

601
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,760
If you made a million chess moves, that'll look you like a very good move to make.

602
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:50,439
If anybody else is making chess moves, it'll look like it'll probably look good too like a good move to make, but they can't tell you why.

603
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:51,879
But yeah.

604
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:57,240
So practical morality becomes a very that's a funny way to put it.

605
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:04,519
That suggests that you use your towards which you want to get it or something.

606
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:05,240
Okay, you're right.

607
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,200
You're right.

608
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:18,120
Insofar as it's just like just like networking talk about human beings like stuff, you have to follow the rules and get that back and a computer has to.

609
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:29,800
I mean, and there's and there's no actual governing um you know, there's no mental political governing uh guidelines and inclusion for actions.

610
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:39,280
Um and that just as one can calculate um reasons for uh uh opening sprints and getting productive data.

611
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:49,599
You're making some point about about um where you're probably lost having red.

612
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,559
But they go ahead with this.

613
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:06,319
All you really need is to be able to get exactly and and there's no respect or possibly the mask attack weren't there.

614
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,159
So it's pretty much the same with the quality of the and moral.

615
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:17,119
People people were asked to you can they would postulate reasons for having done it, but they weren't actually part of this.

616
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,959
There were no decisions, there were no rules again, that's all to the truth.

617
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:30,879
And the reason you know they weren't part of surprising that there was no phenomenon large in memory, that's phenomenal memory of it, is that if you follow those rules, you won't get that expertise.

618
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:42,879
You may get that result in that situation, but the expertise were recognized as similar situations and very similar things, and there are no rules or even the really important rules.

619
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:51,999
Therefore, an effort to learn or a computer or a robot could never be something that even grasps an art.

620
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,919
Well that is that's what's so funny.

621
00:59:53,919 --> 01:00:08,479
And I would say that the only people who lastly are rules or they can have expectations that many situations at all.

622
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,439
If so computers could do that, maybe you could do that.

623
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:16,879
Yeah, I don't think that's what morality is exactly, but they could never act they wouldn't be more experts.

624
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,800
Anyways, you you don't have to worry about that.

625
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,200
Uh uh so what are we doing?

626
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,119
Yeah, I'm I hear you part before.

627
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,760
I can either go back to problem or or I have all you said we want to study.

628
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,599
You've got a lot of clearing up the things that we're going to come up next time.

629
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:47,800
If there's no harm in that, I will now know that I can the last car, I I would love to start on the bills.

630
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,399
You can see how it works.

631
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:56,039
You're picking out signs.

632
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,040
You'd like to know the essence.

633
01:00:58,359 --> 01:01:02,760
You all know right stuff like that, where you follow deal fast with good things.

634
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:03,959
Oh, okay.

635
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:10,520
And it has a much more of a connotation of owing something.

636
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:14,600
So when you want a debt, you are showing somebody a certain amount of money.

637
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,359
It's so magnetized.

638
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,720
It's it's not it's not the determinant you'll do is radically disinheriting it.

639
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,160
It's just it'll start this inner component in it.

640
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,280
It's a lot less.

641
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:42,039
If it starts with his words, so he does with the person who is who is somehow responsible for something and owns the deals and social work.

642
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:51,480
And I do as you do that why I know there are no very german to to be guilty of being responsible for a license.

643
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,160
That is you owe somebody's money, or you bought somebody's money.

644
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:07,040
You're somebody who's in those guilt is you're guilty when you're a ponderous sort of land and your conscience tells you your responsibility for it.

645
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,080
And you ought to understand.

646
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:17,039
Now, the next thing to talk about, some way, is a long way.

647
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:22,240
Commentary marvelously, don't misunderstand it.

648
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:28,640
Because what I say in the commentary is, well, it's not that you've done something wrong.

649
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,319
This is my question.

650
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,879
I understood that it wasn't in a way that I was.

651
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:37,839
Now, I want to say, well, what is guilt?

652
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:42,959
It's not having done something wrong, because that seems to be just the ordinary.

653
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:45,760
As you later said, don't do it.

654
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:53,679
That's what the one person who's done something wrong and you had this person.

655
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,599
He just played responsibly and picked up.

656
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,720
And I wanted to say, well, what does Heigris do?

657
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,319
It really does problem.

658
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:03,280
That's not guilt.

659
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,519
If that's the one, what is guilt?

660
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:10,879
And my answer I had tonight: guilt, yes, handsome history.

661
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:13,919
You know, we just know very well.

662
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,439
So let me go on without that.

663
01:03:15,439 --> 01:03:18,400
The guilt is ideal lacking in some way.

664
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:26,800
If that's what one normally says and think, that in fact, guilt is some kind of, is the reverse of it.

665
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:33,120
That idea is a cover of something else which is ontologically guilty.

666
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:40,160
And the interesting thing about ontology, no, is that ontological guilt isn't a bad thing of things.

667
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,400
It isn't going to be black.

668
01:03:42,399 --> 01:03:44,720
It isn't something you could face.

669
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,640
It's not something you can wrong.

670
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:48,999
It's not even.

671
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:50,439
And now here's my mistake.

672
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:52,599
I said, no, it's not something you did wrong.

673
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:58,839
Well, I said, well, you can't ever be clear about what you're doing.

674
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:02,040
You can't be losing the autonomous.

675
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:06,760
You can't take full responsibility for the lack of truth.

676
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:20,120
And that's something you're going to read a lot in what we're talking about when Heidegger says what ontological guilt is you don't get behind your throne about honesty and what you're doing and stupid about things.

677
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:26,519
It proves that Heidegger says what the state was to think that that's something wrong with you.

678
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,839
Heidi's things, that's fine.

679
01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:31,000
That's just, in fact, that's good.

680
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:35,959
And guilt hasn't gotten anything to do with what's wrong with you.

681
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:49,160
The normal, the founding guilty, being loses and really do what he'll conscience for.

682
01:04:49,479 --> 01:04:55,720
But the good thing, and the interesting thing is, that's just an ontological fact about people.

683
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,999
Everybody, all Daseins are all guilty, all equally guilty at all the time.

684
01:05:01,479 --> 01:05:02,519
That's what's talking.

685
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,839
If you read this, read him in a point away.

686
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:09,959
He's guilty of a bad thing, and you get over it or have less of it, or some people have less of it.

687
01:05:12,439 --> 01:05:13,959
There are two important points.

688
01:05:13,959 --> 01:05:16,359
One is I just said, I'll say it again.

689
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:40,559
He thinks that everybody's, every Dasein is equally guilty, and pretty anything else is guilty because whatever the essence of guilty of when you've done the hormones, maybe just you found out what guilt is, but the structural feature of God's eyes, and every die's eye has itself, but though you're on the wrong track, I mean, guilt, that's what I was doing when the company students are thinking.

690
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,520
You can't be wrong with Dazine, and it has a certain structure.

691
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:53,200
They never get clear, ever get clear of what the world is doing.

692
01:05:53,519 --> 01:06:06,960
You can never understand what you're doing, just like you can get clear about what it is that we need to do, that you can tell being in and you will do things for people.

693
01:06:06,959 --> 01:06:08,959
Then you will have absolute guilt.

694
01:06:09,439 --> 01:06:17,199
Basic structure, that there's lots of what you be able to be explicit about or basically.

695
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,039
That's the structural feature.

696
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:28,319
The second point is it's not only a fact that you all get one thing that there's something worthy, you know, basically.

697
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,879
Whatever we do, that's what Bruce is talking about.

698
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,599
I know identity because we don't choose it or give them a narrative.

699
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,040
That's why I'm going to be the reader, but I brought along.

700
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:46,800
He didn't have any non-lucidity.

701
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:51,280
You do function, playing the positive thinking.

702
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:55,599
We're in the world of art and in order to work with art.

703
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,519
The main sort of is backwards, and you never is reverse.

704
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:11,599
Every decision bases itself on something not nasty, something concealed and confused, something would never be a decision.

705
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,400
Now, why?

706
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,159
Because that's not certainly you don't understand it when I just read it.

707
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:17,600
What does it mean?

708
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,839
Clearer what it means, and the guy's discovered.

709
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:25,400
But when it amounts to it, you have to look at the other side of it.

710
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:35,560
Wasn't it so that you could justify what he does, you could recently clearly understand what he's done and justify the office the right thing.

711
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:38,839
What does that look like?

712
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:57,399
Well, Jeffy God said, when you break down together, that if you aren't competing on principles, then and you wanted to always do the right thing, you have to understand by some kind of principle why what you're doing was the right thing.

713
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:10,680
But then you have to understand that you would be in a kind of redress in which you would be in sort of principles maybe for justifying your first order principles and principles for your studying to justify.

714
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:17,800
But you are in a redress in which you never get to the self-justifying principles that you've got.

715
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,079
At least you believe in revelation.

716
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:26,680
So there has to be something which is not a problem.

717
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:37,879
But there's not explicit foreground, loosened reasons or principles.

718
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:42,119
Because, I mean, there's a better way to put it.

719
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:51,159
I mean, it's harder, but suppose you were able to loosenly and freely what you were doing.

720
01:08:51,159 --> 01:08:55,720
Now, we've got this one problem: how you would ever justify your principles.

721
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:01,039
The more interesting one, maybe, how your choice would never make any difference.

722
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:02,199
It'd be a choice.

723
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,400
You probably know some of you.

724
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:11,839
This empirically has these free movements prominently one eating not to gamble anymore.

725
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:17,439
And the voice may have to be choices because no replay.

726
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:28,159
If decision-making is completely free, then it's everything to constantly up to new decisions and up to grab.

727
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:42,640
So somehow decisions have to be based on something which can't be justified principles that are justifying what we because there's always got to really make sense.

728
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:50,159
There has to be a background on which, insofar as you have any principles, gives you a sense of the justifying.

729
01:09:50,159 --> 01:10:03,520
Whether that's revelation or what it has to be done with very high freedom in which when you do something, it doesn't just count as a very clear rooster decision we make for us.

730
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,760
So it's on the basis of how we should want to exploit it.

731
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,520
Now he's trying to find his ignorance.

732
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:24,239
That's all in this one hurting, which says, in a sense, if being guilty, it's a structure that works rules that positive people of God.

733
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:37,919
But if you can't get someone in its planet, to be that sentence has always been so interesting, every decision bases itself, that's the on the basis of it.

734
01:10:37,919 --> 01:10:47,159
Basically, bases itself on well, let me decision based itself on something not that used to deploy.

735
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:50,279
Otherwise, it won't it won't get a grip on the way.

736
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:55,319
It's a bunch of redress, I think it will go into a seller.

737
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,400
So, what does this mean?

738
01:10:58,119 --> 01:10:59,560
Somehow we all hold that.

739
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:06,039
Well, basically, and now we turn it thank goodness we do money between people.

740
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,480
I don't have it there either.

741
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,239
Well, I did not have it.

742
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,119
No more.

743
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:17,399
You feel some that's mainly.

744
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,919
That sounds rather good.

745
01:11:19,239 --> 01:11:20,119
Do I hunt?

746
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,039
Yes, exactly.

747
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:22,999
Thank you.

748
01:11:22,999 --> 01:11:26,839
Okay, so all of this we are involved in on the story.

749
01:11:26,839 --> 01:11:30,520
And this is how we're going to find out where I'm going to be able to structure it.

750
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:38,119
One ontological view is when we've got it into new things with the ability to rule.

751
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:44,600
We find out where it is next to its eyes that it's a positive thing, and that's what we do here.

752
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:46,359
The threshold is being planned.

753
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,439
It's all about it on the basis of it.

754
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:53,640
Very about 320 or 300 times.

755
01:11:53,959 --> 01:11:56,119
Uh, very near.

756
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:57,959
It is built, delivered over.

757
01:11:57,959 --> 01:12:00,279
This is what it is to be built as structural.

758
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:04,199
As such, it's been just always an entity that does deliver.

759
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:09,159
It is existing with the basis of its ability to do.

760
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:24,680
Although it has a lot of it reposes in the way that it works down and going and how is the online entity into which it's been grown, the stuff which is the way the basis was done can never underline the exact basis is equal to it.

761
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:28,839
And yet, as existing, it must take over being the basis.

762
01:12:28,839 --> 01:12:35,839
It be its own basis, with the ability to be a total of the visual voice, don't just be rewarded as a punchline.

763
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:41,279
It's being evasive, it's just growing about unconsciously lagged without responsibilities.

764
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,839
It never exists before this as this basically done now.

765
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:56,959
Thus, being evasive, one's almost being from the ground up, just not belongs to them doing anything as being self-being evasive is analyzing itself.

766
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:00,319
That is actually a constant.

767
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:11,279
You can never have become your own being who can what it is, that's what guilt really is.

768
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:17,680
Nothing to do with having done anything wrong, planting anything, bullying and things.

769
01:13:17,919 --> 01:13:21,279
And it's not because you're falling order being your concept.

770
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:23,279
There's something wrong with us about autonomous.

771
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,439
No, it's not something wrong with us.

772
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:34,959
It's just the structure of a being that is on a basket and always has to be has a big dirt that has to always act on that basket.

773
01:13:34,959 --> 01:13:37,039
And that's just like guilt.

774
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:39,119
It's not recognizable.

775
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:41,119
Nobody in their right mind is there.

776
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:45,839
No ordinary everyday person would understand what the world was talking about.

777
01:13:45,919 --> 01:13:47,680
He said, Well, guilt, everybody's got it.

778
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,359
Everybody's got the same amount of it.

779
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,720
You don't want to get rid of it.

780
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,480
It's really a positive good thing.

781
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:54,480
But that's how it turns out.

782
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,800
If you think to be the opposite one, it turns out to be the opposite of what you would have brought.

783
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,839
That is, when you would have bought you something, it was so boiled.

784
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:10,760
You could do that stuff, but what's uncological is this structural.

785
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,959
Oh, yeah, fun.

786
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:20,119
And then the final result is that things are the color up this full resistance.

787
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,959
You can't take responsibility.

788
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:26,760
You have to take responsibility for it, even though you don't know why they do years.

789
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,239
That gives you the anxiety of your what I just described.

790
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,439
There's money, then you can see the last build was going on.

791
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:40,520
And why just want to why do people think it doesn't give you that one?

792
01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:42,839
You don't need to be bought to one of it.

793
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:50,600
But all that is a color of it now, because it isn't a case of clarity rules.

794
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,879
But those things come in colour up where you live.

795
01:14:55,879 --> 01:14:57,720
But those things are the full reception.

796
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,319
It's going to be all formatted.

797
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,239
There's always something theory of experience.

798
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,999
The real decision.

799
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:10,279
Okay, I think you I said
