1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,599
So let's just go back to where we were.

2
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:12,560
Let me say that we I'm not going to go back to death, which has its own complicated stuff in it, which we did a lot with last time.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,959
We've got to go on to the part on anticipatory resoluteness.

4
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:55,759
So the first thing, general thing I want to say is that it's part of the way formal indication works, that it's never, it's not too clear when you've done it completely and gotten rid of all the everyday and traditional ways of thinking about guilt and death in this case, but other problems, other things in other cases, but like, but let's not talk about the others.

5
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,319
Anyway, you never are sure when you've got it thought sort of formally indicated, cleared through.

6
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:05,760
And I think that's the problem with death.

7
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,920
Guilt, I think he does it.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,879
So I want to go back and start by just saying some general things about that.

9
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:36,799
But because if you see what happens with guilt and conscience, how totally they are formally indicated away until their essence has sort of, as I say, either nothing or 180-degree opposition to their way we normally understand them.

10
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:39,759
Well, look what happens with guilt.

11
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,439
I mean, it turns out it's being the basis of a null projection.

12
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,080
It's being ungrounded.

13
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,759
It's not being able to get behind your thrownness.

14
00:01:52,759 --> 00:02:00,439
It's sort of the opposite of responsibility, of autonomy, of choice.

15
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,880
Well, no, never mind choice.

16
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,159
Choice is still in there.

17
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:12,680
But the very fundamental notions about conscious conscience and guilt all turn out to be part of the cover-up.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:24,199
So the final story, the ontological story, when we finally get to the essence of guilt, it doesn't look anything like what we thought guilt was.

19
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,519
Let's look at 328.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,399
There's where he says he's going to formalize it.

21
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:52,680
When he's talking about this thing, which I'm calling formal indication, what he always means, this business, we talked about it, you designate something, and then you formalize it is you go and you investigate it more, and you see that the traits that it starts, the theme that seems to have when you started, are cover-ups of something more basic.

22
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,720
And this is what he's doing on 328.

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,040
I'm just going to go back there for a minute.

24
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:08,599
On 328, in the bottom paragraph, he's telling us how all, and I didn't read this, but it's exactly what I said last time and what I just said now.

25
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:18,520
The way you drop out all the characteristics that described what you're dealing with when you finally formalize it.

26
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,879
So let's look at the bottom of 328.

27
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,160
Gipping in a little.

28
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:33,360
The idea of guilty must be sufficiently formalized so that those ordinary phenomena of guilt which are related to our concern for being with others will drop out.

29
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:36,240
So all the ordinary phenomena of guilt are dropping out.

30
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:45,920
Owing anybody anything, feeling guilty toward anybody, lacking something that you should have done for somebody, all that's gone.

31
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:55,120
The idea of guilt must not only be raised above the domain of that concern which we reckon things up, but also detached from relationship to any law or ought.

32
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:03,439
So conscience has nothing to do with what you ought to be doing, and guilt has nothing to do with failing to do what you ought to be doing.

33
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,279
They're just not normative notions when he gets done with them.

34
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,719
So it's not a question of ought that failing to comply with it loads you with guilt.

35
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,599
For here, too, guilt is still necessarily defined as a lack, when something which ought to be and can be missing.

36
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,920
And that's just not what it is.

37
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,599
And then he describes what it is at the middle of, a little above the middle of 329.

38
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:39,280
We define the formally existential idea of guilt as being the basis for a being which has been defined by a not, that is to say, being the basis of a nullity.

39
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:47,039
And then he describes more later what kind of nullity it is, this kind of nullity that can't get behind its ruin it.

40
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,079
Now that this kind of review, I only say it because I don't think death is pushed all the way.

41
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:19,480
I think that some of the characteristics of death are the essential ones, and some of them seem to be characteristics of the terminal event that is at the end of your life, not perishing, not the end of your life as a living thing, but the end of Dasein, as we said in the very end of the last lecture in a hurry.

42
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:34,599
And what it looks like, sometimes there's an unget-aroundable end in which sooner or later you find that you have no more possibilities.

43
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:50,840
And that, I think, is and that seems to contradict some other aspect of death, as he defines it, in which you put the emphasis on possibility, that it's, I would, it's the possibility of having no more possibilities.

44
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,560
It's not the, in any way, the actuality.

45
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,800
So it's the possibility of world collapse, to put it in another way.

46
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,959
It's not the event of world collapse.

47
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:14,839
It's not something that happens inevitably at the end of Dasein's existence when it ceases to be.

48
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,000
All of that seems to me is not formalized enough.

49
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:45,080
What's formalized enough is that there is some unrelatable and in some way certain characteristic of Dasein's way of being, and that gets covered up with this, all anything that has to do with what could happen to you when the world actually collapses and what is inevitable and what is terminal.

50
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:51,400
That's covering up some constant way the Dasein is.

51
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:57,240
And that constant way the Dasein is is vulnerable to world collapse.

52
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:20,720
And that's what's being covered up by the story, by whatever is left in his definition of death, which points to there being at the end of Dasein's life this inevitable event after which it has no more possibilities, the absolute impossibility of any possibilities.

53
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,680
That's the wrong end, the wrong way to think about death, I think.

54
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:40,320
So anyway, that's, I just can't come back to it because I sort of brood about it, that I can't, anyway, get all the characteristics of death together because some of them seem to be more formalized than others.

55
00:07:40,319 --> 00:08:04,719
And I think, and I'll just say it again, it's just a kind of intuition that just as guilt is utterly separate from, that ontological guilt is utterly separate from something you can incur or take on yourself or hold off or that has anything to do with others, has anything to do with normativity, guilt is just something else.

56
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,200
It's thrownness, and that's just different.

57
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,360
And I don't, and I think death should be something else just as different.

58
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,240
And that something else just as different is that Dasein isn't a necessary kind of being.

59
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,000
It's always possible that Dasein will stop being.

60
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,760
That's just another way to put it.

61
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,480
It's that.

62
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:43,279
And when it does, it's not, uh it needn't be a kind of stopping of being, which is the final one, a terminal one, an inevitable one, and a certain one.

63
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:52,040
All that sounds too much like croaking, or if not croaking, then some other thing that happens to to Dasein at the end of its life.

64
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,480
So, okay, now I'm just repeating myself, so let me go on.

65
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,240
So, I'm going to catch up where I was going.

66
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:20,760
Death is not perishing, it's a way of life, and it seems sometimes to be a terminal Dasein kind of demise event, and the end of all possibilities, and sometimes it seems to be further formalized and be the possibility of the end of all possibilities.

67
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,080
And that's how I want to understand it.

68
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,560
So, let me see where we I'm still trying to review and thumb up here.

69
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,560
So, we get to the question, and how does one act when one makes death a way of life?

70
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:56,840
And to do that, we have to take a big detour now through guilt and resoluteness, and how that combines with anticipation to get you anticipatory resoluteness, and what kind of life you lead when you are anticipatory resolute.

71
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:37,040
And now, I think how much I haven't figured, I'm so confused that I haven't even been able to figure out the following, how much of this my confusion is in the text, and how much of this confusion, if it is there, is caused by the fact that he begins with anticipatory, as you know, and defines it and starts the whole division two with a big discussion of death, and then he does through then he does guilt and resoluteness and conscience, and then he comes back to death by throwing by bringing in anticipatory, which he's already done.

72
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,640
So but let's do it now in his order and see if we can make sense of it, the way he's doing it.

73
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,960
So we're going to start on 306.

74
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,360
I'll begin with 306 because that's where he brings in anticipation too soon.

75
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,600
He's talking about death.

76
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,000
He hasn't he hasn't said anything about anticipation.

77
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,639
And all of a sudden, on 306, he introduces it.

78
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
I believe this is the first introduction of it.

79
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,960
And I think he's introducing it here as a technical term in italics, the second paragraph.

80
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:23,360
The being towards this possibility is being towards death is so to comport ourselves towards death that in this being and for it, death reveals itself as a possibility.

81
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,240
Our term and possibility doesn't mean some present-at-hand possibility.

82
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,080
There's some possible event that's going to happen in the future sometime.

83
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,680
Inevitably, he clearly doesn't want it to mean that.

84
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,960
It's a possibility, the way possibility operates with Dasein, namely, it's a way that your whole life gets structured.

85
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,480
It's the sort of shape of your projects.

86
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:04,160
The stuff that I think Bill Blattner is very good on, where what is it to have as your for the sake of which is something that organizes all your activities.

87
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:23,560
So here, anticipation as a possibility for Dasein organizes something, gives some kind of way of acting to Dasein, which he isn't ready to talk about yet until way later, but he introduces it here.

88
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,840
And okay, so he wants to introduce anticipation of a possibility.

89
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,079
But in this way of behaving, does there not lurk a coming close to the possibility?

90
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,480
And when one is close to a possibility, does not one its actualization emerge?

91
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,680
Of course, that would be not the way it works with Dasein.

92
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,440
Present-at-hand possibilities, I think you realize, but I'll just repeat it.

93
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,000
Present-at-hand possibilities remain possibilities until they get actualized.

94
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,959
And then generally, they're better than possibilities.

95
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,440
Kant's famous for saying that real dollars are better than possible dollars.

96
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:11,160
But the existential possibilities are higher than present-at-hand possibilities.

97
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,279
They don't ever get actualized.

98
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,560
It isn't as if they're possible for a while and then one day they become actual.

99
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:24,760
They just stay possible as what organizes your life.

100
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,680
Maybe, I mean, this is such an interesting idea, and I believe what Blattner says about it.

101
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:49,240
I mean, so if your ultimate possibility as Dasein is to be a professor, say, that doesn't mean that one day you'll get actualized as a professor, and then you'll be even better than being a possible professor.

102
00:13:49,240 --> 00:14:01,680
That means that being a professor organizes everything you do in such a way that it couldn't be something you would arrive at and actualize, like getting tenure.

103
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:13,200
It's constantly if it weren't for already using the word actual, you could say it was constantly actual, but that's wrong, because that's present at hand thought.

104
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,760
It just constantly organizes whatever you're doing, if it's your for the sake of which.

105
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:25,280
And death is doing that too as a possibility.

106
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,800
It's constantly organizing what you're doing.

107
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,040
I'll read it in the very italics and then you can talk, Delaney.

108
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:40,960
The closest closeness with which one may have in being towards death as a possibility is as far as possible from anything actual.

109
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:52,480
And the more unveilingly this possibility gets understood, the more purely does the understanding penetrate into it as the possibility of the impossibility of any existence at all.

110
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:00,960
And that possibility is not some event that could ever occur.

111
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:10,960
That some that is, well, again, that's all going to organize everything you do.

112
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:19,279
It is that your world, your design can stop being at any moment.

113
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,919
But that it's not the moment when it stops being that's important.

114
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,439
What's important is the experience that it's possible that it could collapse.

115
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,720
Okay, Delane.

116
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,079
Okay, good.

117
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,559
One with a kind of a cognitive or more conceptual?

118
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,599
No.

119
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:49,639
There is another distinction which you're interested in, but I think between expectation, which is the representation of something that's going to happen that hasn't happened yet.

120
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:57,320
But then there's something that's not an expectation, but an anticipation when you're coping with things and you're like Mirabel Fontee.

121
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:09,399
And it's not like that either, because both expectations and anticipations have a condition of satisfaction in which they finally happen.

122
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,599
They arrive.

123
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,559
Well, yeah.

124
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:21,399
Or at least your Mero-Fontee's anticipation of a doorknob as you get up to leave the room and your hand begins to take the shape of the doorknob.

125
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,160
That's certainly not an expectation.

126
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,439
You're not expecting the doorknob, but you're anticipating it.

127
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,759
And if something happens and suddenly it gets taken away, you'll be startled.

128
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,599
So anyway, it's neither an anticipation nor an expectation.

129
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:45,000
This kind of anticipation that he's this kind of possibility that he's talking about no fictitious conditions.

130
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,480
It never is actualized.

131
00:16:50,119 --> 00:17:18,359
Even and he's sort of constantly playing with the fact that even when your possibility of having no more possibilities is actualized, it's not really actualized because there's no you anymore and it's it's not there's no if you never take part in an event which actualizes the possibility of your having no more possibilities because the you're you're defined by your possibilities and when that event that having no more possibilities occurs, you're not there anymore.

132
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,960
And he's clear about that.

133
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,919
That's another way of saying it has no actualization conditions.

134
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
Anything else?

135
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,759
I I'm happy to hear people say things because it will help maybe understand what's going on.

136
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:34,640
But I'm still sort of trying to get a running start to what we read today.

137
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,000
I went way back to try to see if I could see how it all fitted together, and I failed.

138
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,519
But I'll go through the process that I went through.

139
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,960
Okay, let's see.

140
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,919
Where are we?

141
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,519
So there he defines anticipation first, I think, on 306.

142
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,119
And he talks more about it on 308.

143
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,439
And where I don't know, let's see.

144
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,440
Oh, here at the bottom.

145
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,120
He's going to come back at the bottom in that bottom paragraph.

146
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:24,159
When by anticipation one becomes free for one's own death, one is liberated from one's lostness and the possibilities which themselves upon one and liberated in such a way that one can authentically understand and choose among the possibilities lying ahead of the possibility.

147
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:37,759
Anticipation discloses to existence that its uttermost possibility lies in giving itself up and shatters all tenaciousness to whatever existence one has reached.

148
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:47,519
Now, I read that because that's the way anticipation comes back when he gets to anticipatory resoluteness.

149
00:18:47,519 --> 00:19:01,759
Then he says that what happens with just plain resoluteness hasn't sort of given up all clinging tenaciously to possibilities.

150
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,440
And that's what happens when you go from resoluteness to anticipatory resoluteness.

151
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,439
So he's got it, he's putting it in here, but he's going to need it way back later.

152
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,080
And that's all I can say about it.

153
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,279
He doesn't need it here.

154
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:22,920
And he does, but he's, well, no, but he tells a whole story here, which he's going to come back to later.

155
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,279
Let's read a little more.

156
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:43,400
But what he says here, briefly, he's going to say later when he does anticipatory resoluteness more thoroughly, namely that you can't, how does he put it back there?

157
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,559
Well, we'll wait till we get there.

158
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,679
But what he says here is, anyway, and what the general idea is, that you've got to be flexible.

159
00:19:50,680 --> 00:20:05,000
And when you're throwing into a way of acting which is resolute, you must always be ready to give up whatever particular projects you're acting on.

160
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:18,200
And that's part of resoluteness is that you're acting in a way that is ungrounded and not guaranteed, and it can collapse.

161
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,599
So here's the first sort of thing that anticipation has to do with world collapse.

162
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,800
Let me just read a little more.

163
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:30,759
In anticipation, Dasein guards itself against falling back behind itself.

164
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:40,440
It guards itself against becoming too old for victories, free for its own most possibilities, which are determined by the end and so are understood as finite.

165
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:58,439
Dasein dispels the danger that it may, by its own finite understanding, fail to recognize that it is getting outstripped by the existence possibilities, by the existence possibilities of others, or rather that it may explain these possibilities wrongly and so forth and so forth.

166
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:11,039
That is, I take it, that you've got to be ready always to take back whatever it is that you have committed yourself to and defined yourself in terms of.

167
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:26,319
And that anticipation is the stance which is always open to taking anything that it's committed itself to back.

168
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:45,919
But not just, this is the kind of thing that Hoagland is good on, not just sort of flighty flexibility, ready to take anything back, not sort of postmodern flexibility for its own sake, but simply that you never get fanatical, you never get stuck on anything, even though you stick with it.

169
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,400
This is Hoagland slogan, stick with it, but don't ever get stuck with it.

170
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,039
That's what anticipation is supposed to give you, that he's talking about here.

171
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,000
And he talks about it, and he talks about it in italics on the top of 311.

172
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:16,159
I'm reading all this, although it was part of last time's reading about death, because the anticipation part of it is what comes up again after he does the part on guilt.

173
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,159
So we've got to go back and find it.

174
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:26,399
So he says now at the top of 311, we now summarized our characterization of authentic being towards death as we projected it existentially.

175
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:42,240
Anticipation reveals the asynchronous lostness in the day self and brings it face to face with the possibility of being itself, unsupported by concerned felicitude, by being itself in an impassioned freedom towards death, freedom towards death.

176
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:56,839
I'm always wondering whether death is the freedom towards the world collapse, or whether the freedom towards death.

177
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:03,720
Well, I don't, a freedom which has been released from the illusions of the day, practically certain of itself, and anxious.

178
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,720
We said last time that death was, what was our slogan?

179
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:17,240
Death was the acting on the possibility of no more Dasein, right?

180
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:18,840
What was the phrase?

181
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,639
I have it here from what you wrote down last time.

182
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,839
Death was the possibility of demise.

183
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,720
Freedom toward the possibility of demise.

184
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,359
See, that's the weird.

185
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:52,519
I would have thought freedom to act in terms of the possibility of demise, which was really freedom to act in the light of the possible impossibility.

186
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,279
And freedom towards death is death.

187
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,519
Death is the I'm lost every time I get into this.

188
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,119
You say something, Eugene, because I'm reading.

189
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,960
Free being towards death.

190
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,720
Free being towards death.

191
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,079
Where towards death?

192
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,039
Okay, free being towards death.

193
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,240
Let me think about it.

194
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:26,519
Yeah, but then but that's but if you say that death is the possibility of demise, so freedom, okay, to be to act in the light of the possibility of demise.

195
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,440
Is that right?

196
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,000
Really acting in the light of the possibility of demise.

197
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,159
Then you don't look happy with that.

198
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,360
I don't know.

199
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,640
Okay, yeah, yeah, Tyler.

200
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,919
What's better with the word death?

201
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,799
If every time that we're death, we get part of it.

202
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:57,359
Well, y well y yes, everything's lost because if all you've got left is stuff that happens to people at the end of their lives, and then the whole thing is supposed to be something you do ra you're doing right now.

203
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,960
Okay, I see you're going to keep dying as a way of life.

204
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,279
And have death, not d not death.

205
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,119
Well, let's try it and see what happens.

206
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,079
Impassioned freedom towards death.

207
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,119
But he's got death.

208
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,559
Now what are you supposed to do with it?

209
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,240
Freedom, okay.

210
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,599
Impassioned freedom towards the end.

211
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,279
Is that is that demise the end?

212
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:26,559
Because because I think that we want we want whatever this impassioned freedom towards death, that ought to be what you're calling dying.

213
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,039
Yeah.

214
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,720
We don't want to talk about death.

215
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,839
It's part of option.

216
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,480
Okay, now being towards the end with dying.

217
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,279
Okay, wait, well, before you talk about the Eugene, you want to answer.

218
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,640
Yeah, I want that.

219
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:41,039
But it's characterizing the possibility of the essence of it.

220
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,839
But why does it help to put in place of death perishing, which is an event?

221
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,519
Of no more possibility.

222
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,000
Okay.

223
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,680
But and dying is fine.

224
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,600
Dying is uh living.

225
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,720
Dying is a way of life.

226
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:08,480
Dying is living in the light of or in of the fact that Dasein is uh has this possibility of having no more possibilities and that's supposed to permeate everything you do.

227
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:19,640
And one of the ways it permeates everything you do, just so we put it with is the way it keeps you from getting stuck on anything as if that was something that you y that was absolutely important to you.

228
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:39,960
You will be able to give up anything that seems absolutely important to you since you've sort of given up everything, given up the assurance of everything all the time when you were as you act, once you've understood that you're always acting in the light of the possibility that I take it it wouldn't be uh what it w Tyler, would you object?

229
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,519
I don't know.

230
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:45,879
I've always tempted to say you you act in such a way that the next moment may be your last.

231
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,279
I take it you really aren't supposed to say that, but it looks like that's what it comes to.

232
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,960
That you stick with that.

233
00:26:51,960 --> 00:27:04,120
Okay, and it sounds better too than the thinking that the next moment may be your last because that makes it it's it brings it nearer, but it's still something that hasn't happened yet that might happen, and that's not what you want to deal with.

234
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:17,480
You want to deal with something the other thing, the possibility of no more possibilities, not the next moment maybe the moment in which the possibility of having no more possibilities gets cashed out or something like that.

235
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,839
That's not it.

236
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,799
I okay, go ahead.

237
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,720
Well, I think it's an additional guilt and viability and economy.

238
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,000
So I think perhaps we should struggle with the definition of death with death in a lot of things.

239
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:41,080
And regarding the phrase freedom towards death, I I don't know Sorry the mention both of them buying thought that is well that's what we're trying that's what everybody seems to be saying.

240
00:27:41,079 --> 00:28:02,320
Yeah, freedom towards death is o according to Tyler and uh and I think true misleading way of taking taking it because you can you can't help but get fall back into getting death that seeming to be like demise and seeming to be in the the ev the event of the ending of Dasein, which isn't quite an event, but that is important here.

241
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:20,319
So we better just leave it and just say, instead of freedom towards death, dying as acting in the acting with and committing yourself seriously, but always flexibly to whatever it is you're doing.

242
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,119
That's well, that's what it is to have an impassioned freedom towards death.

243
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:25,759
I take it.

244
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:33,519
And of course you'll you'll be out of the either one because it gets committed to doing all sorts of things or is flighty and never commits itself to anything.

245
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:49,040
This is a way of being not flighty but steadfast and yet have in a certain way already got over sort of any kind of fanatical attachment that if something or other doesn't happen it'll just be total disaster.

246
00:28:51,839 --> 00:29:11,039
I'm teaching Kierkegaard now and in Kierkegaard this is the the the movement of resignation that everybody's got to make, that everything is a gift and you don't have any claim on anything and you can't be sh you can't you can't uh make your happiness depend on having achieving something or other.

247
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,799
And and then you'll be able to really devote yourself to things and enjoy them and so forth.

248
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:23,680
But you give you give up some some idea that you it's it's it's related to autonomy again, isn't it?

249
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:34,720
Some idea that you can control your life and that you can commit yourself to something and re remain committed to it no matter what.

250
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:45,720
You've got to realize that finally you're you can't uh control your life and that you well what?

251
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:53,480
But you that you are ready to give up any particular possibilities that you're projecting into.

252
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,080
Somebody else had a hand up?

253
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,119
Yeah?

254
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah?

255
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:06,759
Well, yeah, but it's comporting toward life under a certain description, namely as always possible break.

256
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:22,119
I mean, I don't know if I have to put possible in there, as never guaranteed of, never necessary for, never necessary in the sense that you can count on it, never necessary in the sense that you have to get you couldn't get along without it and so forth.

257
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,159
So it's a certain way of dealing with all possibilities.

258
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,519
But that's a way of life.

259
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,200
Yeah, that's we keep coming back to that.

260
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,880
You look close, you're worried about that.

261
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,480
Yeah, that it does sometimes.

262
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,839
Give us some German.

263
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,159
Good.

264
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,599
Impending me, you never want to get close to repeat this.

265
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:47,400
Think that there is, that you're moving nearer and nearer to some moment, which is this moment of death.

266
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,519
You are moving nearer and nearer to some moment, namely perishing.

267
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,040
But that isn't important for one thing because you won't be there.

268
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:54,599
Go ahead.

269
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:03,559
Yes, it's important always to say that, and that would be for Delaney, so don't let the word anticipation fool you.

270
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:09,319
It's just for life, and which means just, as Eugene says, running ahead.

271
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:18,600
And again, even that's sort of confusing because it sounds like there's something in the future, that you're running ahead to, but it isn't even that.

272
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,839
Going forward.

273
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:28,519
Yeah, going forward, I guess you can say that, without, yeah, as long as you are going ahead, that's all right.

274
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:33,359
The point is, don't think that you're getting nearer and nearer to something when you're running forward.

275
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,199
That's then, as soon as you do that, then you get back.

276
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,519
You have to keep telling yourself this.

277
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:47,519
Death is not something impending in the sense of a future possibility which will someday get actualized.

278
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,960
There is such a thing.

279
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,720
Namely, you're perishing.

280
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
But it's not what we're talking about.

281
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,359
Any more force?

282
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,599
Calls us forth.

283
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,879
Okay.

284
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,120
Good, good.

285
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,759
And all of them are avoiding, and that's just the other way of saying what he said.

286
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:13,519
All talk of somehow anticipating, getting nearer to it, and so forth.

287
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,280
It's not an event in time that we're talking about.

288
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,319
Okay, conscience comes along later and calls us to do it.

289
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,119
That's good.

290
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes, that's a way a way.

291
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:30,000
You're trying to explain, and I hope somebody would, why the chapters are in this order they are, is that right?

292
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,400
Yes, I think conscience could be put afterward.

293
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,679
I don't really understand.

294
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,119
I don't see how guilt, how not get behind your throne is.

295
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,000
There are two parts to what comes afterward.

296
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,360
The guilt part I would have put in front, by your conscience part I would have put after.

297
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,840
Yeah.

298
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Okay, yeah, go ahead.

299
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,400
Right.

300
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,160
Mortality.

301
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,439
I think Heidegger would like that.

302
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,239
Yeah, I like that.

303
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:58,799
That's good.

304
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,519
And then, you know, what's really good is later, Heidegger, he refers to us as the mortals, whatever he refers to people.

305
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,880
And he says always something like, the mortals are the ones who can die.

306
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,279
And I think any normal person reading it thinks, aha, he means that, you know, they're going to croak sometime.

307
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,159
But he doesn't, of course.

308
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:24,600
He means the mortals are the kind of people who can, are the kind of beings who can live in the possibility of no more possibilities.

309
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:25,960
Period.

310
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,399
Yeah, mortal is good.

311
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,039
He just he really despises that.

312
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,680
Okay.

313
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,719
Yeah.

314
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,920
If it's foreboding, that's unfortunate because that's the just impending.

315
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,880
We don't want that.

316
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,000
We don't want that.

317
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,960
Because are you suggesting that we should li look at it?

318
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:43,239
I see.

319
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:43,879
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,239
Well, no, I think that's right.

321
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:51,159
We avoid anything like that that what did you say again?

322
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,319
For foreboding.

323
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,599
Foreboding is what?

324
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,079
That you think the sad event is going to occur and you have a bad feeling about things.

325
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,760
At least, and that association we don't want.

326
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,039
That's like, yeah, that's like feeling of the safe is going to drop on your head soon.

327
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,399
And that's foreboding.

328
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,400
That's not, that's not it.

329
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,600
Okay.

330
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,799
Ready, everybody?

331
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,599
Well, that was helpful.

332
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,519
So now we can go on.

333
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,880
So we're going to live in the face of the constant possibility of world collapse.

334
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,680
And that gets us to anxiety.

335
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,519
All these things are in here.

336
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:34,359
I was one of the things I was trying to s see was if there's you should keep your eyes open for it too.

337
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,440
I found half of what I was looking for.

338
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,280
I think there are three, I said this before, three forms of nullity.

339
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,240
There's the nullity of being the null basis, which is the guilt one.

340
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:53,880
There is the nullity of the possibility of no more possibilities.

341
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,120
And there's the nullity of choice.

342
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,119
And he does name them all nullities.

343
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,440
I wondered if he did.

344
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,879
But what I'm surprised at is I can only find two anxieties.

345
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:09,039
There's certainly the anxiety that death is anxiety at the bottom of 310.

346
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:21,600
And that's because Dasein is face to face with the nothing, where I'm about 15 lines from the bottom of 310, of the possible impossibility of its existence.

347
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,720
So anxiety is the experience of being face to face with the possible impossibility of your existence.

348
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,279
And that doesn't mean that you're just about to be hung or something.

349
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:40,559
That means that all the time, you're always anxious and you're always in the face of the possible impossibility of your continued existence.

350
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,160
And so there's an anxiety of death.

351
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,280
And later he's going to tell you there's an anxiety of guilt.

352
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,320
And I'm sure there's supposed to be a third anxiety of choice.

353
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,080
It's just that he's so uninterested in it that he didn't bother to name it.

354
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,559
And it's just important to keep, it's helpful to keep those three in mind.

355
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:23,519
They're all aspects of the fundamental, as he says here, the fundamental nothingness, really, that Dasein is, if you're looking for something of the strong sort that philosophers will hope to have, some kind of grounding, there isn't any, that's the guilt, and some kind of assurance that you're immortal.

356
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,440
There isn't any, and that's the anxiety of death.

357
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:39,759
And the anxiety of choices, the funny one Sartre likes best and Heidegger finds sort of boring is that if you choose something, you don't, you can't choose a whole lot of other things.

358
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,440
You annihilate them.

359
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,960
So every choice nullifies a whole bunch of other possibilities.

360
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,719
Okay, now where am I?

361
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,199
Back to this.

362
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,200
So anxiety comes in here.

363
00:36:50,519 --> 00:37:01,000
And now we want to talk about how th this is going to be attested, which is his word, when I say manifest in how people live.

364
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:09,000
What is it like to to you are existential the existential.

365
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:19,160
You are this kind of nullity which is thrown and towards death.

366
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,279
And how do you live that?

367
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,039
How do you attest to the fact that you are?

368
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,359
Well, this is at the bottom of 311.

369
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:32,119
If we succeed in uncovering the attestation phenomenologically, that well see, let me stop, go back a little.

370
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:41,800
The question of Dasein's authentic being a whole, remember he started with that, and of its existential constitution still hangs in mid-air.

371
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:54,200
It can be put on a phenomenal basis, which will stand the test only if it can cling to, if it can cling to a possible authenticity of its being, which is attested by Dasein itself.

372
00:37:54,199 --> 00:38:02,039
That is, is there a way that Dasein can manifest that it has or is this structure?

373
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:18,600
If we succeed in uncovering that attestation phenomenologically, together with what it attests, then the problem will arise anew as to whether the anticipation of death, which we have hitherto projected only in its ontological possibility, has an essential connection with authentic ability to be, which has been attested.

374
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,919
In other words, can you live it?

375
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,440
What is it to live your mortality?

376
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,240
And that's that's the end of the chapter.

377
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:39,360
So now, that gets him to where I'm convinced he should have been already a long time back, namely to talking about guilt and resoluteness.

378
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,320
And that's uh on the next page.

379
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,240
So now we're on 312.

380
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:53,360
And conscience calls us to our being guilty and then we act on it.

381
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,320
When we act on it, we act resolutely.

382
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:04,480
So on 314, conscience summons Dasein to being guilty.

383
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,879
And then we hear lots about how it doesn't speak and how you have to listen to it.

384
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:17,200
And what we understand is that conscience calls you to be authentic, not to do any specific thing.

385
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:23,519
And wanting to have a conscience is a good thing because it's wanting to be authentic.

386
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:32,880
And you are always but having a conscience isn't what isn't being guilty.

387
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:42,240
Conscience calls you to face up to and manifest the fact that you are constantly, always, structurally guilty.

388
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:52,159
And that means always throwing in a way that you can't get clear of and you can't get clear about.

389
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,840
We talked about that already, so I'm going to just keep going.

390
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:04,720
So so we've got conscience, I don't think I need conscience calls you strictly to nothing, he says on 318.

391
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,720
It calls Dasein forth, it forces Dasein to out of the they, and so forth.

392
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,519
I just we don't need any of that for what I'm trying to get.

393
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,480
So let's go to 321.

394
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,480
So there we get to the anxiety that goes with thrownness.

395
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,440
And that's in italics two-thirds of the way down.

396
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,320
Again, it's about a kind of nothingness, a kind of uncanniness.

397
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:44,839
Remember that uncanniness is unheimlich in German, which means I would choose to translate it weird.

398
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,720
Now I think the right way to translate it is unsettled.

399
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:56,200
And I'm trying to just Heidegger's trying to say that it's ungrounded is the thing he's really thinking about.

400
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,960
It's unrooted.

401
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,480
There's no basis that it can count on when it acts.

402
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:10,680
So uncanniness reveals itself authentically in the Finlish Kite of anxiety.

403
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:14,600
It brings Dasein face to face with the nothing of the world.

404
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:20,200
And Dasein finds its uncanniness and so forth.

405
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:30,359
And that is Dasein's, what, at the bottom of the page, primordial, thrown, being in the world, as not at home, that's the unheimlich.

406
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:37,559
The bare that it is, the nothing of the world, and all that, which we already in Division I.

407
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:46,760
I'm going to get to the part where he puts them together, but I'm since I can't understand the part where he puts them together, I'm trying to lead up to it in such a way that we that somebody can understand it.

408
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,360
So now I think there are two so there are two nothings.

409
00:41:50,360 --> 00:42:00,000
We we've done the nothing of Dasein, that's the nullity of death, and now we've got, in effect, the nothing of the world, as he says back here.

410
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:12,320
That is, there's a kind of way in which the world is, you're never at home in it.

411
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,279
And period.

412
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,160
And I don't really have a feeling for that kind of uncanniness, I must admit.

413
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:22,400
I think some other people do.

414
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:34,720
I think I can't tell whether I've ever expected the world to be more grounded than it really is, and therefore I don't feel unsettled, or I think it is more grounded than it really is.

415
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:41,920
If anybody has a feeling for unsettledness and this kind of anxiety, say something about it.

416
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,719
You can see it in movies and books.

417
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:46,080
That's the best I can do.

418
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:58,319
The famous movies of unsettledness are all the Antonioni movies with Monica Viti wandering around in a world in which she just can't relate to anything, not the people or the things.

419
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,000
Nothing matters and nothing grabs her.

420
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,719
And have any of you read The Movie Goer for Walker Percy?

421
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:07,679
That's a great book.

422
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:09,519
That's totally about anxiety.

423
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,119
Written by Walker Percy, after he read Heidegger, Kierkegaard.

424
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,360
He was an MD, and then he got tuberculosis and spent a lot of time in the hospital and read existentialist stuff.

425
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,839
And then he wrote The Movie Goer.

426
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,920
And that's, it's just like Antonione movies.

427
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:36,080
This woman who's the moviegoer likes to hang around in deserted movie houses in the suburbs because nothing's happening and nothing matters.

428
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,480
And it's the exact opposite of the Italian stock market.

429
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:51,720
I switched Antonionio movies where Monica Viti comes in at one point and sees her lover in the Italian stock market where everybody is so utterly frantic as if their life depended on selling these stocks right now.

430
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:55,400
And she looks at them as if they're some other, some alien form of life.

431
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,079
But I don't directly understand the uncanniness of the world.

432
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:02,839
Does anybody want to help me out?

433
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,320
Yeah.

434
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:04,679
Wait, let's close it.

435
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:05,480
Will somebody close?

436
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,199
Wait, I couldn't hear you.

437
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:07,319
Will somebody close the door?

438
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,000
There's a conversation picking up out there.

439
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,000
Now try again.

440
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,559
Yeah.

441
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,320
I don't think that's the right experience.

442
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:26,519
It's this very world right here, clear as day, you all sitting here, which is unsettled and unheimlish.

443
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:40,519
And well, well, yes, I guess covered up, but it isn't as if to uncover it would be for things to come apart in some way and get fuzzy or full of surprises.

444
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,519
That's not what's covered up.

445
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,480
What's covered?

446
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:46,119
I can't, I really wish somebody could tell me.

447
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,480
I would love examples.

448
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,880
Thank goodness for the movies anyway.

449
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:56,759
But right now, you've heard me say this, some of you probably.

450
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:03,399
Once I was teaching the anxiety part in Division I, and some student ran out of the room and blew up.

451
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,079
That's the right kind of reaction.

452
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:10,519
I wish I could understand what was going on in that student's mind.

453
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:11,080
Yeah.

454
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,679
Yeah, I've heard them.

455
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,919
Okay, well, that's closer.

456
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:29,759
Now, now, if you could understand like why we here, right here in the in the West, in our own culture, right at home in our university, are feeling the same thing somehow as somebody like Saeed would feel in a, you know, that's the problem.

457
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:38,480
I mean, I can understand how I could feel at home if you transported me to, well, I don't know, some country that I'm to Japan.

458
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,039
I've been there.

459
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,240
It's pretty strange.

460
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,240
But in an amazing way.

461
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:50,880
But the point is, we're supposed to be covering up the fact that we're not at home right now here.

462
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,360
And what that feels like, I don't know.

463
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:56,399
Did you want to say anything about Stevens?

464
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:57,279
Okay.

465
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:05,759
Now you can know, if you could only move this one step further, that we're supposed to be anxious right now, always, constantly, if we're authentic.

466
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,719
There are two kinds of anxiety, the shattering kind.

467
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,679
Well, this is back to, you've all had Division I with me, so I don't want to spend too much time on this.

468
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:31,600
But remember, that Division I is about the kind of thing Stephen's talking about, where all of a sudden the world withdraws and just shows up as meaningless, pure, present at hand, and nothing matters, and you can't understand why anybody does anything, and you're paralyzed.

469
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:40,159
That kind of anxiety is, I haven't experienced it, but I could at least if I did experience it, I'd know what I think I'd recognize it.

470
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:55,360
But what about the anxiety that the authentic person happily, constantly, steadfastly lives in and takes very seriously and only gives up when it's really totally it becomes impossible to do it.

471
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:06,159
You do realize that, I mean, sometimes if for instance, if you read Blattner on anxiety, you wouldn't ever realize that the authentic Dasein is always anxious.

472
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:06,920
Do you anybody know?

473
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:18,119
I'm always looking for this quote when I want it and I never can find it, where he lists the characteristics of authentic Dasein, and in it is that Dasein is anxious.

474
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,400
And so it can't be a breakdown of the meaning of everything.

475
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,600
It's a sense just of the ungroundedness of everything.

476
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:29,640
I guess it's a sense maybe that it could all break down.

477
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,519
I don't even know if that's part of it.

478
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,639
I doubt it.

479
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:40,039
There's something I wanted to say about just a second.

480
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:44,440
Oh, well, it's maybe it helps.

481
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,519
I mean, it's it's sort of a non-rootedness he talks about.

482
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:52,840
It's some well, oh, no, no, I think this is too.

483
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:58,680
I mean, I think I'm more like Heidegger than he is at this point.

484
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:13,320
I mean, later Heidegger's going to say that it's sort of Western European to be non-rooted, but that it's possible to be rooted, and that he wants to help propose a new rootedness.

485
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:24,200
And then all this attempt to try to explain why authentic Dasein is always anxious because we're always unrooted isn't isn't you don't have to do that anymore.

486
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:27,960
But in this, he certainly has an ex he's having an experience otherwise.

487
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:31,159
You're looking concerned about what I just said, right?

488
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:31,799
No, yeah.

489
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,400
Are you upset about that?

490
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,159
I just see that it's arbitrary and I just said, why bother?

491
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,119
Ah.

492
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:43,160
So so you think, just your story is I'm in it all the time, that's why I can't see it.

493
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,679
Yeah, yeah.

494
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,079
With what?

495
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:50,440
With not, yeah, with not, yeah, that's right.

496
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,559
Yes, good.

497
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:52,760
Let's put that in there.

498
00:48:52,760 --> 00:49:02,159
The collapsing kind of anxiety is what you get when you are inside Dasman and it looks like everything has intrinsic meaning.

499
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,680
It looks like Christmas cards just better be sent on Christmas, or who knows what bad thing will happen to you.

500
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:14,960
And then you get this sudden realization, well, this is an absolutely weird thing.

501
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,760
And when you go to other cultures, you get it more.

502
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:35,920
So that's and but if you're out of Dasman, then you're being in constant anxiety is just the sense that there isn't any way one ought to do it, that you have to do it that way.

503
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:45,120
Your intrinsic meaning story has collapsed, and the first stage of it collapsing is the Division I story about paralysis.

504
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:53,759
And then if you go back into the world the right way, authentically, then you'll still do what Dasman asks you to do most of the time.

505
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,120
You're not going to go around taking your clothes off or something.

506
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:06,320
And there are norms, and you obey the norms, but you no longer think of them as intrinsically the right way to do things.

507
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:16,480
Or what I think sometimes is that there's always this feeling, and even I can't get over it all of you, that there's the right way to sit, for instance, and that is in chairs.

508
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,559
It's healthier, it's more comfortable, it's in every way clearly superior.

509
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:29,759
And then there are these weird people who s squat on the floor at tables, otherwise seemingly sophisticated people like the Japanese.

510
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,200
And there are other people who sit on the floor altogether.

511
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:38,960
And there might have been a bunch of people, there don't seem to be any, that do everything they do standing up.

512
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:50,039
But anyway, the idea that there is something that one does which is because it's the right way to do it, that's what goes away when you have this anxiety attack.

513
00:50:43,679 --> 00:51:00,119
And that's what somebody who lives in it just thinks all the time, that this is all just arbitrary and there's no one way that's better than the other.

514
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,039
And you do what one does because you've got to do something and be intelligible, not because it's the right way.

515
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,239
I guess so.

516
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,200
As I said, I don't ever know.

517
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:16,759
Anyways, I would have to tell people the story of my life, and that would be a digression.

518
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,320
Because you know things about me that make you say, okay.

519
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,759
Yes, well, yeah, right, right.

520
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,160
That's and people stopping at stoplights in the middle of the night.

521
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:42,519
Hans, I mean, I mean, apparently in China that people think that's the funniest thing in the world, that people sit at an M in the middle of an empty street with all the coming into the center and nobody's anywhere, and they're waiting patiently for the light to change and go green.

522
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:43,319
I feel the same way.

523
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,519
I've always felt the same way.

524
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,399
I don't wait.

525
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:49,319
But I don't understand why anybody does.

526
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,440
But it's like that.

527
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,159
Johan Sluga has this funny story.

528
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:54,919
I haven't heard him mention it lately.

529
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:12,680
When he was in Berlin seeing some, it was maybe 20 years ago, I guess, seeing a hippie with thugs on their jacket and rings and everything very, very sort of anti-social at midnight waiting patiently on the street corner for the light to change.

530
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,359
So and that that's that person hasn't really got it yet.

531
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:21,719
And so do I see another hand?

532
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:22,839
If not, I'm going back.

533
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,400
Yeah, Tad.

534
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:50,159
Yeah, I think you've got an interesting point there, which is perhaps since I've become the example of this, I have this tendency to think, because I just said with the street light and so forth, that there's a right way to do it, namely when there's nobody around, you should go.

535
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:51,439
Why waste your time?

536
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,319
And so forth.

537
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,720
And I tend to think, I mean, the trees are valuable and that sending people Christmas cards who are across the street is wrong.

538
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:01,039
That's right.

539
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:02,879
I'm not anxious enough.

540
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:04,239
I see that now.

541
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:05,200
That's interesting.

542
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:14,479
Yes, if I were really anxious, I wouldn't have such a sense that if I were running the country, there wouldn't be people waiting at street lights and so forth.

543
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,359
That's wrong.

544
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,800
Good point.

545
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,319
Now, another hand I saw, and then I'm going to go back to this, or didn't I?

546
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,200
Yeah, okay.

547
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,239
It's the easy way you're describing to that.

548
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:29,039
It's long economic.

549
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,640
Depression.

550
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,759
Depression?

551
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,480
Did you say?

552
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:32,799
Yes.

553
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:42,960
Well, that's an interesting thing you should say that, because Heidegger later describes the same phenomena that he called anxiety, and he calls it depression.

554
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:55,600
And I think that's another way of saying it looks like Heidegger may be talking about a particular stage of German angst or something when he's thinking about it.

555
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:58,000
But I don't know.

556
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,919
I mean, there are two different things.

557
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:02,159
The breakdown one might be depression.

558
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,160
You don't want to confuse things.

559
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:11,880
When you're sitting there and you can't understand why anybody would do anything and you just can't get up from your chair, I've heard people who were really depressed say that.

560
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:21,879
A very important person to me and a therapist who was on PROSAC tried giving going away from taking, stop taking the PROSAC.

561
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:29,160
And she said, then she could just sit in the chair and there was no reason for her to move and she couldn't move, so she had to go back on it.

562
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:30,759
Okay, but that's different.

563
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:40,199
The question is, it doesn't seem like depression to say that you don't believe that there's a right way of doing things.

564
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,080
Neither the Dasman way or, as Tyler now says, even your own way.

565
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:48,519
There are just a whole lot of different ways of doing things.

566
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:51,800
And there's no ground for that.

567
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:57,480
The only thing that bothers me is I don't understand, back to where we started, why that's upsetting.

568
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,439
But I think it is.

569
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:07,480
I think it's upsetting to people who think that there are rules for how to do things and do things right, and those rules either are grounded in reason or revelation or nature.

570
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:15,640
And they would be very upset if it turned out that all these different ways of life were equally all right and none of them the right way.

571
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:19,399
Maybe maybe that we're not so much among them.

572
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,319
Maybe I'm more among them than I thought I was.

573
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:21,559
Yeah.

574
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:32,039
The feeling of depression from the state of one who has the issue of depression, in the sense that one's feeling depressed has that initial anxiety.

575
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:34,280
The world is an avoid of meeting.

576
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:39,879
Every all all meetings think that you just stand there and wonder, like, why are they going to do anything?

577
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:41,960
Everything's so good for them.

578
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:49,640
But after you overcome that feeling, the feeling happened, and yet you know that for a you have to deal with the world a different way.

579
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:54,279
Because you know that the a lot of the law is creatives for you or they're all around you.

580
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:57,559
They don't know they're always vulnerable vulnerable to that.

581
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:02,559
That at any moment the same event could happen, the same effect could strike you.

582
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,880
That suddenly everything becomes meaningless.

583
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,079
And I think before certain people deal with that in different ways, they have to.

584
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,119
So then for see the world and Lily, stop.

585
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,079
I mean, maybe.

586
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,920
I don't I don't disagree with anything you're saying.

587
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,119
He said I want to go back to this.

588
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:22,080
I mean we're getting too far into the phenomenology of anxiety and I just there's so much I want to cover.

589
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:22,799
What?

590
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,000
Okay.

591
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,480
Thanks.

592
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,679
Come and talk to me more about it.

593
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:28,880
I'm all for hearing the phenomena, but not right now.

594
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,960
So let me so we got two nullities, 331.

595
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,959
Why am I jumping to 331?

596
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,920
I have to go back.

597
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,480
321, 323.

598
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Well, the nullities I already mentioned, they're in 331.

599
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,559
So I just call your attention to that.

600
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:54,960
There's the nullity of projection, and that's tied up with the nullity of guilt.

601
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,039
And there's the nullity of thrown.

602
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:09,200
The next paragraph, the second paragraph on 331, the structure of thrownness, there lies essential in nullity as there is in projection.

603
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:13,279
And so care is permeated with nullity through and through.

604
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,719
And Dasein is guilty.

605
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:18,400
And now we go back to that again.

606
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:24,239
Formerly, existential definition of guilt as being the basis of a nullity is correct.

607
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:31,680
So that there you have really got guilt completely formalized.

608
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,960
And the question is whether death ever gets formalized that much.

609
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:46,599
Notice that all this talk about on 330 this this talk about nullity doesn't have death in it.

610
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:52,360
Now I'm trying to again tell you what I think is so peculiar about the way the book is organized.

611
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,440
I mean, death has got lots of talk about nullity.

612
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:07,400
Then you get to the part on guilt, and it's as if guilt is the main story about nullity on 333.

613
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:21,160
So uncanniness brings you to guilt and conscience says dozin is a null basis of a null projection and it's therefore guilty.

614
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,879
I mean here's one of these places where I'm confused.

615
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,880
You would have thought if you've got a null projection, it's about death.

616
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:34,360
I've always supposed that there was thrownness and its kind of nullity was guilt.

617
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:39,400
And there is projection and its kind of nullity is death.

618
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:54,199
But here you get lots of talk about thrownness and lots of talk about nullity and even talk about the nullity of understanding, which is where is that?

619
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,319
Just a second, on 333.

620
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,279
What am I looking at?

621
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,759
Where let's see, defines all the talk of nullity without reference to death.

622
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,440
I just said, oh, well, it's all, but where is the understanding part about nullity?

623
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,920
Am I imagining it when I was reading it?

624
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,920
There's thrownness so as to understand the throwing is the null basis.

625
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:30,000
Well, it's just that the call that the call of being guilty and conscience doesn't call you to face up to your possibility of no more possibilities at all.

626
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:33,199
Here, it's all done in terms of guilt.

627
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:37,599
And yet, he's already done death, so why doesn't he bring it in?

628
00:59:37,599 --> 01:00:00,960
Well, he does finally on 334, when it turns out that the call at the top is readiness for the for uh uh to the almost possibility of existence and the almost possibility of existence it would have you would have fought with death, but it's all done here in terms of uh guilt.

629
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,719
And I just think this is a sign that the thing is confused.

630
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:22,319
I mean, why didn't he could introduce the guilt part here and then the death part later, but having done a whole big thing about death and and and the uh possibility of no more possibilities and that the own death is your almost possibility, doesn't he say that?

631
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:22,960
He does.

632
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,559
And now here we are at the top of 334, and it turns out guilt seems to be the almost possibility.

633
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,000
Am I misreading?

634
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,720
I think he's just confused.

635
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:41,039
You think yes, but that was I thought the completely yours was supposed to be what death gave you in its individuating character.

636
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:43,359
And that that was the sort of feature of death.

637
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:52,559
But now we're not he's doing it as as to uh guilt and the call of conscience as getting you to the almost possibility.

638
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:58,640
Do you think that's supposed to be the same almost possibility that is the one he talks about in the death chapter?

639
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,960
It should be.

640
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:02,879
Okay.

641
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,519
They both individuate you.

642
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:07,440
Uh I see.

643
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,720
So death and guilt, each in their own way, individuate you.

644
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:15,480
And they're both ownmost.

645
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,159
I I guess.

646
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:26,600
When he introduces the almost in the death thing, he seems to make it sound as if it's a very special characteristic of the way death individuates.

647
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,559
But you think that?

648
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,199
Maybe not.

649
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:36,840
Anyway, it better not be, because it looks like there are two different ownmosts and two different individuations, and now he's doing the guilt one.

650
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,880
And there's certainly no talk about death in here.

651
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:46,839
So, okay, well, I think we have to agree with we have to do with what Eugene said.

652
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,239
We have to think that there's just two different stories about what's ownmost.

653
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:53,319
And your throneness is owned most.

654
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,159
And so I think that's hard to get because you see what I mean?

655
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:02,039
Because there's something about the way death isolates you, and nobody can die your death.

656
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:05,719
It doesn't look like guilt isolates you and nobody can have your thrownness.

657
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:07,239
That's a non-relational.

658
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:15,240
That's right, but but guilt guilt doesn't have you mean almost doesn't have to be non-relational.

659
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:16,279
Well, I guess you're right.

660
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,159
It doesn't have to be.

661
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:19,719
I would have said it did, but it clearly it doesn't.

662
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:28,920
Your own most thrownness but does I maybe it doesn't even and it doesn't even individuate you, it looks like, right?

663
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,239
I think you got me off track in a way by throwing individuate in here.

664
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:38,919
I think almost with death individuates, but almost with guilt doesn't individuate.

665
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,319
Because the individuation's already been done for you.

666
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,599
So that's death's job.

667
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:47,320
If they all had the same job, it would be sort of less interesting.

668
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,519
It doesn't say it individuates this.

669
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,600
Well, what would it be to be almost and not even be individuating?

670
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:55,640
I don't know.

671
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:58,039
Well, I see we're caught in between.

672
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:13,680
I mean, either it looks like it ought to be almost and individuating, and then it's going to be exactly the way that you but that has to do with nobody being able to die for you, nobody being able to step in for you when he does it with death.

673
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:19,519
And now, what does almost mean when it isn't individuating and it isn't isolating and all that?

674
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,039
Then you know, you did I see a hand?

675
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,799
It is just sort of architectonic.

676
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,920
We don't have to worry about it, yeah.

677
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:39,840
Guilt certainly with a conscience particularly, calls you to be authentic.

678
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:45,120
And if it's calling you to be authentic, does that individuate you?

679
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:48,880
It wouldn't individuate type of individual.

680
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,480
Well, that's what that's what Eugene is thinking.

681
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,960
It gets you away good.

682
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,119
So, okay, I see what you both are saying.

683
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:56,880
I go along with it now that I see it.

684
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,279
So, it gets you away from Dasman.

685
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:09,039
In that sense, it individuates you, even though it doesn't have this characteristic of nobody, unrelatedness and isolatedness.

686
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:09,519
Yeah.

687
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:10,480
Yeah.

688
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,319
Ah.

689
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,639
Wow, well, that's certainly a hard one.

690
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:40,879
That's very, very tough because there is something about Asine, which is this kind of minimal something or other that it has, even when it's even when it's in anxiety and paralyzed and so forth.

691
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:50,840
There is what I talk to myself about it, I say that sometimes he talks about Dasein as that it is and has to be.

692
01:04:51,159 --> 01:05:00,600
That seems to be this minimal, and that I think there's another thing, this that it is and has to be has minus.

693
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,000
Those are the, that's somehow rock bottom.

694
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,880
Minus isn't the thing that's being individuated.

695
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,840
It's, I don't know what exactly minus is.

696
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,200
Something like, well, if anybody does, they should let me know.

697
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:20,280
Sometimes I think it's it's first person perspective, but I'm not even sure that's right.

698
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:37,000
But so, and there is something, let me finish this thought, called authentic Dasein, which is not the Dasein of Dasman and not authentic Dasein either.

699
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:54,440
And Heidegger says that both authentic Daseine and inauthentic Dasman Dasein are existential modifications of something which is the existencial authentic Dasein.

700
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,319
You remember this passage?

701
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,400
We talked about this passage once, didn't we?

702
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:03,719
And that it makes it look like there's some sort of kernel.

703
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:05,639
I have no idea what to say about this.

704
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:14,680
There's some kind of something or other that Dasein has, whether it's acting in a Dasman way or paralyzed or acting in an authentic way.

705
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:21,239
And that's the thing you're talking about, I think, when it calls it back to itself.

706
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:22,519
Is that what it's the passage?

707
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,319
What is the passage?

708
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:29,199
Because the constancy of the self is a big deal, and that comes up later.

709
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,840
And for that, you have to have steadfastness and a kind of commitment and so forth.

710
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:35,840
But I don't think that's the self here.

711
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,679
Show me where the passage is.

712
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:51,519
Okay, let me read it and see if I can tell Pauling the Dasein comes back to itself, it's wanted in the is to bring itself back to itself.

713
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,519
And what is itself?

714
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,399
Well, it's worth talking about.

715
01:06:56,399 --> 01:06:57,840
Does anybody have more to say?

716
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:05,359
I think it's the that it is and has to be, in which it takes a stand on its being.

717
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:15,279
There is some being that is called to take a stand on its being, and that is its authentic, in a different sense of authentic.

718
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:16,960
There are two senses of authentic self.

719
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:26,719
There is this minimal sense of authentic self, which is what's called to take a stand on itself in its action.

720
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:39,679
And then there is the higher kind of authentic self, and that's the self that has taken a stand and got its life together, acting steadfastly and flexibly, and has a constant self.

721
01:07:40,399 --> 01:07:46,159
We know that that kind of authentic self is an existential modification of something.

722
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:55,439
Just as we know that the Dasein the the self-fleeing into Dasman is an existential modification of something.

723
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:56,640
And I don't know what to say.

724
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,439
This is the kind of thing, Curtis, where you usually have something to say.

725
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,719
Do you?

726
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:01,920
Okay.

727
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:04,960
Yeah.

728
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,159
Yeah.

729
01:08:06,479 --> 01:08:07,760
I think it's a good question.

730
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,279
We we'll try to answer you for a minute.

731
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,359
If we do, we make pro real progress.

732
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:11,760
Yeah.

733
01:08:12,399 --> 01:08:14,000
And those sound like the right words.

734
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:21,399
But can you say of that clearing that it is and has to be, that it has minus?

735
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:23,319
I don't know.

736
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:25,880
I mean, it doesn't what do you think, Yuruka?

737
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,760
Can you say something?

738
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:27,399
Yeah.

739
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:35,639
But I mean, it that's the sort of minimal s condition that the control and project itself in two ways at least, authentically and inauthentically.

740
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:36,519
Yeah.

741
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,079
There's no there's no kernel of substance of anything.

742
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:47,800
And maybe to say that it's a clearing is to say something like that.

743
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,920
That's what I meant by perspectival.

744
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:57,000
I I think of Dasein when I try to think about this as a perspectival openness on the world.

745
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,239
It can't be just sheer openness on the world because everybody's open on the world from where they are.

746
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,000
And Heidegger knows that.

747
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:14,519
And so is that the minimalist thing, that there's this perspectival clearing, which is a kind of activity?

748
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:16,840
I'm ready to hear more.

749
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,439
Yeah, Tyler.

750
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:23,559
Software put something between the existential modification.

751
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,799
Well, you can't have additional potentiality, which are co-primordials.

752
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:33,880
Then you know nothing but alternations between two existential modifications with nothing in between them.

753
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:49,639
Okay, that that's I mean I think that's good, but uh can you account for this quote where Heidegger says that uh there is that that both authenticity and inauthenticity are existential modifications of authentic Dasein?

754
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,439
Doesn't he say that?

755
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:51,479
He does say that, doesn't he?

756
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,119
Well, I'll find it.

757
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:52,680
Wait a minute.

758
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:59,000
Let's not, just a second, let's not spend our time explaining something if if it's a hallucination of mine.

759
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:07,519
Find the place at the end of Dasman chapter where he tells you that there are these two modifications.

760
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,880
168, that's it.

761
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,679
I was looking at that 68 and I wasn't finding it.

762
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,680
Okay, now, I have to find the other one.

763
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,960
But I mean, I wrote here 365.

764
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,239
Let's look at 365.

765
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:20,799
No.

766
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,680
There's a place where he talks about them as both modifications.

767
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,119
That isn't there, is it?

768
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:26,639
Modification.

769
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,039
What?

770
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,760
Oh, yeah, the authentic self, right.

771
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:42,319
It has been shown that about 15 lines from the bottom, it has been shown that proximally and for the most part, Dasein is not itself, but both in the they self, which is an existential modification of the authentic self.

772
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,800
Maybe that's just a mistake, because I don't.

773
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:54,239
Inauthentic self-what keeps it from it is this sentence.

774
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:00,800
It says that the they self is an existential modification of the authentic self.

775
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,840
Ah, maybe that's right.

776
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:24,719
It just on to me what you're saying is that these two just go back and forth, and you could even throw in that they are, that there's a third existential modification in this undifferentiated mode, that those are all sort of modifications that sort of flip back and forth among themselves, but there's no underlying anything.

777
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,639
Hmm, I never thought about that.

778
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,599
That's good.

779
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,960
I think that's right.

780
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:33,359
You have just cleared up uh something that worried me for ages.

781
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:35,760
Something I wished I'd asked Heidegger.

782
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,639
Maybe if I'd asked Heidegger, he would have told me the same thing you just told me.

783
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,479
I it would be nice to know.

784
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,559
Uh anybody else?

785
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,600
So you see the thing now.

786
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:51,399
There's no underlying uh uh self, no underlying deep authentic self.

787
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:53,960
I always tried to make it as minimal as possible.

788
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,159
But now I think it's Tyler has made it even more minimal.

789
01:11:57,159 --> 01:11:59,799
There is just this flipping back and forth.

790
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,800
And maybe we can combine Tyler with me.

791
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:07,800
Is it a flipping back and forth, Tyler, of a perspective on the world, of a perspectival way absorbed in the world?

792
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:14,840
Yeah, I think well you that fits with what you said when you came in and talked to me the other day, that we are just absorbed in the world, don't slip anything in between.

793
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,199
Now you put these two things.

794
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:27,559
We are absorbed in the world authentically or inauthentically, and there's no underlying core self, and there's certainly no mental representations in between.

795
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:36,760
So we would be j uh this active open active perspectival openness on the world or absorption in the world would be better.

796
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:46,599
Active perspectival absorption in the world which flips back and forth between being authentic, inauthentic, or undifferentiated.

797
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,599
Yeah, that's a mouthful.

798
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,719
But I like it.

799
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,639
Yeah, now somebody should run out of the room and throw up to confirm, confirm that we've got it right.

800
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,239
Uh yeah.

801
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:01,800
There's kind of modularity, this modulation between these two.

802
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,920
It's it's only the self kind of appears through things.

803
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:15,000
Okay, well w w we could jump ahead because there what where we yeah, I think wasn't it even in today's assignment, I'm trying to remember, where he finally no it isn't, but I can get there.

804
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:20,519
He tells you what the constancy of the self is, which is exactly what you're talking about.

805
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:29,199
And the constancy of the self is just the steadfastness of whatever you're permitted to.

806
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,000
I think I wrote it at the very end of my notes.

807
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:34,880
I did, so let me find steadfast, 369.

808
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,719
As long as we're on the subject, we've jumped ahead of the assignment, haven't we?

809
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,920
What were we supposed to be reading for today?

810
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:47,599
From 349 to 358.

811
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,199
Yeah, I just jumped ahead.

812
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:50,000
Never mind.

813
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,119
Read it anyway.

814
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:58,000
Here we are, if we're going to talk about the self and the subjectum, which would be just the wrong thing, of course.

815
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,319
The subjectum is the underlying core that has the properties.

816
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:03,279
That's Descartes.

817
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:04,079
That would be the race.

818
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,039
Oh, yeah, that's right.

819
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:08,239
He says that every once in a while.

820
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,679
That's part of it.

821
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,880
And why would you think that there was a self-substance?

822
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,079
Well, there is something.

823
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,800
And he's talking about it in the bottom of 369.

824
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,319
So let's read it.

825
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,880
Selfhood, I'm right in the middle of 369.

826
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:27,760
Selfhood is to be discerned existentially only in one's authentic ability to be itself.

827
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,199
That is to say, in the authenticity of Dasina's care.

828
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:38,880
In terms of care, the constancy of the self is the supposed persistence of a subjectum gets clarified.

829
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:49,039
That the phenomenon of this authentic ability to be opens our eyes to the constancy of the self in the sense of having achieved some sort of position or taken a stand, I think that means.

830
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,239
Having an issue for it.

831
01:14:52,239 --> 01:15:04,639
The constancy of the self is the double sense of steadiness and stead in the double sense of steadiness and steadfastness is the authentic counter-possibility of the non-constancy, which is irresolute falling.

832
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:09,920
Existentially, self-constancy signifies nothing other than anticipatory.

833
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,159
Oh, that's why I would mark it in my notes.

834
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:28,599
Finally, anticipatory resoluteness is brought together in that little paragraph where he brings the, he hadn't brought in the constancy and the steadiness and the steadfastness before.

835
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:37,319
The steadiness and steadfastness is crucial and it goes with the resoluteness.

836
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:51,719
The picture of this, I'm pretty sure that it is right, that I have, and I don't claim it's anything original, is that the death part, the anticipatory part, is that it gives you flexibility, he says.

837
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,920
You're ready to give anything up.

838
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,920
And the resoluteness makes you steadfast.

839
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:07,479
I don't know why the response, that the response to your throwing it is to make you steadfast.

840
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,840
And do you?

841
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,319
I mean, but that doesn't seem to be what happens.

842
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,399
Or am I making that up?

843
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,600
You look like it.

844
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:18,840
Going forward and writing forward.

845
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,079
So it's not just being willing to give things up.

846
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:21,560
It's really willing.

847
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,039
Okay.

848
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,279
It's okay, but it does the job of making you flexible.

849
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:29,639
I'm thinking of the passage about not being too old for victories.

850
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:39,639
Anticipation, meaning the possibility of having to give everything up, makes you flexible and able to give anything specific up.

851
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,639
I see, that's interesting.

852
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,000
Where is that passage?

853
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,119
Let's look for it.

854
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,759
It's in what we were talking about.

855
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:50,679
I mean, I want to know how it relates to anticipation.

856
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,960
And because I thought I I didn't read flexibility into it.

857
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,719
I I that's why I want to find it.

858
01:16:55,720 --> 01:17:04,639
It isn't just n not being too old for victories, that is taking what you can get when you sort of win.

859
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,960
But okay, let me look at three hundred eight.

860
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,119
Why do I think it's got to do with flexibility?

861
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:14,399
Ah, it's because he talks about shattering all tenaciousness to whatever existence one has reached.

862
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:18,640
That's well about ten lines from the bottom of three oh.

863
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:25,599
And he thinks it I think he wants to say that when you're acting authentically, you are neither flaky nor fanatical.

864
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:30,239
That is, that's the stick you stick with it, but you don't get stuck with it.

865
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:37,840
And he thinks that the death possibilities are really necessary or guaranteed makes you flexible.

866
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,880
And that and now this is the part I don't understand.

867
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:47,840
Knowing that you are thrown and are the null basis of a projection makes you steadfast.

868
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:48,239
Why?

869
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,880
I really don't know.

870
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:56,000
But I think that those two together is what it is.

871
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,799
By the way, this is we're talking now about the attestation or the manifestation.

872
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:06,319
What is it to manifest being anticipatory resolute?

873
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,840
How do you behave when you're anticipatorily resolute?

874
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:18,960
Then you hear about not being tenacious and being steadfast as two of the features of it.

875
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,599
Yeah.

876
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,119
That has fads, he says, right?

877
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:29,439
And I d I don't remember the stubborn, but i it certainly gets hooked on things that it keeps for ages, yeah.

878
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:35,319
But when you get away from all that, um that makes you revolute because you're not just uh you're not being.

879
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:36,399
That's the fascinated.

880
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:37,840
That's a fast move.

881
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:46,840
I mean, I could see you getting away from the the flakiness of Dasman without becoming you could become fanatical.

882
01:18:46,840 --> 01:19:04,359
You could become, I don't know, I mean, that's to be steadfast is to commit yourself to something that you are, that really defines you until it becomes impossible and you have to give it up.

883
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,639
Yes, it's not being distracted.

884
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,279
And the Dasman is always distracted.

885
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:13,479
Okay, but and why, but then that's a big jump.

886
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:23,399
So being accepting your being guilty, which is that your null basis of annullity gets you out of Dasman.

887
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:37,000
We talk a lot about that, and gets you into, now I'm getting to trying to get used to that, into committing your thing, some yourself to something and sticking with it in a way that Dasman doesn't do.

888
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,439
But why do you do that?

889
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,880
That's just how it is.

890
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:48,600
I mean, that's not what I could see that it's what the one doesn't do, but why is it that accepting your null basis of annullity makes you guilty?

891
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:57,880
Okay, and it's we have a natural tendency to take a stand on our being and stick to that stand and theme.

892
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,279
Why, I don't quite know.

893
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:01,399
But let's go on.

894
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:03,720
Somebody, did I see your hand up, Tyler?

895
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,799
Somebody had a hand up over here.

896
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:11,880
Okay, well, I want to fill in the missing piece because maybe when you see it, you'll have an answer to it.

897
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:23,880
But I remember that I made notes here and we just haven't come to them yet, where he makes the move to steadfastness in effect.

898
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,079
To let me try to see where we are.

899
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:37,920
Well, we're trying to look at how you, when you manifest your, the fact that you can't get behind your throwiness.

900
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,880
That's where we should be.

901
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,719
So, let me see where I am.

902
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,039
349.

903
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:46,960
There's a place where he's, I'll just sort of help him thinking out loud.

904
01:20:46,960 --> 01:21:08,159
What I'm looking for is a place where he says that, in effect, because something, he's trying to explain why we are constant in our behavior, and he's saying that there is the constant threat.

905
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:11,599
I think it's anticipation that makes us constant.

906
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,439
That's odd.

907
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:14,719
Now, I have to find it.

908
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:24,639
He talks about he makes a move to constancy on the basis of something that I have to find.

909
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,880
5353.

910
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,439
Ah, constant, yeah, yeah, this is it.

911
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:33,039
And he does it, as I thought, on the basis of guilty.

912
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:44,000
Now, how does he get, this is the thing I was talking to Eugene about, how does he get from accepting being guilty to having something constant in your life?

913
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,159
He does it by saying, well, being guilty is something constant in your life.

914
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:56,719
So, if you're going to act in such a way as to manifest your being guilty, then you better act in such a way as to have something constant in your life.

915
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,920
That doesn't seem right.

916
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:00,960
Maybe I'm making that up.

917
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,239
Did you see the paragraph?

918
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,359
He doesn't say that?

919
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,719
Let's hope not.

920
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:06,800
Everybody read on their own.

921
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,000
What's going on on 353?

922
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:12,719
So he doesn't get, I guess I'm wrong.

923
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:17,319
He doesn't get the constancy out of the fact that you're constantly guilty.

924
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:25,399
He just says that you should constantly express in whatever you do that you are guilty.

925
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:28,199
And that is okay.

926
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,719
I'm still worried about that.

927
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:38,840
All this about taking it back and and not becoming rigid is on 355.

928
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:49,319
He's going back to that again, only in the context of, well, now he's doing anticipatory resoluteness, he says, at the bottom of 354.

929
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:53,079
And he's telling you about flexibility.

930
01:22:53,079 --> 01:22:55,639
And he ought to be telling you about constancy.

931
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,119
Resolving to keep repeating itself.

932
01:22:58,119 --> 01:23:07,559
Is that just repeating that it's thrown a null basis of a nullity or some specific commitment?

933
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:22,039
No, I don't see any place where he tries to derive or claims to have shown why we are called to be constant or steadfast.

934
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,479
That's what we're looking for.

935
01:23:23,479 --> 01:23:24,199
Okay, let's see.

936
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:25,479
What page is that?

937
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:30,199
One one okay, well that was exactly where I tried to get it.

938
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:31,000
And I didn't get it.

939
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,399
Did you?

940
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,760
When do you look at the possibility of that?

941
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,079
And you you think that's fa g fast move or or it's okay?

942
01:23:39,079 --> 01:23:43,159
Yeah, I wrote I wrote down fast move for exact exactly that point.

943
01:23:43,159 --> 01:23:46,920
It seems like it's but that does seem to be what he's doing it.

944
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:49,800
Now lower down on that page he does just the opposite.

945
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:55,639
He gets he gets the view that you should you're constantly flexible and never became become rigid.

946
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:59,000
Ah the yeah, and the certainty well, how does that play in that?

947
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:06,079
These, by the way, are the absolute when I'm I began when I came in saying I do not understand what is going on.

948
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:19,920
It was in in 354, 355, around here, where he brings together anticipation and thoroughness or or resoluteness, and gets anticipatory resoluteness.

949
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:27,519
Then everything seems to be just turning around in a way that I don't know even what the what the argument's supposed to be.

950
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:37,359
But out of it becomes being able to not become rigid and but not be resolute either.

951
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:41,439
I mean you're resolute either, so you're resolute but not rigid.

952
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:44,639
And that's about it.

953
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,880
Okay, I want you to talk about a third thing.

954
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,399
Let me just look my page numbers, because then I will talk about the third thing I want to talk about.

955
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:54,880
343.

956
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,239
No, that's okay.

957
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,359
Well, does anybody know this is a different thing, but maybe we can get it off the table in a hurry.

958
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:04,559
Oh, this we've all solved the problem of wholeness.

959
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,840
It looks to me like never solves the problem of wholeness.

960
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,639
I don't know what the problem of wholeness was, but whatever it was, it looks like it's still around.

961
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:17,760
And every once in a while he says we haven't solved the problem of wholeness, and then he goes on for a few more pages.

962
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:23,840
So I think the wholeness is a fake problem that he got at the beginning in this funny methodological way.

963
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:30,639
And then he claimed and then he says, look, we have to have Dasein as your whole, but Dasein is always outstanding part of it.

964
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,880
And so how are we going to deal with that?

965
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:50,679
And so, what he tells you is there's a common, there's a, instead of wholeness, there's a an authentic Dazine has constancy and a unified way of working, namely flexible and steadfast.

966
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,559
But I don't see that that tells you that it's it's whole.

967
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,680
I don't even know what it means.

968
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,159
You look you think it's all the problem of whole?

969
01:25:57,399 --> 01:26:01,640
When I get that, I'll say you see your thoughts the whole arrangement.

970
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,039
You see all of it how do you see all of it?

971
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:05,559
I don't understand here.

972
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,079
Does he really say that?

973
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:10,119
Isn't that that sort of strange?

974
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,319
How can it know that?

975
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:12,680
It's sort of clairvoyant?

976
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:16,920
I mean, so the you know you look like you know something.

977
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,479
No?

978
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:17,880
Okay.

979
01:26:18,199 --> 01:26:21,399
Well, okay, I don't know what to say about that.

980
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,159
So I'm going to go on to what I want to say one more thing about.

981
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,920
I say, here, I just don't know how to get deal with wholeness.

982
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,279
And but now I want to say, this is the last thing.

983
01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:36,679
I'm trying to make my case that he's got the book in this screwed up order.

984
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:42,519
And finally, he sort of faces all these weird questions which he shouldn't have to face on 349.

985
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,039
Remember what the issue is.

986
01:26:44,039 --> 01:27:17,960
I mean, I claim that if he had only done resoluteness first, and then he could have said, and that he and the extremist form of resoluteness is anticipatory resoluteness, because I think he should have said, resoluteness shows you the ungroundedness of the shared practices and you're you're no way able to justify the shared practices, but that anticipatory resoluteness shows the the the ungroundedness of the whole culture.

987
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:22,920
And then and then he could have and and that would, see.

988
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,599
I'm not being very clear, but I'll get, I'll become clear.

989
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:40,159
So he he tries to claim that somehow anticipation is somehow the most extreme form of resoluteness.

990
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,079
And he keeps saying that.

991
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:48,319
And yet, he does anticipation before he does resoluteness.

992
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:50,719
So I think he's right.

993
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:56,479
Anticipation is the most extreme form of resoluteness, because in death you take everything back.

994
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:01,679
And somehow that's more extreme than not getting behind your throneness.

995
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:11,599
But now I want to just point out, maybe nobody disagrees with me, and I'm just filting at windmills, but what he's constantly saying, maybe nobody disagrees.

996
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:27,119
I want to say he constantly says that anticipation is sort of the extremest form of resoluteness, and that it's kind of the teleology of resoluteness, that resoluteness hasn't gone all the way.

997
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:34,639
But if you go all the way with resoluteness, then you, and you get it wholly, then you get anticipatory resoluteness.

998
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:41,439
Now, maybe nobody, and the only reason I want to stress that is, is that I want to say that's my evidence that we're in the wrong order.

999
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:51,439
If resoluteness isn't the, just goes halfway, so to speak, to anticipatory resoluteness, then stick with doing it.

1000
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:52,960
Well, now let me give you quotes.

1001
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:59,439
I mean, he's one thing you get all these questions, how in the world do you get death together with a concrete situation?

1002
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:04,239
How do you get the two phenomena of anticipation and resoluteness brought together?

1003
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:10,399
And then it does, and then he gives his sort of answer near the bottom, in italics.

1004
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:19,799
Does resoluteness in its almost existential tendency of being point forward to anticipatory resoluteness as its own most authentic possibility?

1005
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:31,479
That's what I call this sort of teleological claim that resoluteness sort of works itself out as anticipation.

1006
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,799
It's on page 350 also.

1007
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,239
Well, no, he's just talking again.

1008
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:42,039
He's how are we going to get resoluteness together with anticipation?

1009
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:47,719
And he's going to know how to do it in a non-arbitrary way.

1010
01:29:48,359 --> 01:30:01,399
And he says every once in a while, I'll just read you one more time, how it's a sort of teleological story, that resoluteness is, if it's fully worked out, gets you anticipation.

1011
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:16,439
On 352 at the bottom, when resoluteness has been thought through to the end in a way corresponding to its own most tendency of being, see, that's what I call the teleology, to what extent does it lead us to authentic being towards death?

1012
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:18,279
How are we to conceive the connection?

1013
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,599
Well, somehow we're supposed to.

1014
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:38,279
We're supposed to understand that the full or extreme form of resoluteness, which is the, and it's been defined as accepting your guilt, which means defined as understanding that you're a basis, the null basis melody.

1015
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:43,159
How does all that get you to anticipation?

1016
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:44,599
It doesn't.

1017
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:52,760
I mean, you have to throw in death to get from guilt and resoluteness to anticipatory resoluteness.

1018
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,920
That's what death does.

1019
01:30:55,239 --> 01:31:12,239
And so in another way, at the bottom of the middle paragraph on 353, resoluteness does not just have a connection with anti-it harbors in itself authentic being toward it as the possible existential modality of its own.

1020
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,119
And then he says we should elicit this phenomenologically.

1021
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:18,719
But I don't think he ever does.

1022
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:24,159
But first, I just want to sh tell you that, notice that he does, he's got this claim.

1023
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:32,559
And then when you want to find out what the claim is on 354 and 355, it is extremely murky.

1024
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,639
But you hear it again at the top of 354, third line.

1025
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:43,680
Resoluteness is primordially that which it tends to be.

1026
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,719
Sorry, what is that?

1027
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,799
It maintains itself authentically.

1028
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,760
And if resoluteness is primarily what it tends to be, that means what?

1029
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,159
That resoluteness turns into death.

1030
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:54,559
Yeah.

1031
01:31:54,800 --> 01:32:03,599
But we have revealed that Dasein's primordial being towards its potentiality, its ability to be, is being towards death, and so forth.

1032
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:12,639
And thus only as anticipating does resoluteness become a primordial being towards Dasein's almost ability to be.

1033
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:18,399
All of this is that, and now the question is, what's the phenomena that he's got?

1034
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:28,079
Why does he want to say that resoluteness is, so to speak, the tendency toward anticipatory resoluteness?

1035
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:30,799
Did he ever, I don't think he ever explains it.

1036
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,279
If he does, I've missed it.

1037
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,880
And he's moving very fast through there.

1038
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,359
But he could have explained it.

1039
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:53,880
And I think what it ought to be, what it ought to be, and I just already, and it's in the paper I gave you, that if you try to figure it out, then you could say that, remember, that resoluteness goes with the frontimus.

1040
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,679
It goes with response to the unique situation.

1041
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,599
It goes with taking action.

1042
01:33:00,359 --> 01:33:14,119
And that's what manifests the fact that the frontimus, the resolute Dasein, is no longer just doing what one does and responding to the general situation, but responding to the unique situation.

1043
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:25,479
But I think that if you define it that way and describe it that way, then resoluteness is on the background of a culture that's taken for granted.

1044
01:33:25,479 --> 01:33:36,039
And what I really think is that the frontimis and the resoluteness story is the Greek half of his story, and that's fine.

1045
01:33:36,039 --> 01:33:49,799
And what he thinks is, just to put it very provocatively, sort of Christianity is the teleology of Greece, or the Aristotelian frontimus is some step toward Jesus.

1046
01:33:50,279 --> 01:34:05,799
What I mean by that crazy claim is that he thinks that you need to understand the possibility of total world collapse, which is meaning that your whole culture, the whole Greek antique world could disappear and the new Christian world could come along.

1047
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,239
He hasn't really fully worked that out yet, but he will.

1048
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:17,479
And then he'll say, and that, Jane, in Carol White will say that the medieval world has to die so that the modern world can be born.

1049
01:34:17,479 --> 01:34:19,399
It's that that he's heading toward.

1050
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:37,279
Let me say it again: that the resoluteness just tells you you should not do, don't do what one does because it looks like it's the right thing to do, and now with Tyler's correction of me, and don't do the opposite of what one does as if that was the right thing to do.

1051
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:42,719
It's all all, from resoluteness, you get the phronomus who just does the appropriate thing.

1052
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:51,519
It's neither what one does or opposed to what one does, and it doesn't even have any generalization like chairs are just in on each situation.

1053
01:34:51,520 --> 01:35:00,159
The phronomist does the appropriate thing on the background of a Greek understanding of what it is to be a human being.

1054
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:07,759
The phronomist doesn't call into question the ungroundedness of the culture.

1055
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:16,239
It just calls into question the ungroundedness of all anything that one does when one responds to the general situation.

1056
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:21,679
To call into question the ungroundedness of the culture would be world collapse.

1057
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,960
And that's death.

1058
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:33,039
I mean, the death part of it is that all your possibilities could be annihilated, or all the possibilities of the culture could be annihilated.

1059
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:36,159
And then you'd have a whole new world.

1060
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,319
And you don't get that in being in time.

1061
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:44,079
That's why he's got all this squeamishness about tendencies and teleologies and stuff.

1062
01:35:44,319 --> 01:36:00,159
I'm telling a story in which it makes perfect sense to say that you haven't wholly understood the phronomus and the anxiety of guilt until you go all the way and understand the ungroundedness of all the background practices that make up the culture.

1063
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:18,599
So when he keeps saying anticipation, the right way of expressing Dasein's mortality is the full form of the ungroundedness and therefore transformableness of everything.

1064
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:43,559
And so he will say things like, otherwise I don't know how we can explain how the death and anticipation are somehow already implicit as the tendency of resoluteness and that full resoluteness will be the total will be living in terms of the possibility of total world collapse.

1065
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,159
He gets that far.

1066
01:36:45,159 --> 01:36:58,439
Now I'm just trying to say what he does when he gets that far is really move from Greek to Christian or in the paper I gave you from Kairos to Augenblich where Kairos is the feet of the moment.

1067
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:00,279
That's what the phronymist does.

1068
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:05,159
Augenblich is how the whole world is changed in the twinkling of an eye.

1069
01:37:05,159 --> 01:37:08,039
It's what Augenblich is, is the twinkling of an eye.

1070
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:09,639
And that's a Christian concept.

1071
01:37:10,039 --> 01:37:18,039
Aristotle and the Greeks never, and the phronomists never thought that the whole civilization could be changed into another civilization.

1072
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:19,799
They thought they had the right one.

1073
01:37:20,039 --> 01:37:21,159
Now somebody had a hand up.

1074
01:37:21,159 --> 01:37:22,039
Yeah, go ahead, James.

1075
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:24,439
I see.

1076
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:26,600
The phronymist is resolute grounded.

1077
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:44,840
Yeah, but notice that somehow, yes, but only the relative ungroundedness somehow, the ungroundedness of the current, the general remember the phronomist responds to the unique situation, not the general situation.

1078
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:50,840
But if you picture the pharmaceut responding to the unique situation, it's on the background of lots of shared practices.

1079
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:52,840
But then you're on the right track.

1080
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:59,439
He thinks that if you pushed it all the way, you would have to see that everything would contingent.

1081
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:02,319
All the practices, the whole culture was contingent.

1082
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:05,920
But I don't think that when the pharmaceutical does see that.

1083
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:11,039
That's the sense in which here's the question.

1084
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:19,840
In what sense is resoluteness not fully understanding the human condition until you add the anticipatory?

1085
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,239
And I'm trying to say what I think that means.

1086
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:30,399
What I'm wanting to get clear about, I mean, is it how much you can see the part of resoluteness from an understanding of guilt?

1087
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:41,600
I mean, but okay, well, I see the point about that constant you have to hear where he said, you know, whoever Dotland is essentially guilty, not just guilty on human engagement, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1088
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:47,199
To project oneself upon this being guilty, which Darling is as wrong as it is.

1089
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,319
That's all true.

1090
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:56,639
And yet, somehow, resoluteness is not, there's something missing from resoluteness that only death and anticipation can add.

1091
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:08,719
Something that resoluteness is tending toward, and if you pushed it all the way, would be, namely, the total ground the sense of the groundlessness of everything.

1092
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:22,159
But there must be something that he thinks resoluteness hasn't got because he thinks that it's got this, what is it, this teleology story, that if that if it was fully worked out, it would be anticipatory.

1093
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:24,479
And it isn't fully worked out.

1094
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:32,319
If you just live in resoluteness, you you don't call, I think, you don't call into question your culture.

1095
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:37,719
We want to say that Dotland can be resolute.

1096
01:39:38,039 --> 01:39:43,239
And resoluteness is the projection of being guilty.

1097
01:39:43,399 --> 01:39:43,559
Yeah.

1098
01:39:44,439 --> 01:39:45,079
There's something.

1099
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:46,439
It doesn't go all the way.

1100
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:49,960
I mean, remember the lines that say something like it isn't holy, it isn't complete.

1101
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:54,840
It's got a tendency, but it hasn't realized its tendency.

1102
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:55,399
All of that.

1103
01:39:55,399 --> 01:39:57,720
That means that...

1104
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:01,000
And again, I only feel at home when I understand the phenomenon.

1105
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,479
The phronomist never goes all the way.

1106
01:40:03,479 --> 01:40:11,639
The phronomists believe that the Athenians are the highest human beings and are rational animals and that we are or whatever.

1107
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:16,679
There's a whole lot of taken-for-granted stuff that the phronomist doesn't question.

1108
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,079
It's what Aristotle teaches in his ethics course.

1109
01:40:19,399 --> 01:40:21,319
Ah, well, he called the phronomist resolute.

1110
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:34,359
Well, you see, no, but the reason I think that is not only because he uses the terms of responding to the unique situation and all the sort of jargon of phronesis, but that's not the important thing.

1111
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:45,479
He says there's something that resoluteness hasn't gone all the way, that it isn't complete, that it has a tendency, but you haven't gone all the way till you add anticipatory.

1112
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:50,359
Anticipatory has to do with death, and death has to do with total world collapse, I think.

1113
01:40:51,079 --> 01:40:51,559
Tyler.

1114
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:56,199
It's what?

1115
01:41:01,399 --> 01:41:02,279
Hopefully responsible.

1116
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:03,399
I see.

1117
01:41:03,399 --> 01:41:05,319
Okay, but then good, maybe.

1118
01:41:05,319 --> 01:41:07,479
But tell me the story again in what scheme?

1119
01:41:14,039 --> 01:41:16,920
Is the fully worked out implications of resolution?

1120
01:41:17,479 --> 01:41:17,880
Okay.

1121
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:18,760
Okay.

1122
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:25,399
Well, not only belongs to false and healthy won't hold on to the...

1123
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,159
Wow.

1124
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:43,359
Well, wait, stop with that.

1125
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:46,559
I mean, if that's if he does say that, that's very interesting.

1126
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:48,960
You say to make a really interesting, strong claim.

1127
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:55,920
I doubt if he says it, but you want to make resoluteness existential and anticipation existential.

1128
01:41:56,479 --> 01:41:58,800
Concretely and all content.

1129
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,519
No longer don't be resoluteness.

1130
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:06,880
That concrete manifestation is made possible by an authorized construction, which all of them do.

1131
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:09,279
Well, I we should keep a look.

1132
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:11,279
I don't, I mean, show me the text.

1133
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:16,159
I I don't believe it, but but I but it's got the same kind of general point that I have.

1134
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:19,760
You've got to have some way of trying to say what it is that resolution is.

1135
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,559
Resoluteness has something, but it doesn't have everything.

1136
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,960
And then you get at anticipation, you add something more.

1137
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,039
Eugene wants to say something, and then Tom.

1138
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:28,720
No, no, come on, you I'm sure you did.

1139
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,439
I did.

1140
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:30,319
We got time.

1141
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:38,639
I think maybe I really say what the funnel does, he does together with the culture, what the culture calls.

1142
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:44,880
I think that's the the the funnels is in touch with his culture is like because the resoluteness.

1143
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:47,359
That's right.

1144
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:57,119
But he's it's Heidegger who threw in all of his astronomers stuff about responding to the unique situation as what you do when you manifest resoluteness.

1145
01:42:57,119 --> 01:42:59,199
He does seem to be saying that.

1146
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:01,840
Or maybe I'm reading that in.

1147
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,079
But that might be the difference.

1148
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:06,559
Okay.

1149
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:09,840
We have to look it up, but let me tell everybody else in less code.

1150
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:13,519
I mean, it's true that the astronomers does what he does for the sake of the good.

1151
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:19,479
Interestingly enough, Heidegger leaves it out when he does the phenomenology of the phronomist responding to the unique situation.

1152
01:43:19,479 --> 01:43:26,679
But I put it in because I think Heidegger knows it, and I don't think he would want to leave wants to, you know, needs to leave it out.

1153
01:43:27,079 --> 01:43:46,920
But the question is: if the phronomist then would have to either not be fully resolute, because he's still buying into the Athenian idea of the good, or my way of understanding it is that somehow resoluteness doesn't go all the way.

1154
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:50,760
I don't know why, but it looks like he keeps saying resolut.

1155
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:58,519
It isn't just the phronomus, it's resoluteness, which has a tendency to be wholly manifest in anticipation.

1156
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:02,039
Why can't resoluteness wholly manifest its own itself?

1157
01:44:03,239 --> 01:44:08,119
What is it that anticipation manifests that resolution lacks?

1158
01:44:08,119 --> 01:44:09,960
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

1159
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,920
It could, okay, but then I'm interested in the resoluteness one.

1160
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:16,760
I only the phronomist one was just my entrance into the resoluteness.

1161
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:29,559
The question really is: what is incomplete about resoluteness, which is on the right track and tends toward anticipatory resoluteness, but lacks something that anticipatory resoluteness has?

1162
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:30,920
That's the question.

1163
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:32,359
And I don't know the answer.

1164
01:44:32,359 --> 01:44:33,399
But you haven't said anything.

1165
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:34,359
You can say something.

1166
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:34,920
That's right.

1167
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,960
Anticipation organizes your activity.

1168
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,039
That seems to be right, that's sure.

1169
01:44:40,039 --> 01:44:52,519
But then for the third question, now that you have that leadway that there's more authenticity, it seems like that there's no organization built in there.

1170
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,199
You can just respond.

1171
01:44:54,199 --> 01:44:57,559
You can keep responding to the closest possible way.

1172
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:58,039
I see.

1173
01:44:58,039 --> 01:45:06,720
You wouldn't say the anticipation organizes the whole of your life under some one of the up to the end and so forth.

1174
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,159
Yes, that might be right.

1175
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,840
That's not not different from Tyler either in a way.

1176
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:27,199
What you're doing, all three of you, or at least both of you, I don't know about Eugene Piette, is saying, well, there's something about a f fully authentic human life that resoluteness lacks, that being towards death adds.

1177
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:31,840
It's not about culture and whether you radically question your culture at all.

1178
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,359
I'm beginning to be convinced.

1179
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:36,239
And your way of putting it is helpful.

1180
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:51,119
So it's not enough that moment by moment with resoluteness, the frondomist constantly, but each time just punctually, at each moment, does the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

1181
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:54,719
He's got no unified long-range life.

1182
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:57,840
There's nothing about the constancy of the frondomist.

1183
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:04,319
If he has anything, he has a lot of flexibility, but it's not the kind that Heidegger's interested in.

1184
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:09,119
So, and you're saying, aha, and what do you add when you add anticipatory?

1185
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:17,519
You add that somehow the style of your life, let's put it, from beginning to end, is a life of a mortal.

1186
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:22,159
And that's beyond what the Aristotelian frondimist has.

1187
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:32,639
He doesn't have a style of life that goes from beginning to end, or at least that kind of style that expresses the deepest nature of what it is to be a human being.

1188
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:38,000
You don't have that unless you have anticipatory resoluteness.

1189
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:54,039
And Heidegger doesn't tell us that the Frontimus doesn't have it, but I think it sort of is clearer the way it's positioned in the book that the Fronymus is manifesting resoluteness and that resoluteness hasn't got everything that it needs.

1190
01:46:54,039 --> 01:46:56,119
It hasn't got anticipatory.

1191
01:46:56,119 --> 01:46:58,519
And I'm agreeing with you completely, and both of you.

1192
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:02,519
And when it gets anticipatory, it becomes the style of a whole life.

1193
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:22,039
And that's a radically different issue than my issue, which might be right too, but not Heidegger's, that of questioning sort of from within the culture and being there or seeing the contingency of the whole culture.

1194
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,960
That's not what's on Heidegger's mind at this point.

1195
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:31,159
I'm really bringing later Heidegger in when I talk about world collapse.

1196
01:47:31,159 --> 01:47:32,759
Okay, yes, right.

1197
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,399
Well, of course, it all points to temporality.

1198
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:51,479
Your exposure displays that the possibilities of Profanity are not just significant from here and now, but they're being projected onto an end that's the current possibility in our actual life.

1199
01:47:51,479 --> 01:47:59,159
So it's almost like, yeah, you're free from Dasma, but you're not yet supporting yourself.

1200
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:00,840
That's probably true, though.

1201
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:05,880
I'm not keeping an eye open, but I don't think he's going to bring that up when he gets to temporality.

1202
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,960
That isn't what interests him about temporality.

1203
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:14,279
When he gets to temporality, it's going to be a structure of a more abstract kind of structure.

1204
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:17,399
But it's not incompatible with what he thinks about temporality.

1205
01:48:18,039 --> 01:48:19,000
Do you want to say something?

1206
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,799
Resoluteness gets you.

1207
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,079
Yeah, that's what it seems.

1208
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:25,800
Is that right or is it the other way?

1209
01:48:26,119 --> 01:48:28,119
Which gets you flexibility?

1210
01:48:28,119 --> 01:48:30,319
No, the death gets you flexibility, right?

1211
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:33,039
All your possibility, you have to be ready to give up.

1212
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:38,399
Any and every possibility is give upable.

1213
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:41,119
That's when I see, let's see, the promise.

1214
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:42,000
Goodness.

1215
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,599
Now, the promise.

1216
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:45,840
Where's the two old for victory?

1217
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,239
Is that in the resolute or in the anticipatory?

1218
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:50,559
Because that's the flexibility one.

1219
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,679
I would have thought, I'm just trying to think out loud to myself.

1220
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:59,039
I would have liked it to be death.

1221
01:48:59,039 --> 01:48:59,920
What then?

1222
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,279
Both can get you both.

1223
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:04,720
Okay, well, I don't.

1224
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,319
I doubt it, but I'm not sure yet.

1225
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:07,039
Well, you think so, too?

1226
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,439
Get to the wholeness thing, right?

1227
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:11,519
But what gets you flexibility?

1228
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:13,039
Steadiness.

1229
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:16,239
Steadfastness is on 369.

1230
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:17,519
Let's see what that is.

1231
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,759
The constancy of the self.

1232
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,439
What gets you that?

1233
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:24,319
Anticipatory resoluteness gets you the constancy.

1234
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:26,800
It says at the bottom on 369.

1235
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:29,279
So that's not going to help much.

1236
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:31,599
And maybe that fits with what Tyler said.

1237
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,920
Okay, so both gets you both.

1238
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:43,599
Anticipation gets you the whole, and you don't have the whole until you get to anticipation, and resoluteness hasn't got you there yet.

1239
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:50,960
And the question, so all I'm learning from all of you, but the one thing I don't give up is that the book is in the wrong order.

1240
01:49:52,880 --> 01:50:14,920
No, because I want to say no, because if resoluteness is incomplete and doesn't get you wholeness and doesn't get you constancy, then you ought to start with the thing that is incomplete but has the teleology of getting to wholeness and getting to constancy and explain it and then show that it still hasn't got you there.

1241
01:50:15,159 --> 01:50:21,479
Then you can go from resoluteness to death to anticipation.

1242
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:30,039
Instead of getting this screamy thing where you go start you start with death and it's interrupted by resoluteness, then you come back to anticipation.

1243
01:50:30,039 --> 01:50:31,479
Why should we do it that way?

1244
01:50:32,039 --> 01:50:33,399
Well, how is any of them motivated?

1245
01:50:34,119 --> 01:50:34,439
Okay.

1246
01:50:39,479 --> 01:50:41,399
Well, why would resoluteness get you the whole?

1247
01:50:41,399 --> 01:50:42,599
Or did I mishear you?

1248
01:50:43,159 --> 01:50:43,319
Yes.

1249
01:50:47,479 --> 01:50:53,159
The conscience, yeah, conscience could be there with the death part.

1250
01:50:53,560 --> 01:51:00,519
I'm only only rooting for guilt and the guilt part to be the first of the moves.

1251
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,599
And I don't see why you have to motivate it.

1252
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:06,279
I mean, all you have to do is say, now we haven't understood yet.

1253
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:15,159
Because you never really get the motivation is so flaky anyway, or so unclear what the wholeness is and why we need it and how we got it.

1254
01:51:15,159 --> 01:51:19,239
Why can't you just say, now we're going to describe what authentic dash is like and look at that?

1255
01:51:19,239 --> 01:51:20,439
There's guilt.

1256
01:51:20,439 --> 01:51:25,079
Well, because we're going to look at the temporal structure of it.

1257
01:51:25,079 --> 01:51:27,960
But if you want further, that's the real reason.

1258
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,439
You want a sort of fake reason.

1259
01:51:30,439 --> 01:51:38,039
I mean, because you need guilt and thrownness to do the past, and you need anticipation to do the primordial future.

1260
01:51:38,119 --> 01:51:39,960
You're going to have to bring them in somehow.

1261
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,319
Let him say the last word.

1262
01:51:41,319 --> 01:51:42,840
And then I run it 4:30.

1263
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:43,880
Yeah, you get the word.

1264
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:46,279
Right.

1265
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:50,599
That's a funny, funny way to put it, but yes, I think that's right.

1266
01:51:50,640 --> 01:52:00,239
It's a it's a you you you are able to do, to get a th the view of the whole way your life is from beginning to end, namely, vulnerable.

1267
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:03,840
And uh that th that's at least how it looks to me.

1268
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:05,279
Is that how it looks to you?

1269
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:07,039
I mean I I don't know, you look puzzled.

1270
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:12,159
Uh anyway, uh I I promised I would stop at four thirty, so I've got to stop.

1271
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:12,960
But that's okay.

1272
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,640
We'll come back to this then.

1273
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:15,119
Thanks.

1274
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:22,800
I mean, I've s I've I've learned a huge amount, mostly to take back most of what I thought, but that's already progress.
