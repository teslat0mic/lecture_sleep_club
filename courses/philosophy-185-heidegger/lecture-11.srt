1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,119
But let's go back first to what I want to call, and you probably have in other philosophy courses already heard of, the problem of other minds.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,760
How many have come across the problem of other minds?

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,639
Okay, well, Heidegger has a strong view about the problem of other minds.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,639
Not an answer, but a kind of outrage that people treat it as a problem.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,320
He has the same kind of outrage about the problem of the external world.

6
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,960
How many have come across the problem of the external world?

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,719
Okay, well, naturally, that's really why I wanted you to take 25B, because you have to understand what he's against.

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,079
You understand a philosopher, I think, always by having to understand what it is they're against.

9
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,639
What, if they're right, must turn out to be wrong.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,319
And that's what we have to talk about.

11
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:58,199
And I mentioned last time, and I reread it, and it's still so neat that I thought I would just bring it and read it.

12
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,840
You're here where there are problems of other minds, problems of the external world.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,879
You're also, you don't know it as much yet because you're undergraduates, mostly are not graduate students.

14
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:19,639
But this is a whole industry of sort of normal philosophy knows what the normal problems are, and people write PhDs to answer them or to propose how to help with them.

15
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:22,919
And Heidegger thinks this is all outrageous.

16
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:27,800
And what we should have, he says, this is a 19, when is this?

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,199
1920.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,759
I always, there are so many, so many different times.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,520
Well, I'm always, it's about 1925.

20
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,159
Anyway, he's getting, he's sort of running up to writing being in time.

21
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,919
And he's giving this course, and this, he starts out saying that he's going to ask questions, not have problems.

22
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,839
He says, putting forth questions.

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:07,479
Questions are not happenstance thoughts, nor are questions common problems of today, which one picks up from hearsay and book learning and decks out with a gesture of profundity.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,760
Questions grow out of confrontation with the subject matter.

25
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,319
That for him always means the phenomena.

26
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,159
And the subject matter is there only where eyes are.

27
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:29,280
It is in this manner that a number of questions will have to be posed, questions, in this course, and all the more so considering that questions have today fallen out of fashion in the great industry of problems.

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,799
One stands up for nothing more than the trouble-free running of the industry.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,000
Normal science, normal philosophy.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:48,639
Having become ripe for the organization of that, philosophy interprets its corruption, that is, turning everything into problems, as quote, the resurrection of metaphysics.

31
00:02:48,639 --> 00:03:00,159
What's funny really is that Heidegger's complaining about the epistemology, which has the problem of mostly of the external world, but also of other minds.

32
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,880
And he's complaining also that the solution is to flip over and do metaphysics.

33
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,160
And that's ever since I've been around, that's been going on.

34
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,760
It's just when I was a graduate student, everybody was doing epistemology.

35
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,800
That was the question.

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,040
It was a required course, absolutely required of every major.

37
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,280
And then they throw, after a long time of getting nowhere, they decided, no, no, the problem isn't how we know everything.

38
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:28,719
It's a problem about what things are.

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,719
We should be doing metaphysics.

40
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,200
So, I don't know, maybe 15 years or 20 ago, people flipped over.

41
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,160
We don't have epistemology as a requirement anymore.

42
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,920
It's only an option.

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,920
And metaphysics got to be in charge.

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,279
And now, as far as when my colleagues talk about what we need to hire somebody in, they always say, well, we need more people in ME.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,879
ME is metaphysics and epistemology right now.

46
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:07,680
The only difference is, it seems right now, instead of flipping back and forth as if you surely knew which one you wanted was the right thing the philosophy industry should be doing, the philosophy industry is a little confused as to which it should be doing.

47
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
So it goes back and forth.

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:17,160
I mean, so it covers both, okay, a little more from this book, The Hermeneutics of Facticity, because he's so clear and upfront here.

49
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Okay, this should be sort of hanging over us as we read it.

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,439
I may have read this before, but I don't think so.

51
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:32,120
There's a section in his course called Misunderstandings, and the first thing in that section is called The Subject-Object Schema.

52
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,879
He says, This schema must be avoided.

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,839
And then this is the schema that must be avoided.

54
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,000
And it's about ten sentences long.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,480
It'll sound very familiar to you.

56
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,120
It's the schema that produces the problems.

57
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,000
Here it is.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,199
Here's the schema.

59
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,319
What exists are subjects and objects, consciousness and being.

60
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,360
Being is the object of consciousness.

61
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,960
Being in the authentic sense is the being of nature.

62
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,959
That would be what science tells us.

63
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:11,000
Consciousness is an I think, an ego, an egopo, a center of acts.

64
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:25,399
And consciousness has standing opposite beings, objects, natural things, things of value, goods, goods meaning more kinds of value, I think.

65
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,159
And then the relation between subject and object needs to be explained.

66
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:32,199
It is a problem for epistemology.

67
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,519
That's all amazing.

68
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm going to read you two more things.

69
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,000
I mean, it would be more striking to you.

70
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,120
The more you hang around in philosophy, the more this will strike you as absolutely amazing.

71
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,280
So, I'm now on 63 of the hermeneutics of facticity.

72
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:54,360
No modification of this schema, that is the subject-object schema, would be able to do away with its inappropriateness.

73
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:06,719
The schema itself is developed historically within a tradition from different constructions of each of its components, subject and object, which proceeded in isolation from one another and were then integrated in various ways.

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:24,959
The dominance of this epistemological problem, that is, how your subjects get to know the external world or get to know other subjects, is characteristic of a widely observed kind of activity through which academic disciplines, especially philosophy, gain a foothold in life and preserve themselves.

75
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:37,200
90% of the literature is preoccupied with ensuring that such wrong-headed problems do not disappear and are confounded in still more and in ever-new ways.

76
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,959
Such literature dominates the philosophy industry.

77
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:48,639
Well, that is pretty devastating and in many ways, right on, I think.

78
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,360
But so, and now, just that was just an introduction to going into the problem of other minds.

79
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:07,120
The problem of the external world doesn't really come up fully until the reality chapter, where he actually has a section on epistemology and the reality of the external world.

80
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:24,080
But now we do get the problem of other minds, and he enters it always as a question, not a problem, and he wants to know what is the way of being of others.

81
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,799
Well, he wants the ontology of being with.

82
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:41,600
And so, on 156, you should all have read this already for the end of last week, but we still haven't done it.

83
00:07:41,720 --> 00:08:01,560
So on 156, he's talking about this, and he's distinguishing, and I just want to tell you, because it's sort of murky, and I didn't notice it for years, there's a big deal being made between the distinction between Daseine with and being with.

84
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:13,160
Dasein with is, I think, an existential factical situation in which there are various Daseins.

85
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,879
And any Dasein is with other Daseins.

86
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,960
That's Dasein with.

87
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:33,480
Being with is an existential structure that every particular Dasein has in its very way of being, and it has it, whether any other particular Daseins are around with it or not.

88
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:40,680
I mean, there may be no Daseins with Robinson Crusoe, but he's still got being with.

89
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:49,399
Partly you can understand that by thinking that he sort of whenever he's, whenever we see, I mean, strange strikes me as interesting and strange.

90
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,879
And I once said it to John Searle, and then he thought it was interesting and strange.

91
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,639
But when we see anything, we always see it as what anybody could see.

92
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,399
The idea that it somehow, in our private experience, just is not the way things look.

93
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,920
They look public.

94
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,200
Merleau-Ponty is on to that.

95
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:23,720
And Heidegger, Dasein with is it doesn't capture that, because that says, well, whenever you see something, you think somebody else is seeing it or could be seeing it.

96
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,399
No, it's more basic than that.

97
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:46,800
It's just that somehow there is this very fundamental ontological characteristic of whatever it is we encounter, unless there's some special, wonderful, peculiar breakdown like after images or something, whatever we encounter, we encounter it as in a public world and for everybody.

98
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:56,399
So he's getting from Dasein with to being with at the bottom of 156 and he he starts out talking about Dasein with.

99
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:14,560
He says in the third line of the bottom paragraph, we use the term Dasein with to designate it that being, and then he got the the four which is wrong there, that being by virtue of which the others who are freed within the others are freed within the world.

100
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:26,560
That just I it's a funny way to put it, but I mean that means that if there if you're around, there have it be and there are other people around, then there's Dasein with between the people around.

101
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:57,840
Thus Dasein, this Dasein with of others is disclosed within the world for a Dasein, and so too for those who are Daseins with us, only because, and now he's switching to the from existential and factical, I think, to existential and a basic structure of Dasein's being, that we only have Dasein with because Dasein is in itself essentially being with.

102
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:04,240
This phenomenological assertion that Dasein is essentially being with has an existential ontological meaning.

103
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:12,000
It doesn't seek to establish ontically, de factically, I am not present at hand alone, and there are others of my kind around.

104
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:23,080
At the bottom of that page, being with is an existential characteristic of Dasein, even when factically no other is present at hand or perceived.

105
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:41,879
And that's just this idea that our experience is just through and through public shareable experience, whether we're the only human being left or we were somehow dropped in here by helicopter with no other human beings around.

106
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,240
We'd still have Dasein with, I think, Huff for Heidegger.

107
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,720
Okay.

108
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,360
And yet, he says, and now you should be careful.

109
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,240
Why is this sentence something troubling?

110
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:11,400
The beginning of that paragraph, which I sort of parachuted into the middle of, the beginning of that paragraph, the expression Dasein, however, shows plainly that in the first instance, this entity is unrelated to others, and that, of course, it can still be with others afterward.

111
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,240
Does that bother you?

112
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,440
And how?

113
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,400
It just says exactly the opposite of what I've been saying for the last five minutes.

114
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,279
Well, that's another one of those rare moments of Heidegger.

115
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:35,640
It's not irony, I think it's like Wittgenstein interlocutor, where the normal Cartesian philosopher comes in and says, but surely, and now let me help with the translation.

116
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:48,519
You wouldn't fall for it if the translator hadn't muffed it, or sorry, because it says, I forget the the German right now, but I wrote in the expression Dasein surely shows plainly.

117
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,680
What's the German?

118
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,159
Oh, sorry, we are, I never told you.

119
00:12:53,159 --> 00:13:01,440
On 120 in the German, in the very first sentence of the second paragraph on 120.

120
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,360
Yoel, the expression Dasein, what?

121
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,800
Surely shows, I think.

122
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,360
What's the German for surely?

123
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
What?

124
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:26,960
Okay.

125
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,840
I would translate that surely.

126
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,279
Not however.

127
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:42,000
I mean, it's supposed to be, it's supposed to give away that the person saying this thing has got some assumption about what's obvious.

128
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,080
I mean, however, could do that too.

129
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,959
But I think it's right in surely, you can feel better what Heidegger is trying to say.

130
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,320
The expression Dasein surely shows plainly, the plainly is the same thing, that in the first instance, Dasein and so forth and so forth.

131
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:08,560
Well, that's wrong, because it goes on, yet one must not fail to notice, and then he goes to Dasein with, and from Dasein with, he goes to being with, and that just takes back that first sentence.

132
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:31,680
And whenever you find a sentence and you're reading along carefully, and it seems to be outrageously wrong-headed, you either have to come and ask me or your TAs what happened, or you have to consider that maybe that it's the stupid interlocutor who's coming in and disagreeing and just getting sort of kicked out of the discussion at that point.

133
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,360
Okay, so Dasein then is, remember, and it's important, Dasein isn't just an organism with limbs that move.

134
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,080
Dasein isn't even a perceiver with visual experiences, as far as Heidegger's concerned.

135
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:54,280
He's not denying that we are organisms with limbs that move, you and me, and that we are perceivers.

136
00:14:54,279 --> 00:15:07,000
But as he puts it sometimes, and I put it sometimes, the Dasein in us isn't an organism with arms and legs, and the Daseine isn't in us, isn't a perceiver with inner visual experiences.

137
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,400
Dasein, well, what is Dasein?

138
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,320
What is the Dasein in us?

139
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:21,080
It's that we take a stand on our own being, and we have to do that, and we have to do that by using the public world.

140
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:27,160
That gets him back to where that's where he wants to be.

141
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,840
There's a paragraph which says that in a kind of mysterious way, but it's interesting.

142
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,240
If you know, I'm trying to not talk much about Kierkegaard.

143
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,399
How many people here have had any Kierkegaard?

144
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,080
Probably people from Philosophy VII.

145
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,720
Okay.

146
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:48,519
Well, he's thinking about Kierkegaard and he's relating his view to Kierkegaard's.

147
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:58,440
And I can't tell whether he's sort of cheating and trying to make himself different from Kierkegaard or he's trying to show that he really got his view of Dasein from Kierkegaard.

148
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:08,920
Because those of you who had Kierkegaard in Philosophy VII know that Kierkegaard defines us, human self, as a being that relates itself to itself, quote unquote.

149
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,759
Sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it?

150
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,960
So, and that's at stake in this paragraph.

151
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:21,639
Heidegger says, But if the self is conceived only as a way of being of this entity, oh, ah, that's the interlocutor again.

152
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:32,079
If the self is conceived only, that's the, as a way of being of this entity, that seems tantamount to volatilizing the real core of Dasein.

153
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,159
Why is that the interlocutor?

154
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,839
Well, an interlocutor says, ah, but the self is a subject, surely.

155
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,319
It's got some kind of self-sufficiency.

156
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:42,240
It's got some kind of content.

157
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:50,000
You're not going to tell me that Dasein is simply a way of acting.

158
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,359
It's a stream of comportment.

159
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,359
So Heidegger has to answer that.

160
00:16:55,359 --> 00:17:17,759
He says, any apprehensiveness, however, which one may have about this gets its nourishing, this meaning that there's no substance there, gets its nourishment from the perverse assumption that the entity in question has at bottom the kind of being which belongs to something present at hand, even if one is far from attributing it to it the solidity of a current corporeal thing.

161
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:24,640
So sometimes people say, in Heidegger's time particularly, well, we certainly aren't making the Cartesian mistake.

162
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,839
We don't think that we are things.

163
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,079
But of course, being a thing doesn't mean having being a physical thing.

164
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,240
It means being a self-sufficient substance.

165
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:48,720
And so when Descartes says that we're race cogitans, or John Searle says we are minds, then they're saying that we are a present-at-hand, self-sufficient something.

166
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:56,960
And then he says, yet, and this is his view, man's substance is not spirit as synthesis of soul and body.

167
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
It is rather existence.

168
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:15,240
Well, remember those from Philosophy VII, when Kierkegaard talks about the self, he says the self is a synthesis of soul and body, and then he says, but then it's not yet a self, because it isn't a self until it takes a stand on itself.

169
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,640
It has to relate itself to itself.

170
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,880
It's not enough just to be a synthesis.

171
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,800
For Plato, the self was a synthesis.

172
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,439
You stuck a soul with a body.

173
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,199
For Descartes, it was a synthesis.

174
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,319
It wasn't even a synthesis.

175
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,639
It was really just a combination for Plato and a combination for Descartes.

176
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:38,119
It's stronger to say it's a synthesis, but it's not strong enough because we don't know what that means.

177
00:18:38,119 --> 00:19:02,200
But what it means is that you can't get rid of either the bodily side or the mind side, but that they are together in something more fundamental, namely the stand that inseparable something or other takes on being that kind of inseparable something or other.

178
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,839
I'm talking in weird abstract terms because if I talk Kierkegaard, I will for a second.

179
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,839
It's the finite and infinite.

180
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:11,079
The self has got finite and infinite.

181
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:13,079
It's got temporal and eternal.

182
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,639
It's got necessity and freedom.

183
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,439
And those are the combination.

184
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,920
And then it has to take a stand on itself.

185
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,000
So Heidegger is what do you think he's doing there?

186
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:29,159
You think he's saying, I'm not making the mistake Kierkegaard made of saying that it's that spirit is a synthesis of soul and body?

187
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:36,119
Or is he saying I'm I agree with Kierkegaard that it's not a synthesis of soul and body, it's more.

188
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:36,599
What?

189
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,279
Oh, didn't I tell us where we were?

190
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,720
I'm sorry, I'm not doing very well.

191
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,759
You've got to remind me of that.

192
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:46,040
Well, I'm on 153 at the end.

193
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah, yeah, no.

194
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,840
Sorry about that.

195
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,639
I had that so but somebody should stop me.

196
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,679
Thanks, Dave.

197
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:59,359
I mean it's it's why I'm, why do you let me go on and on about a paragraph that you can't find because it's not in your reading for the week?

198
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,720
Okay, at the top of 153, it's that top paragraph.

199
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,880
In German, it's 117.

200
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,559
It's the last paragraph of section 25.

201
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:21,439
And I really can't tell, and I don't think anybody can, but the German's not going to help there, I don't think, whether he is making, claiming something on his own or not.

202
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,240
I hope he knows that it's Kierkegaard.

203
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,200
After all, Kierkegaard knew that it was existence.

204
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,480
Kierkegaard said he was the first existential thinker.

205
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:46,399
But anyway, whichever way you want to do it, Heidegger is certainly saying we're not substances, and so we've got to go and look at our way of being, and then the whole problem of other minds is going to disappear.

206
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,240
He's not going to solve the problem of other minds in the external world.

207
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,919
That's this sort of fake activity, or he thinks hopeless activity that's going on.

208
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:10,960
He's going to dissolve the problem of other minds by saying, well, we're not a self-contained substance, and I'm not, and you're not, and I don't have the problem of how I know what's going on inside of your private sort of talk like Wittgenstein, you've got a beetle in a box and you can see it.

209
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:21,359
That's your private experience, and I've got my private experience, and how in the world do I know from anything in my private experience what's going on in yours, or either whether even whether you have any.

210
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,279
You want to say something, David?

211
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,240
What do you think?

212
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,880
I think it's kind of artificial distinction between God and trigger touch.

213
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
So did they expect that it's positive by spirit?

214
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,520
Let's not talk about it now.

215
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,480
I disagree already.

216
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,199
It's not posited by spirit.

217
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,359
The synthesis, never mind.

218
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,480
We'll talk later.

219
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:47,879
Okay.

220
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,599
About the self-passage.

221
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:03,319
So the argument is now, roughly, Heidegger's going to say that being with is an existential structure of Dasein.

222
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,120
And why?

223
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:08,439
Why did I go back to, without telling you to Kappa 153?

224
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:29,879
Because if the way of being of Dasein is existence, and existence, remember, means that its being is an issue for it, and its only way of making its being an issue for it is by what it does, then it follows that it's got this publicness built right into it from the ground up.

225
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:51,000
It needs social roles, like being a teacher, or being a student, or being a father, or whatever, and it needs equipment for doing those roles in order to be what it is, namely existing self, taking a stand on itself.

226
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,519
And now that's got to be in the background of your thinking when we get now to the problem of other minds.

227
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:12,920
In a way, you can see already he's going to just dodge it, dissolve it or something, because he's redefined you, not as a mind, but as what you're just taking a stand on its being.

228
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:22,359
So then he says, so there's no problem about how I know the content, the private content of other minds.

229
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:28,480
And he considers what was a big deal in his day, the proposal that we do it by empathy.

230
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,839
And then he's talking about that on 161 and 162.

231
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:41,679
Empathy is supposed to be how, in my private experience, I can get an intuition of your private experience.

232
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:53,839
I mean, I'm sure sometimes that happens, that somebody's feeling so anxious and upset, and you have empathy, and that means you get a feeling of being anxious and upset.

233
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,519
There are all kinds of problems with that.

234
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,440
How would you know that that was there?

235
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,240
Then you get an epistemological problem.

236
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,839
How do you know that that's the real, that you got the right answer there about what they've got and so forth?

237
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,759
So he's not going to buy the empathy story.

238
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:18,720
And the bottom line is going to be, I don't want to spend the time on empathy, I decided.

239
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:28,319
So the real answer to empathy, the answer to all of these is what I just said, and I think we just spoke of that on 155.

240
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:40,000
I mean, the crucial move is that what I was just saying, Dasein has to be in the world with others to be Dasein.

241
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,279
This is in the middle of 155, 119 in the German.

242
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:49,200
The bottom of that big paragraph.

243
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,959
About six lines from the bottom of that big paragraph on the right.

244
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,560
And not at the beginning of a sentence.

245
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,839
That's why I'm telling you all, as I'm beginning at the end of a sentence, or sort of halfway through.

246
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:12,599
Even one's own Dasein becomes something that it can itself approximately come across only when it looks away from experiences.

247
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,519
Which word for experiences is that?

248
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,799
You remember?

249
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,159
That's Erlabnas.

250
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,599
That's the private experiences word.

251
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,560
And this is, he's just giving you again disagreeing with all of the Cartesians.

252
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,919
Only when it looks away from its inner experiences and the center of its acts.

253
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:37,720
Cross out actions, because actions are public bodily things and acts are private mental things.

254
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,720
It's a crucial distinction for Husserl, for instance, that this translator just doesn't seem to know about.

255
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:58,359
So he says, so even one's own Dasein becomes something that it can proximally come across only when it looks away from experiences and the center of its acts or does not yet see them at all.

256
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,920
That is, what you find on reflection is inner.

257
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,080
I mean, that's what, you know, I talked last time.

258
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:14,039
Augustine saw Jerome reading this book and getting inner meaning out of the book directly into his mind.

259
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,399
You can do that.

260
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,480
But Dasein isn't essentially reflection.

261
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,880
Dasein is essentially absorbed in dealing and coping, whatever.

262
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,959
So he says, Dasein finds itself proximally in what it does.

263
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,319
This is a crucial sentence.

264
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:41,960
Dasein finds itself proximally in what it does, uses, expects, avoids, in those things environmentally ready to hand with which it is concerned.

265
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:48,039
And that's so it's, I think that's important for two reasons.

266
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:55,079
One, there are readers of Heidegger, and there was like a TA that I fought with over this for about the last four years.

267
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,519
He's now gone on to be a big, big success as a business consultant.

268
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,319
I don't know what that shows, except that you can do all sorts of things as a philosopher.

269
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,319
But he kept saying, well, Heidegger doesn't believe in inner experiences at all.

270
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,640
And I thought, no, I hope not.

271
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:23,120
I mean, I don't think he should just rule out everything that people have made a great effort to find out that you can cry inwardly like Odysseus and so forth.

272
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
But I think that's a nice quote.

273
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,559
I take it there are, quote, experiences, some private stuff.

274
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:40,240
And they might even be sort of what you perform when you act consciously, reflectively.

275
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,759
There may be you as an ego doing the acting.

276
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:52,639
But all of that is not where you basically are and what you're doing when you're doing your Daseining.

277
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,000
Then you are absorbed in your dealing and coping and taking a stand through it.

278
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,119
That's what it says.

279
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,439
That Dasein finds itself proximally, that is, right off.

280
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,000
Sometimes he says proximally and for the most part.

281
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,039
That means at first and normally or most of the time.

282
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:19,359
So Dasein finds itself at first and most of the time absorbed in what it's doing in the environmental stuff.

283
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,559
That's his answer to the idea that you need empathy.

284
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,680
You don't need empathy to find out what somebody's doing.

285
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,720
You just need to watch them, watch their compartment to find out what they're doing.

286
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:44,120
And so, and that's so you can just look at somebody and you can see what they're up to.

287
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,720
A little more of that in the next paragraph, skipping three lines.

288
00:28:49,720 --> 00:29:06,680
We have already intimated that this I here, which we can say, does not mean a certain privilege point, that an I thing, but is to be understood as being in in terms of the yonder, of the world it is ready to hand, the yonder which is the dwelling place of Dasein's concern.

289
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,159
So these are very many ways of saying that over and over, Dasein is what it does.

290
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:23,960
Oddly enough, I thought I wrote in here, maybe you'll come across it later, one more interesting place where he says that.

291
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:28,519
Well, he says it clear enough there, so I'm not going to go look for it.

292
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:34,119
So if that's true, the problem of other minds just disappears.

293
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:39,480
But, and now comes one more move that I think doesn't, yeah, Tyler.

294
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,439
$15 is a limit is more as you can imagine.

295
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,679
$15 than that is all other minds.

296
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,359
I suppose.

297
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:01,960
I mean, we get to this very tricky question that Wittgenstein is so concerned with, because pain is a very interesting one.

298
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,519
Could I be feeling pain and not acting in any way as if I'm in pain?

299
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,039
Then how do you get access to the fact that I'm in pain?

300
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:18,200
And so Wittgenstein goes out of his way to try to say that pain is necessarily connected with pain behavior.

301
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,839
And then you see people and you see whether they're in pain.

302
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,160
I don't think Heidegger has a view about that.

303
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:33,040
I think Heidegger just wants to say whatever it is that you do have inner direct access to, it's not important as to about who you are.

304
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:40,559
It may be very important if you're in pain, if you don't want to be in pain, and you've got to try to get out of it somehow.

305
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:48,000
But that's and of course as soon as you start sort of scrambling around to get out of it, it's pretty obvious what your problem is.

306
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,960
But the point is who you are is going not going to be understandable in terms of this residue.

307
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
I think Tyler said something like that.

308
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:06,639
This inner stuff, which you got to understand is going to be sort of, in Heidegger language, primitive.

309
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,880
It's something that's left when you take away almost everything that's important to what it is to be Dasein.

310
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,440
There's a little bit of private stuff there that you can get by introspection.

311
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,720
That's why I told you the story about Odyssey and about Augustine and about after images and stuff.

312
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,079
It's a hard thing to find much evidence for it.

313
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:37,200
And when you compare it to the amazing amount of hammering and walking and looking and talking and stuff that we do in the public world like our compartment, it looks tiny.

314
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,960
But that's all right.

315
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,160
So far, I think Heidegger thinks that's fine.

316
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,120
And maybe, and I think Tyler's right, there's a problem about how you ever get to know it.

317
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,519
And that's exactly what I was going to talk about next.

318
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,240
Ye yeah, but before I do, uh, questions.

319
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,640
Yeah.

320
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:01,759
Yeah?

321
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:21,319
If you get quite simple about how principal is trade in certain states in their world, which they have certain personal objects in the last 1006, then how just by looking at, say, some of the different interpretations, how can I know what their interpretation goes?

322
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,240
Well, yeah, yeah.

323
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,799
Okay.

324
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,240
That's a good question.

325
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,879
I don't know quite what to say in a short way.

326
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,960
This is a serious problem.

327
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,199
Heidegger's student, Hans K.

328
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:44,359
L.

329
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,799
Gottemer, thought a lot this talked a lot about this problem.

330
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:55,000
How, coming out of one culture with its world and its style, you could understand another culture with its world.

331
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,399
And he has this notion of the fusion of horizons, which he makes a lot about.

332
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,039
Charles Taylor then takes up and makes a lot about.

333
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,320
It's not easy.

334
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,880
Anthropologists learn to do it.

335
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,359
One thing you'd have to do is go native.

336
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:08,920
You can't.

337
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,480
This is the most sort of Heideggerian thing to say.

338
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:20,280
It's not a belief system the other person's got, which if you could figure out and write down all the things they believe, you'd then understand their world.

339
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,879
It's much more basic than that.

340
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,960
It's ways of acting and seeing and sanding and moving and so forth.

341
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,599
But it's just a fact that you can learn it.

342
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:39,320
The anthropologists, if you live with the people long enough, you can see the ghosts that they see and so forth.

343
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,879
And so it's okay.

344
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:52,759
I mean, on this view, it just means that it's not in a sort of philosophical, epistemological problem that this is utterly private to that culture and you've got yours private.

345
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,840
The whole thing just gets scaled up.

346
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,880
It's something that they're doing, and it's something that you could gradually learn to do.

347
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:02,719
Okay, yeah.

348
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,399
There is.

349
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,119
Oh, I see.

350
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,799
I thought you were going to say the opposite, and I was already getting an answer to that question.

351
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,439
I thought you were going to say, but let's answer what you didn't say, because somebody might.

352
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,600
I mean, isn't it important that as we cope, we got this inner sense of what's going on?

353
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:43,199
But you were smart enough not to say that, because I spent a lot of trouble talking about people in flow and Heidegger.

354
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:52,400
I couldn't open to it, but there's a place in Division II where he says we have to lose ourselves in order to become able to deal and cope most successfully.

355
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,359
So that's fine.

356
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,080
But isn't there a skill in introspecting?

357
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm sure there is.

358
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:17,120
But it doesn't, it's not a problem, I think, for him, because it's not what you find when you would only be a problem if what you found when you introspected with skill was your true self, which is a kind of romantic view, but it could also be a kind of psychoanalytical view.

359
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:34,880
As soon as you think that, you need help, from a Heideggerian point of view, anyway, to get over the idea that there is this deep true self, that if you were subtle enough and smart enough and work hard enough at it, you'd be able to uh learn about it.

360
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:37,280
Uh okay, next.

361
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,839
Yeah.

362
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,440
How do you defend problems?

363
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,400
You great.

364
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,279
Terrific.

365
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,880
You and and and and who else?

366
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,639
I guess Tyler maybe, are doing the next move I wanted to make.

367
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:56,680
I love it when you can s see ahead like that.

368
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,039
I was going to say, but there is, after all, some sort of problem of other minds.

369
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:11,719
And if you're going to take this view that you're going to sort of get rid of the problem of other minds, you better explain sort of to what extent there is such a problem.

370
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:16,840
And or another way to put it is, why does anybody ever thought that such a problem existed?

371
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,279
That's sort of what you're asking.

372
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:28,039
Isn't there a sense in which people are alienated and withdrawn from each other and don't know what each other is thinking?

373
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:30,359
Or am I reading stuff into your question?

374
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,719
Why don't we just draw on how you bring the being withdrawn?

375
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:45,159
Heidegger talks about, wait a minute, let's get withdrawn sort of clear.

376
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:54,839
When Heidegger talks about how the hammer must withdraw in order for me to hammer successfully, he means it's got to become what I call transparent or invisible.

377
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,960
That's different.

378
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:09,400
I thought you were going to talk about people who are sort of secretive and whom who you feel what they're doing and what they're thinking isn't really in sync and that they're hiding from you their real motives and their real feelings.

379
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:21,639
That would be the real problem of other minds, not as a general problem about how any human being ever understands the private stuff going on inside of any other human being.

380
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,400
That's a fake problem.

381
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:34,799
But that particular human being can have particular problems with understanding some of the private secret memories, motivations, and stuff of some other people.

382
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,279
Heidegger, I think, doesn't want to deny it.

383
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,959
In fact, I'll show you where he says it.

384
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:55,519
And I think it's interesting because I think if you're going to go around dissolving philosophical problems, you'd better also make a space for whatever that philosophical problem was sort of trying to get at and admit that there really is an issue there.

385
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:06,720
It's just not the kind of problem you see that grows out of a philosophical assumption, namely that the self is a self-contained private stream of experiences.

386
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,400
That's hopeless.

387
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,399
And that's Heidegger just wants to get rid of it.

388
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,519
But now, let's turn to the part where, I don't know if it's going to help or not, but then you can say something again.

389
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:24,640
I mean, what he talks literally about being withdrawn, that people can be withdrawn from each other, and then you see what that would be.

390
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,159
You've got to see the picture.

391
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:40,240
There's going to be a breakdown case in which you can see what when the normal public interaction of people, what I like in Merleau-Ponty, but Heidegger can't call it, say, just intercorporeality.

392
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:49,359
My body just picks up on your body lots of what our shared situation is without having it going through my mind or your mind at all.

393
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:57,519
Merleau-Ponty says that, and now in neuroscience, they're discovering something called mirror neurons, which sort of explain how we do it.

394
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,839
But Heidegger doesn't go that way.

395
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,519
Heidegger just says, well, mostly you're taking a stand on your being.

396
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,119
You've got to do that publicly.

397
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,640
Everybody can see it.

398
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,279
But sometimes there are breakdown cases.

399
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,120
And this is on 161.

400
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,760
On German 124, right at the top.

401
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,240
Knowing is grounded in being with, which understands primordially.

402
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:42,600
It operates proximately in accordance with the kind of being which is closest to us, being in the world, being with, and does so by acquaintance with that which Dasein, along with others, comes across in its environment, circumspect environmental circumspection and concerns itself with and so forth.

403
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,920
So far that's the thing we've been saying.

404
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:53,800
And a little further, solicitous concern is understood in terms of what we are concerned with and along with our understanding of it and so forth.

405
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,519
And along with concernful solicitude, the other is proximally disclosed.

406
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:00,120
That's just a summing up.

407
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,519
Now comes the breakdown case.

408
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:15,480
That because solicitude dwells proximally and for the most part in the deficient or at least indifferent modes, in indifferent or passing one another, proximally and for the most part.

409
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,159
Hmm.

410
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,039
That's a funny thing to say.

411
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,280
I can't defend him there.

412
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,640
I mean, he's going to go on and say, boy, people are really awfully alienated from each other most of the time.

413
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:36,359
That's sort of a, I think, a German 1920s existentialist kind of neurosis.

414
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:49,319
But I think that he he's right that any time, anywhere, somebody can be isolated from somebody else on a background of shared stuff that they're not isolated on.

415
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,199
That's one way to see it.

416
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,480
I mean, if they were totally isolated, we've got to mainstreames for that.

417
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:01,920
They would be a schizophrenic having a schizophrenic breakdown in which they really were, as we say, out of touch with everybody in the world.

418
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,639
But he's got this funny view, but let's go on.

419
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,320
I never noticed it before.

420
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:12,080
Because solicitude dwells proximally for the most solicitude is his name for caring about people.

421
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,440
Where does he define it?

422
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,319
You should know.

423
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,519
We should look at it.

424
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,879
Have we defined it already?

425
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,600
Yes.

426
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,640
The bottom of 158.

427
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,200
There's lots of different kinds of solicitude.

428
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,039
And even we've got to go further.

429
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:29,760
It's defined at the bottom of 157.

430
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:37,200
So Dasein's, I'll just tell you this, mode of relating to things is care.

431
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,120
And care comes in two flavors, modes.

432
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,519
You can be caring about things, and that's concern.

433
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,080
Care is Zorga in German.

434
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,800
Concern is the Zorgen.

435
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,360
Or care can be caring about people.

436
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,440
And then it's Firzorge.

437
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,480
And that gets translated solicitude.

438
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,440
And then he has stuff to say about that.

439
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,399
It doesn't have much to do with what we have to worry about here.

440
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,479
So we are not talking about it.

441
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,400
I mean, these are possible paper topics lurking all over the place.

442
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,480
Now, where was I just reading?

443
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,800
Oh, here we are, on 161.

444
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,799
Okay, now, solicitude, that is the way we care about people, can go wrong.

445
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,200
And he thinks it goes wrong most of the time.

446
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:34,879
Heidegger was not a very socially adept person, and he didn't have much sense of ethics either or how to treat other people.

447
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,480
I mean, I think he's just telling you his own kind of problem.

448
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,839
But anyway, here we go.

449
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:54,679
But because solicitude dwells proximally and for the most part in the deficient, or at least the indifferent modes, in the indifference of passing one another by, the kind of knowing oneself which is essential and closest demands that one become acquainted with oneself.

450
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,519
That isn't, maybe that's somebody else talking, the interlocutor.

451
00:42:58,519 --> 00:42:59,559
I wish it were.

452
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:00,519
Let's go on.

453
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:15,640
And when, indeed, one's knowing oneself gets lost in such ways of aloofness, hiding oneself away or putting on a disguise, being with one another must follow special routes of its own in order to come close to others and even to see through them and so forth.

454
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:17,960
Well, gee, half understanding.

455
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,599
I tell you what I was going to say, and then I'll try to see if I can say anything more.

456
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:29,239
I'm just going to say there are private modes in which people have hidden motives and so forth.

457
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:50,440
They're hiding themselves, they're disguising themselves, they're withdrawing from their normal, everyday human relations, and then you've got a problem of specific other mind, you've got a problem of another mind, and you better try to figure out what they're up to, because it could be dangerous for them or dangerous for you.

458
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,800
That's all fine.

459
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,640
That's a deficient mode.

460
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:56,039
That's sort of a breakdown case.

461
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:00,919
It's like what happens when the hammer is missing.

462
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:14,519
The normal activity doesn't work anymore, and you have to deliberate and think about what to do, and either look for a hammer or find another hammer or get a better theory of hammers and so forth.

463
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:17,880
So there can be breakdown relations with people.

464
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,359
Now, how to understand that first sentence?

465
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,600
I'm going to go read it again.

466
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:33,679
But because solicitude dwells proximally and for the most part, that means at first and most of the time, in the deficient or indifferent modes, I can see the indifferent mode even.

467
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:50,480
I mean, yeah, sure, most of the time we are sort of utterly not involved with or concerned with what stand, I'm not concerned or involved with what stand the people in the in Barn are taking, all of those people in that in that subway car.

468
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,759
I couldn't care less.

469
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,080
I'm busy reading what I'm reading, and I got my own stand to take and do.

470
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:02,400
So, and that would be all right, that if people are mostly related to each other in an indifferent mode, but it wouldn't be a problem yet.

471
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,640
It would just be you hadn't, you didn't care, but you could find out if you did care.

472
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:12,720
The problem is when people are actually trying to fool you, disguising their motives and so forth, you see.

473
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,039
But now I want to say, but that's not your normal situation.

474
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:18,719
So, maybe we can sort it out.

475
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:28,479
So, I want to say proximally, for the most part, you're in an indifferent mode, and therefore you are neither getting it or not getting it as to what the other person's stand on their being is.

476
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,399
The kind of knowing oneself, which is essential and closest, demands that one become acquainted with oneself.

477
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:36,479
What does that mean?

478
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,079
Anybody know?

479
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,519
I mean, you ought to be acquainted with yourself.

480
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,680
How should you become acquainted with yourself?

481
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:47,200
By doing something.

482
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:54,719
I mean, I become acquainted with myself by teaching or going home and being a father or whatever.

483
00:45:54,719 --> 00:46:04,160
And everybody, you don't, in Heidegger world, you don't go around sort of having deep introspective studies of what your inner state really is.

484
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:09,519
Is this infatuation, or is this really love, or is this jealousy, and so forth?

485
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:16,599
That's one way to be, but that's not Heidegger's view of normal Dasein.

486
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:18,919
Okay, I don't know about that sentence.

487
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,920
I don't know what to make of it.

488
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,279
Anyway, I know what he should say, and that's all we need.

489
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:44,279
He should say that, yes, there can be a kind of breakdown of normal being with and its ability to get us in touch with Dasein, other Daseins, in a way that is connected with what they're up to, and that's Dasein with.

490
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,280
And that's the basic mode.

491
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,360
And sometimes it can break down.

492
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,759
And of course, you have to stay always with Heidegger.

493
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,519
And you can understand the breakdown as a deficient version of the basic mode.

494
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:07,000
But you can't be a romantic starting with this introspection, finding out what your really deep feelings are, your really deep self, and then go to the public world.

495
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:22,519
He thinks that's, you can't take sort of this inner residue and produce the whole shared public phenomenon, but you can take the public phenomena, leave out a lot, and then you'll understand what this inner residue is, namely inner residue.

496
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:24,200
Now I saw a hand somewhere.

497
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:25,080
Yeah.

498
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,280
Would what?

499
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,319
Indebtedness?

500
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,439
Is that what you see?

501
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:37,159
It's authentic.

502
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:39,719
I mean, well, we didn't talk about authentic, inauthentic.

503
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:41,960
That's a whole other story.

504
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:48,919
That is, how can I tell you without making you read Division II instantly on the spot?

505
00:47:49,559 --> 00:48:10,400
There is you can see whether somebody's authentic or not in their behavior in Heidegger by the fact that authentic people respond to the unique situation, he'll say later.

506
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:19,200
That is, they just don't do what any old person does in a vain sort of standard way, responding to what they take to be the standard situation.

507
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,240
They respond in their own unique way to what they perceive as the unique situation.

508
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:26,160
And that's another story.

509
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,000
And then you can recognize them and what they're doing.

510
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,280
Or at least the people who are good at that can recognize other people who are good at it.

511
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,720
It's all, how many come across in 25A, Pharnesis and Aristotle?

512
00:48:40,719 --> 00:49:02,160
Heidegger gets this from long studies and many hours of lectures on what's kind of pharnasis, which is translated practical wisdom of what people have who are really authentic and who do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

513
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,079
But we're going to put that aside.

514
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,640
That's a Division II question.

515
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:07,200
Yeah.

516
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:27,360
We're talking about now this business of e-baba.

517
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,800
I just want to see where we are again.

518
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,000
We're going to become acquainted with ourselves.

519
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,120
Yeah.

520
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,799
I couldn't hear you, sir.

521
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,160
Talk louder.

522
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:45,880
We make the acquaintance of other people, not only.

523
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,519
Now, what sentence are we at?

524
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,840
Because that would be great.

525
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:54,440
If that meant find the make the acquaintance of other people too.

526
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,759
I've lost the sentence I'm trying to explain.

527
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,039
Where are we?

528
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,319
Oh, yeah, okay, but because solitude, so forth.

529
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,680
And now then he says, and closer demands that one become acquainted with oneself.

530
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,400
What is now, and you say, means what?

531
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,279
Okay, so you would become acquainted with yourself.

532
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,000
I like it.

533
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:30,039
Here's how I'm going to get out of it until I get a chance to think more about it.

534
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:32,280
How would you become acquainted with yourself?

535
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,120
Well, you've got two pictures.

536
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:45,960
You go and you close yourself off and you introspect and you meditate and you try to get an understanding of what you're really feeling and what you really want and all that.

537
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,799
That's not what Heidegger thinks.

538
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:54,920
Heidegger, by the way, was not happy with the whole idea of therapy, although he was in therapy at some point for a while.

539
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:17,079
But the idea that you're going to find out about yourself that way, as opposed to finding out yourself by observing what you're doing, what you care about, what you're willing, how much of my time with my family, I'm ready to give up because I've got to talk to students and vice versa.

540
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:24,039
You find out lots about yourself, and you're understanding of what it is to be you.

541
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,639
And I think that would be all right.

542
00:51:25,639 --> 00:51:26,719
That would be helpful.

543
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,919
That you have to be acquainted with yourself, just like you have to be acquainted with your neighbors.

544
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:37,439
And it's not by introspection, but by being watching what you're doing, so to speak.

545
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,800
That would be nice.

546
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:40,559
Is that what you're saying?

547
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,039
One self isn't being made.

548
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,759
But then I don't understand what that, it's got to have some, you've got to be acquainted with something.

549
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,320
So, anyway, I'm making.

550
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,519
Well, that's interesting.

551
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:03,200
Okay, well, that's good.

552
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:05,199
That's nice that it's not in there.

553
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:07,039
I don't know what to do about it.

554
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,599
But, okay, not is it at the bottom of the page?

555
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,039
I haven't had the time to go down and look.

556
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,199
I see, wait, okay, let me just look at it.

557
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,639
The distinct from the self, their quantum knowledge of the self, which will be discussed.

558
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:22,639
Hmm, I will go back and look at all that.

559
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:24,240
Yeah.

560
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:27,119
With what?

561
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:30,080
I see.

562
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:31,519
Okay.

563
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,319
Well, let's.

564
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,880
We had a lot.

565
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:42,080
I think this was a happy detour because it's important always to know sort of what the other, the enemy view is.

566
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,240
And it's better not be this deep kind of introspection.

567
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,120
I can't resist telling you a story that illustrates this.

568
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:55,839
I was having lunch at the faculty club with Charles Taylor and with Michelle Foucault.

569
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,280
And they couldn't be more different, although they're very smart people.

570
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:14,760
And Charles Taylor, who's always interested in introspection and articulating your deepest desires, was talking about how important it was to articulate and think about whether when you were involved with some person infatuation or was it really love?

571
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:22,360
And Foucault got more and more worried and puzzled and that, and he finally said, What difference does it make as long as you're enjoying yourself?

572
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,640
And I mean, those are the two points of view, really.

573
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:30,919
I mean, and Heidegger, I think, is on the enjoying yourself side of it.

574
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:37,239
You'll find out soon enough, and you can't find out anywhere by a short circuit of self-contemplation anyway.

575
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:38,039
Yeah.

576
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,159
It's uniquely mine.

577
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:51,559
Oh, well, what I make of it, it had nothing to do with introspection.

578
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:54,760
It's got to do with your style.

579
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,920
I mean, yes, that's funny that you should.

580
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,319
How many have seen Across the Universe by any chance?

581
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,200
It's around.

582
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,679
It has a very Heideggerian moment in them.

583
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:07,879
I was thinking that I was going to begin the lecture with this, and then I decided not enough people will have seen it.

584
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,519
But let me state it first in Heideggerian.

585
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:21,319
I mean, I got into long arguments with my TAs over the years about when you're behaving authentically, you've got this mind-ness.

586
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,879
It isn't enough, they were telling me, to say being a teacher.

587
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,159
Being a teacher is such a, it's a role, it's too general.

588
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:31,079
Everybody, lots of people are teachers.

589
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,400
That can't be my stand on my being.

590
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,960
My stand on my being, my other TA, I had these two TAs, Rick Tonedo and Forrest Hartman.

591
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,320
Rick was saying, you're too general.

592
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:47,320
And Forrest was saying, the right answer is that I take a stand on what it is to be me.

593
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,159
And Burt Dreyfus, and there's nothing more general you can say.

594
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:55,480
You have your own unique, just being you.

595
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:04,080
And then after much struggle, I finally came to the view: I think it's that I'm a teacher in my own unique way.

596
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,599
But it has a mixture.

597
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,680
You have to have the role of teacher.

598
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,920
You can't just go and be unique.

599
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:16,000
And I could just be rolling around on the ground or outside or something and be very unique.

600
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:25,840
And you've got to do it, but you can't just do, take, you can't just be, I can't just be Bert Dreyfus, and I can't just be a teacher.

601
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:32,960
It came up when you see Across the Universe, which is a pretty good movie, there's a place at a dinner they're having a strange discussion.

602
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,400
And the father says to the son, why don't you do something?

603
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,279
Why don't you get a job?

604
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,319
Why don't you go to work or whatever?

605
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,280
Do something.

606
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:53,519
And somebody else, and the son says, you've got to be something in order to do something.

607
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,960
And then the Heideggerian says, how does he say it?

608
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:09,120
You've got to do something.

609
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,240
I'll tell you next time.

610
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:20,880
I can't remember exactly the phrase, but the phrase was in effect: you've got to be able to do the thing in your own way.

611
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,200
And he was putting the two together.

612
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:26,159
And that stopped the conversation at the dinner, I remember.

613
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:29,279
But luckily, I was with five other people.

614
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,440
Somebody will be able to remember.

615
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,599
Okay, well, we've got to go on.

616
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,720
We're ready to go to the other half of the lecture.

617
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:44,920
I just want to see one more sentence, which I think is important.

618
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,720
Maybe not.

619
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,079
Well, I'll just sum up the thing.

620
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:59,079
Empathy comes back in, because Heidegger says, yeah, there's empathy, but it's only in these breakdown cases.

621
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:05,480
At the bottom of 162, German 125, he says, empathy does not first constitute being with.

622
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,080
Only in the basis of being with does empathy become possible.

623
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:14,760
It gets its motivation from the unsociability of the dominant modes of being with.

624
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,599
That last thing is a bit too bad way of thinking.

625
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:24,680
But he's saying, in effect, this general point, empathy is what you do when there's a breakdown.

626
00:57:25,239 --> 00:57:28,119
It gets its necessity that you need to do it.

627
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:31,160
And it gets because there can be breakdowns.

628
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,960
And then you have to.

629
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,719
But still, you have to rely on a kind of being with even to have empathy.

630
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:41,320
That's his conclusion.

631
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:41,960
Okay.

632
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:44,920
That was all fascinating, but we've got to run on.

633
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:53,320
Now, from now on, we're finally ready to take up the tantalizing question that I left you with last time.

634
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,759
So, and it's the final nail in the coffin for the ego and for the subject, I think.

635
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,079
And it's very original, Heidegger.

636
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,360
And the question I was asking is, well, what's the source of the meaning in them?

637
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:10,759
In Descartes, it's us putting values on things.

638
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,080
In Searle, it's still us putting values, function predicates on things.

639
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,479
In Kant, it's the transcendental ego giving meaning to everything.

640
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,960
In Husserl, it's the individual transcendental ego that gives the meaning to everything.

641
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:31,280
Heidegger, you've got an entirely different take on where the intelligibility of everything comes from.

642
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:38,400
And having read it now, does anybody think they know the answer to that puzzle question?

643
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,319
It's very surprising and radical.

644
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,760
Well, we have to find out.

645
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,920
Okay, so here we go.

646
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,239
We're going to talk about now at the bottom of 163, section 27.

647
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:58,000
Every day being oneself and the one cross out the they.

648
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,039
The first thing we have to do is fix the translation.

649
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:08,240
It's one of those moments where the translation goes directly against the phenomenon.

650
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:29,680
The dasman, the German, dash is this the man is, now I have to tell you, it's not man, it means in English, that's why I translate it the way I do in my commentary, it has to be translated the one.

651
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,120
Some people say the anyone, I think Polt does.

652
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,119
He got that from me at an earlier stage.

653
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,799
I believe that we should say the anyone.

654
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,240
I don't think that's good enough.

655
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:45,679
Some people say the one with a capital O, that's a bad move, because in German it's got a capital M, but again, all nouns have capital M's.

656
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:48,880
That sounds like some godlike thing.

657
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,319
So what is Das Mann?

658
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,399
What does it mean to say the one?

659
00:59:52,400 --> 01:00:03,360
Well, it comes in German and in English when we say one pays their income tax, or one eats their peas with a fork, or whatever.

660
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,240
It's the general statement of how one behaves.

661
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:10,960
I can't even say it without it in there in the culture.

662
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,039
So one sits on chairs, and one generally doesn't stand on chairs.

663
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,759
It's the norms.

664
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:23,080
The one is the phrase that expresses what the norms are.

665
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:29,559
Now, and the important thing is, it isn't just that they eat their peas with a fork or they pay their income tax.

666
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,400
It's got to cover me too.

667
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,080
That's the crucial thing.

668
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:34,759
I'm part of the one.

669
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:40,919
The whole point of this chapter is that I am the one.

670
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:45,239
The chapter starts by asking, who is Dasein?

671
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:49,160
You can ask yourself two questions if you read it.

672
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:56,039
It's answering both at once, and in a completely original way that no other philosopher I know of has even gone into.

673
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:02,039
It's an amazing chapter because it's clear, it's straightforward.

674
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:13,320
The phenomena is right there, as Heidegger says in the History of Concept of Time, in your face, and yet nobody has noticed it because it's very, quote, sly, Heidegger says.

675
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:19,080
And once you see it, you see that, of course, it's extremely interesting and important.

676
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:25,160
So the question you want to ask yourself is sort of what the caterpillar asked Alice in Wonderland, who are you?

677
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:27,640
You want to ask yourself, who am I?

678
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:30,839
That is the who of Dasein.

679
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:33,559
It sounds, and you might think, well, who am I?

680
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:34,759
Well, I'm Bert Dreyfus.

681
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,759
I've got my own style and my own family and all that.

682
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,159
Heidegger says, no, that's not who you are, unless you're authentic.

683
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:47,639
But we're talking about normal people now and who they are.

684
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:54,840
So you want to know the who of Dasein and you want to know the source of all the intelligibility in the world.

685
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,839
Heidegger's going to answer both of them by saying it's the one.

686
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:03,440
Now, how am I going to convince you of that?

687
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,559
Well, it'll take a while.

688
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,800
But first, let's just fix the translation.

689
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,440
Whenever you see the they, you've got to say the one.

690
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:15,039
And even the translators on 164 have to contradict themselves.

691
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:25,039
When he talks about in the first full paragraph on 164, about the middle of 126.

692
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,480
I'm trying to skip into the sentence somewhere.

693
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:46,239
Being is not, my being or its being, I'm in the first full paragraph, third line.

694
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:49,440
Its being, that is, Dasein's being, has been taken away by the others.

695
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,720
Dasein's everyday possibilities of being are for the others to dispose of as they please.

696
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,839
These others, moreover, that would be the they.

697
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,199
So he's got to get, he's got to, but this is Heidegger moving you into it.

698
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:03,679
Those others, moreover, are not definite others.

699
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,160
On the contrary, any other can represent them.

700
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:09,120
And there you get sort of the anyone, but it's not right yet.

701
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:19,120
What is decisive is just that inconspicuous domination by others, which has already been taken over unawares from Dasein as being with.

702
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,679
One belongs to the others, oneself, and enhances their power.

703
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:32,719
You can't say one belongs to the they oneself, because the whole point is it's not me and them.

704
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:44,200
He gets clearer where it says 127 in the margin, when he wants to say that we are all taken over by this norm, this one.

705
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:53,639
We take pleasure and enjoy ourselves now, which he says they, the translator, he notices that we shouldn't say they, he puts mon in quotes.

706
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:58,599
What we have to say, he quotes, is we take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as one takes pleasure.

707
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:03,400
We read, see, and judge about literature and act as one sees and judges.

708
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,559
Likewise, we shrink back from the great mass as one shrinks back, and we find shocking what one finds shocking.

709
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:20,360
The one which is nothing definite, which we all are, see, we can't all be the they, which we all are, though not as a sum, prescribes the kind of being of everydayness.

710
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,840
So what's it all about?

711
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:45,160
Well, the phenomena is that all of our activity is permeated by norms, is done because it's the normal thing to do, that we've grown up and it's part of this familiarity that we've taken over, that we got these norms and all over the place we are conforming to these norms.

712
01:04:45,159 --> 01:05:01,720
The phenomena, and this is the thing to keep in mind, the phenomena is the fact that, and the importance of the fact that, that we all conform to norms all the time, even though most of the time we don't even notice it or realize it, so forth.

713
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:07,159
Now, to understand this, you've got to have in mind the kind of norm he's talking about.

714
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:23,640
If you just stay on the level of Dasman, you can make clever remarks and even maybe sort of social observations, but you can't understand what Heidegger's talking about, because he's talking about an invisible phenomenon, which is already sort of contradictory.

715
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:28,960
Well, I'll give you an example, two examples of invisible phenomena that people would study.

716
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:33,039
When you have this distance standing, I think I talked about it already, haven't I?

717
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:44,639
Ever, I mean, we all stand a certain distance from each other when we're with friends, with intimates, with strangers, and with authorities, and we do it under different conditions and so forth.

718
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:52,800
We've got this whole understanding of what distance one stands under all sorts of conditions.

719
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:58,880
And we got it in this sly way, namely, it took us over.

720
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,640
And our parents taught it to us, but they didn't even know they had it.

721
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:11,360
They just felt it got closer to us if we were too far away and farther from us under if we were too near under a whole variety of circumstances.

722
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:28,240
And our amazing ability to acquire skills without even knowing that we're acquiring them, we acquired this great, nuanced, subtle, complicated skill of standing the right distance, standing the distance that one stands in that sort of situation.

723
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,359
But of course, this is all over the place.

724
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:38,320
We eat the way one eats, and we walk the way one walks, and we sit the way one sits, and it just permeates our culture.

725
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,880
The next question really is: and why is that important?

726
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,159
What think to ask yourself?

727
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,719
How, I was going to give you another example of what one does, which struck me the other day.

728
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:56,559
I was reading some kind of linguist who listens carefully to what we say.

729
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,719
I'll tell you something which will transform your way of listening to telephone conversations.

730
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,960
For the rest of your life, you'll never be able to forget it.

731
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,359
Maybe you realize it already.

732
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:05,199
Probably not.

733
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:10,960
When you want to get somebody off the other end of a telephone conversation, you always say okay.

734
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,519
And after you've said, okay three times, they go away.

735
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,679
It's just an amazing phenomenon.

736
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,559
Just listen to yourself and everybody else.

737
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,559
Where you got it, I don't know.

738
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,679
We all got it.

739
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:31,719
One says okay when one is finished with the conversation, and one realizes at the other end that one is finished with the conversation, and that's it.

740
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,079
Sometimes people are stubborn.

741
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:36,759
You have to say okay four or five times to get them off the phone.

742
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,719
But in any case, the world is just full of stuff like that.

743
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,279
But and why is it important?

744
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:43,800
Well, what if people didn't?

745
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:45,960
Well, no, I needed to say one more thing.

746
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,439
What's the name for this phenomenon, besides this brilliant name, the one?

747
01:07:50,439 --> 01:07:53,079
Well, we're talking about conforming.

748
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:56,119
You've got to conform to the norms of the culture.

749
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:58,920
That's the boring way to put it.

750
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:03,079
And then, and you've got to, and why do you have to?

751
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,519
Well, partly you have to because they force you to.

752
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:23,079
If you deviate, they will either coerce you back into the norm, or they will co-opt you back, or they will all join you, and everybody will have long hair, like across the universe, which is in the 60s.

753
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,439
And then one had long hair.

754
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:30,920
And then there was a time when one had short hair before that.

755
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:40,439
Anyway, you will either take, you know, everybody will start doing it if you do it and it's off on its own, or they will put you back into doing it.

756
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:43,479
Another place where it's clear is in pronunciation.

757
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:53,880
If you mispronounce somebody's name or just some word in English, people won't usually just tell you, you know, they won't say you mispronounced it, you ought to say it so-and-so.

758
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:01,759
They will use the word in the next sentence or so with a sort of emphasis on it, and you will pick up it and you will start saying it right.

759
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:04,159
Or and if you don't, they'll just have to do that a few more times.

760
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,719
And they may not even realize they're doing it.

761
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:11,920
But it's important what would happen if we didn't all conform to talking the same way.

762
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:15,359
When it got serious, we couldn't even understand each other.

763
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:24,000
I mean, I could hardly understand when I was in New England that Gloucester was written Gloucester, and I didn't know where this place was.

764
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:34,399
And if everything was like that, and it is in English more than in any other language, that the words don't even sound like what they're written like, you'd be in a terrible mess.

765
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:42,399
But since everybody mispronounces Gloucester as Gloucester when you're over there in Massachusetts, it works fine.

766
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,760
Or is another example?

767
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,279
I'm just trying to tell you how conforming to norms is so crucial.

768
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,119
Take eating.

769
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:59,759
If in some cultures you eat with your hands in Morocco and you eat with your chopsticks in Japan and you eat with forks and knives here and so forth, that's fine.

770
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:04,639
As long as one does that, one eats with chopsticks or one eats with one hand.

771
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:13,679
But if people ate at whatever time they pleased, at whatever place they pleased, and used whatever equipment they pleased, there couldn't be any meals.

772
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:30,239
You've got to cook the food so that you can either pick it up with chopsticks or pick it up with your hands without getting burned or pick it up with a fork and people all have to roughly sit down at the same time because you you if you want to eat the food hot, it's got to be cooked for that time and so forth.

773
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:37,519
There's a whole, you could go on and on about one does in order just to eat a meal with your friends.

774
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,519
And if one didn't have that, one couldn't do it.

775
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:49,079
So it turns out that the one has a huge amount of importance.

776
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:58,359
I got sort of told the story in a different order than I wanted to, but since I got to this point, it turns out the real punchline is the middle of 167.

777
01:11:01,319 --> 01:11:14,279
We're going to go back over this next time, of course, because there's lots to be said about the difference between conforming and being a conformist and so forth that we need to talk about.

778
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:20,279
But that there is the one, and that it does a big deal of job is the middle of 167.

779
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:22,840
Heidegger sort of says it off in a hurry.

780
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,239
Well, let's start at the top in italics.

781
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:29,479
The one is an existentiale as a primordial phenomena.

782
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:32,759
It belongs to Dasein's positive constitution.

783
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:43,559
That is, I'm telling you this in this order because people misunderstand this chapter because they think that conforming is a bad thing, like being a conformist is okay.

784
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,199
But there is a positive function of conforming.

785
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:56,119
That's why I told you you couldn't eat, you couldn't talk, you couldn't get it, you couldn't drive, couldn't do anything without anything that you need to do without conforming.

786
01:11:56,119 --> 01:12:07,559
And then he says in the middle of 167 that the they itself, the one itself articulates the referential context of significance.

787
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:10,359
You see that at the middle of 167.

788
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:16,439
That's just the generalization of what I said about talking and eating and driving and going to lectures and everything.

789
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:32,079
The whole referential context of significance, all the in order towards witches, the what for us, and even the even the ultimate for the sake of witches, which has got to be a role like teaching, even though it's got to be a role like teaching like me, if it's going to do the job.

790
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:38,960
But all the roles that enable Dasein to take a stand on its own being are things that one does in this culture, like be a teacher.

791
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:46,559
I mean, one doesn't, in this culture, be a samurai, and I can't take that stand, even on being me.

792
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,119
That's just not available to me.

793
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:58,000
I can't, even though, and I certainly can't commit Harry Carey if everything goes wrong, even though that's what one does in a different culture.

794
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:05,679
So you can't have, you can't be Dasein without there being the one.

795
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,840
Now, the next question you might want to ask then is: where does it come from?

796
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:13,519
How did we get it?

797
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:22,880
And Heidegger's not very interested in that subject, but I know some of you are, and it'll come up in office hours if I don't bring it up now.

798
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,519
It's pretty obvious where you've got it, but we want to know that Heidegger knows that.

799
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,639
How did you get it?

800
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:46,880
Well, you got socialized into it by your parents, all of whom already were doing what one does, even though they didn't know that that was what one does, and doing sometimes very importantly subtle things, and sometimes, well, no, I don't want to.

801
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,319
That's getting ahead of the story there.

802
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:51,199
You don't know where I'm heading, and I don't get it yet.

803
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:55,519
Let me just talk about socialization, 246.

804
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:07,199
This guy translates it in the, oh, sorry, 246 in the history of the concept of time.

805
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,880
This guy translates it, the anyone.

806
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:20,679
The averageness, he says at the top of 246, averageness, which is doing what one normally does.

807
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,279
We'll get back to that next time.

808
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:26,599
Averageness is an existential determination of the anyone.

809
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:32,359
It is that around which everything turns for the anyone, which is essentially an issue for it.

810
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:41,880
The anyone is almost like a Dasein with it because it's got something that's an issue for it, too, namely that everybody keep conforming.

811
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,960
You can think of it this way, just for fun.

812
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:50,519
You may have heard of this theory about the selfish gene, that the genes are just sort of using us to perpetuate themselves.

813
01:14:50,520 --> 01:15:02,680
And that the main point is that your genes, which are really not yours, but somebody else's from way, way, way, way, way back, that these genes are being passed on, and we come and go, but those genes don't come and go.

814
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,399
They're there using us and so forth.

815
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:07,079
Well, it's the same for the norms.

816
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:12,680
We're just, if you think of it the way Heidegger's thinking of it, we're just sort of the vehicle for the norms.

817
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:17,319
Our parents got them from their parents, from their parents, and nobody ever knows what they've got.

818
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:25,559
And it doesn't matter whether they die or not or we die or not, the dorms are going to go on pretty much because all the norms care about.

819
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,119
This is, again, top of 246, is just perpetuating themselves.

820
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:42,439
They're sort of coercing and co-opting and subtly leading everybody into doing the average normal thing is what the norms are up to.

821
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,599
That's how they live.

822
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,880
But I haven't read the line I want, and I have to stop as soon as I do.

823
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,559
At the bottom of 246, still the history of concept of time.

824
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:57,000
The one line I know where Heidegger sort of says, well, I know it's socialization.

825
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,559
That's not my interest.

826
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:10,000
But he says, the common world, which is there primarily and into which every maturing Dasein first grows as the public world governs every interpretation of the world and of Dasein.

827
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:16,319
So he knows that there's this common world and that we, as a maturing Dasein, get socialized into it.

828
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:21,199
That's really not a big deal, except that it's interesting that he says it.

829
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,679
So, okay, we've gotten that far.

830
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:28,159
Now you read the chapter, you keep your eye on the phenomenon.

831
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,599
And one more thing.

832
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,679
He's very confused.

833
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:33,439
I forgot to tell you that.

834
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:39,679
He's very confused between conforming to the norms and being a conformist.

835
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,039
Because there's something fine about conforming to the norms.

836
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:45,439
If you don't, you're in serious trouble.

837
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,239
And there's something wrong with being a conformist.

838
01:16:48,239 --> 01:17:06,799
And Heidegger is confused in the sense, if you keep your eyes open, that he can flip back and forth within a single paragraph between telling you how positive and important the norms are, which I was doing today, and how destructive and bad the norms are, which I'm going to do next time.

839
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,639
Okay, we better stop.
