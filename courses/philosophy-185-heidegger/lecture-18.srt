00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,921
So I discovered what I see now as a common characteristic of all of the way the chart works that I'm just going to point out because it's now built into my current version.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:27,240
I make different charts every year, always trying to get why there are these three aspects and why there are these three ways of talking about these three aspects.

3
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:28,921
The bottom one, I'm not going to talk about.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,801
Dasein's essence, that isn't really part of the chart.

5
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,800
It's just another one of the threefold.

6
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:39,320
It's the chart at the top, the three things at the top which interest me a lot.

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:56,201
What I think is true now and illuminating is that he always has, for each of the three, this most primordial level, which is the most sort of abstract structural characteristic that he's trying to get at.

8
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,441
Then, that's always experienced as some particular mode of experience.

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,201
I better turn this down a little bit.

10
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,961
How do I do it, Dave?

11
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:09,000
Here, I think.

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,441
I just tried one.

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,000
It worked, I think.

14
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,720
Hello?

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,920
Yeah, I think it worked.

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,881
Okay, so in each of them, there is then experienced in a general sort of way that is thrownness in disposedness.

17
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:39,160
And disposedness could be other things other than moods, but the most obvious and prominent mode of disposedness, I think emotions might be another kind of disposedness.

18
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,121
It's all the receptivity experiences.

19
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:45,800
You could try to figure out for yourself what they might be.

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:54,841
And for instance, love is the mood, but love probably almost surely comes under disposedness and thrownness.

21
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:58,281
And now you can do it across all three.

22
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,681
Go over to the other side because we've already been there.

23
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,961
Projection.

24
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:08,321
Well, we know that that's kind of a primordial understanding.

25
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:12,321
And that's the, well, what?

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,600
That's the basic.

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,880
What do I mean by primordial understanding?

28
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:18,081
Hmm.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,880
Well, I see.

30
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:24,720
Well, it's the way Dasein takes a stand on its being, I think.

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,241
No, I don't know what I mean by that.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,521
That's a problem.

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,641
Well, it's yes, but I don't know what the phenomena is.

34
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:38,561
I mean, I know that what the phenomena of disposedness is.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,521
The phenomenon of understanding is something.

36
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:46,081
I don't know what, which maybe we'll figure it out.

37
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,480
But then it becomes concrete in.

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,321
That's the nice third one, where the main thing is it's primary understanding, and that's pressing into possibilities.

39
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,401
That's responding to affordances.

40
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:06,561
But there ought to be a more general notion of understanding, like disposedness, of which that's the main case.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
But what other cases would there be of understanding?

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,040
I don't know.

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,880
Well, then new problems.

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,841
When you make charts, it's always helpful because then you discover boxes with things in them in the chart that you don't know what the phenomena is.

45
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:22,001
And I've now had to think hard about that one.

46
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:29,521
But the middle one, which is going to become next week's, but I'll tell you now because the discourse chapter is so confusing.

47
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:38,401
But one, I made progress because in office hours I was finally with the help of a student pushed it together.

48
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:42,401
We managed to, I think, define discourse, which I've never been sure what it is.

49
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:44,401
And I don't even know if I got it right.

50
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:48,160
But I think it's, I got it here written with this asterisk.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:04:01,001
Discourse is letting be, that means, for Heidegger, letting be seen, and it's a way that the background practices organize what shows up for us and how it shows up for us.

52
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:03,880
Something like that is what's going on.

53
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,201
And then it's experienced as articulation.

54
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,800
I'll explain that next time.

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,040
And it's made concrete in talk.

56
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,560
The word that gets translated discourse is really the simple German word rede for talk.

57
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,681
And so we and there's lots of problems there.

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,000
I just I sort of think I do know how to sort those out, but I'm not going to do it now.

59
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:31,000
But I just want to give you some help as you go through trying to read this.

60
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:37,160
Because discourse is sort of like language, but it's more basic than language, but it can be put into words.

61
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,600
And that's what I'm trying to capture in the in that part of the chart.

62
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,040
Now, I think that's it for the handout.

63
00:04:48,920 --> 00:05:03,961
I see I have my work cut out for me to understand what understanding means at the level of the most general description of the phenomenon of which the we have paradigm cases, but I don't know what the general description is.

64
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:06,201
Well, I'm not going to stop to find out.

65
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:10,681
I'm going to go on to where we were, which is enough of a problem.

66
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:18,361
A student came up after class and gave me a hard hard ball to deal with.

67
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,440
And it's sort of staring you in the face, and I have to deal with it.

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,721
That is on 190.

69
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:32,521
We're now back in the midst of all that, which I'm sorry that I it takes so long to sort it out.

70
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:35,481
And everybody was looking sort of phased out last time.

71
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:41,521
I hope I will only could help you get clear about it and not spend too long on it.

72
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:44,160
But the beginning of that paragraph.

73
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,920
Well, I haven't done it.

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,040
Let's see.

75
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:50,080
Wireless mic.

76
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,200
Okay, let's see.

77
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:55,761
If you stop hearing me, raise your hand and I'll turn some other knob.

78
00:05:55,761 --> 00:06:02,321
But on 190, beginning of the first full paragraph, the very bottom of 149 in the German.

79
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:10,721
But if we never perceive equipment that is ready to hand without already understanding and interpreting it, and so forth and so forth.

80
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:23,041
But I thought you want to say, but I thought that we do receive equipment in its readiness to hand when we transparently deal with it and it withdraws.

81
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,361
Why does he say without already understanding and interpreting it?

82
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:30,481
That seems to just undermine everything I said last time.

83
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,440
But it doesn't.

84
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,641
It opens up a whole new, very interesting aspect of the phenomenon that I didn't pay attention to.

85
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:44,241
First, this nice student told me, well, maybe he was trying to get it out of what I said already.

86
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:49,441
Maybe that's how it looks to the outside person, but not to the actual perceiver.

87
00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:00,001
Remember, I said that as the actual perceiver just responds to the solicitation of the to go out, the person watching says they're taking the door as a door.

88
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:01,841
But that's not what's going on here.

89
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,881
What's going on here is something much more interesting and important.

90
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,561
And I'll just blurt it out again, and then I'll try to explain it.

91
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:21,761
The interesting thing is that the affordances or the solicitations that we respond to have already got significance built into them.

92
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:36,041
The to go out isn't just any old to go out, it's to go out to a floor which is something to walk on, to get to something maybe to eat, and it's all part of a referential totality.

93
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:58,841
And so, in the actual experience of responding to the affordance, you don't have an experience of something as something, if that means noticing the door as a door, but in a certain way, significance and interpretation are already, and I think this is the crucial phrase, in the background.

94
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,361
That permeates what it is to respond to a solicitation.

95
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:09,961
Or another way to put it is familiarity is always there.

96
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:21,641
As you find your way around the room and go through the door without noticing the latch and sit in the benches without noticing the benches unless they're pointed in the wrong direction or something, all the phenomena we talked about last time.

97
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:28,761
Well, all that's familiarity, and familiarity already includes benches as benches and doors as doors.

98
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:32,681
And it's not enough to say, well, that's how they look from the outside.

99
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:44,041
That somehow has got to permeate your experience to make sense of the soliciting you to sit in the chairs and not on the wall or the ceiling and so forth.

100
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,560
That's in there already.

101
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,841
Well, now I'll read quotes that seem to me to say this.

102
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:55,961
It's as if, here's another paradoxical way to put the problem.

103
00:08:55,961 --> 00:09:00,961
Absorbed dealing is essentially as free, Python free.

104
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:10,801
That is, you don't see something as something or take something as something if you're just in the flow.

105
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:14,160
Yet, there is no as-free seeing.

106
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,401
That's true who.

107
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:33,361
Somehow, in your experience of not noticing something as something, the experience already happens because you've been brought up in a culture in which you have that familiarity and which that something as something can solicit you.

108
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,160
I'm pretty sure that's the point.

109
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
And it's very hard.

110
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,521
So let me read what I wrote.

111
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:51,521
We always understand significance and familiarity in the sense that the solicitations already have a four-watt structure, and so only occur on the background of significance and familiarity.

112
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:56,641
Now, I owe you quotes to say that this is what's going on.

113
00:09:56,641 --> 00:10:06,801
On 187 at the bottom, I'll read that bottom little paragraph, the middle of the 147 in German.

114
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,081
The disclosiveness of the there in understanding is itself a way of Dasein's ability to be.

115
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:22,401
In the way in which its being is projected both upon the for the sake of which and upon significance, the world, there lies the disclosiveness of being.

116
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:25,121
That's already got what I want to say in it.

117
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:40,721
So when it's acting at the most basic level of understanding, it's already responding to, taking account of, or something, having in the background, I don't know how to put it very well, the significance of the world.

118
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:48,160
And then he says, understanding of being has already ta has already been taken for granted in projecting upon possibilities.

119
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,241
In projection, being is understood, though not ontologically conceived.

120
00:10:52,241 --> 00:11:01,561
That's just the most abstract way of saying that you remember the understanding of being is very close to familiarity as when we got way back when we were talking about that.

121
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:12,360
And this is a way of saying that in the background is familiarity, even though you don't notice it and certainly you don't make ontology out of it.

122
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:19,241
That is, you don't explicitly thematize it to talk th the jargon.

123
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:22,441
And now on 189, there's more of it.

124
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:25,561
So I'm going to read three more quotes.

125
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:37,001
Sort of below the middle, where he's been talking about how everything ready to hand is already for such and such a purpose.

126
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:40,201
Now I'm going to read something, let me see what.

127
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,761
Now skipping down more.

128
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:48,121
That which is disclosed in understanding, a little below the middle, the middle of the line.

129
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:56,920
That which is disclosed in understanding, that which is understood is already accessible in such a way that it's as which can be made to stand out explicitly.

130
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,800
Now we know that.

131
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,281
That's good.

132
00:11:58,281 --> 00:12:01,401
That's the move from understanding to interpretation.

133
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:05,801
The as makes up the structure of the explicitness of something that is understood.

134
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,121
It constitutes the interpretation.

135
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:15,321
In dealing with what is environmentally ready to hand by interpreting it, we see it as a table, as a door, and so forth.

136
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,160
Now that's right.

137
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:34,201
But now we have to also explain how even when we're not interpreting it, that is, paying attention, making explicit the door as the two go out, we're still somehow, it's already in our coping.

138
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,841
Now that I'm going to try to read you the quotes that say that.

139
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,241
So, let's just keep going.

140
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:56,641
So, in dealing with what's environmentally ready to hand so-and-so, so-and-so, as a door, as a bridge, that what we have thus interpreted need not, and out comes the other side, necessarily be taken apart by making an assertion which definitely characterizes it.

141
00:12:56,641 --> 00:13:03,360
Any mere pre-predicative seeing of the ready-to-hand is in itself something that already understands and interprets.

142
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:12,401
You see, that's just like that mysterious sentence that I'm trying to explain about how it's already got understanding and interpreting back in the middle of 190.

143
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,241
That was the summary, that mysterious sentence of this mysterious paragraph.

144
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:24,001
So, it's something that already understands and interprets.

145
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:29,281
And now, oh, yeah, let's go on.

146
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:34,561
But does not the absence of such an as make up the mereness of any pure perception of something?

147
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,680
We'll get back to that.

148
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,521
Let's ignore that for the time being.

149
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:46,240
Whenever we see with this kind of sight, which is coping, we already do so understandingly and interpretively.

150
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:50,241
In the mere encountering of something, it is understood in terms of a totality.

151
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
This is my punchline.

152
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:56,400
In the mere encountering of something, that's just going through the to go out.

153
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,481
It is understood in terms of a totality of involvements.

154
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:10,961
That means your coping with the solicitation has already built into it that it's to go out in order to so-and-so and so-and-so.

155
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:18,961
So, the mere encountering of something, it is understood in terms of a totality of involvements and, as such, hides in itself.

156
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:22,161
This is a funny phrase, but you can see Heidegger's got a heart.

157
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,960
Heidegger's got an impossible job here.

158
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,721
It's so hard to get the phenomena right.

159
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:32,840
So it hides in itself the explicitness of the assignment relations of the in order to, which belong to the totality.

160
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:44,840
That funny thing of it hides in itself is what I'm trying to grasp by saying it wouldn't be the kind of solicitation it was if you weren't already socialized in the familiarity with rooms and doors and so forth.

161
00:14:44,840 --> 00:15:13,481
In that sense, it hides the going out the door at the door, even though it isn't thinking about it, and it isn't even playing any of that kind of noticing, thinking kind of role, but it's the as structure is structuring your responses in the background, even though you're not having any as structure experience.

162
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:16,361
I mean, everybody, I'll get you all unhappy again.

163
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,120
I can see it now, but we've got to try to figure this out.

164
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,560
So I'm still on 189, but we're almost finished.

165
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,001
Then you can start thinking again.

166
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:26,281
So I've done that.

167
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:35,800
So even when I'm not taking something as something, that's on 190.

168
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,160
Where does he say that?

169
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:38,600
We're back to that.

170
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:48,521
Even if we never perceive equipment that is ready to hand without already understanding and interpreting, wait a minute, even if we're not taking something as something, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

171
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:50,921
Well, I don't have a quote for that.

172
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,481
That's all right.

173
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:52,761
We know that.

174
00:15:58,201 --> 00:15:59,481
Okay, that's all right.

175
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:05,001
Even when we're not taking something as something, there is still no pre-seeing.

176
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:11,201
There is never free seeing because the as is built into the structure of the world.

177
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:19,600
That's on 191, at the very top, or the very bottom of 190.

178
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:38,160
When something within the world is encountered as such, and this isn't a big as such, can countered as such, that is encountered as within the world, the thing in question already has an involvement, which is disclosed in our understanding of the world, and this involvement is one that gets laid out in interpretation.

179
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:50,001
Now, in other words, it already has an involvement in the sense, I just repeated myself, that it's taking up the whole referential totality in terms of some particular activity.

180
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:52,241
It's acting on the basis of familiarity.

181
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:58,881
But what amazes me is I haven't come to the quote, which is my favorite, where he actually says it's the background.

182
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Where, where, where, where, where, where?

183
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:02,481
Let's see.

184
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,281
You hit the next sentence.

185
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:10,800
What page was I on?

186
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,160
191.

187
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,001
It should be right around here somewhere.

188
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,040
Ah, you're right.

189
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,761
Exactly the next, at the top of 191.

190
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:20,880
The ready-to-hand is always understood in terms of a totality of involvements.

191
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,600
This totality need not be grasped explicitly by a thematic interpretation.

192
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,960
That's good.

193
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:35,360
Even if it has undergone such an interpretation, it recedes into an understanding which does not stand out from the background.

194
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,400
And this is the very mode on which it is the essential foundation of everyday circumspective interpretation.

195
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:53,001
So, everyday circumspective interpretation, where you notice something, like going out the door as the door, because something sticks or the doorknob doesn't work or something.

196
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:58,040
All that kind of interpretation, which doesn't have to be breakdowns, it can be improving.

197
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,440
He gives a whole list, right?

198
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:03,321
Hey, where is that list?

199
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,761
Zoom around here.

200
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:06,840
Eugene probably knows where it is.

201
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,400
That list of all the things that you could be doing with it.

202
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,521
Anyway, all that other stuff.

203
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,961
I mean, let's do the doorknob.

204
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:23,800
The doorknob, if it's got a problem, can get your attention, and you can see it explicitly as a doorknob.

205
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,440
And it has, and as having the function for opening doors.

206
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:37,400
But once it gets working again, it goes back into the background and just becomes the solicitation to go out.

207
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,960
And you don't have to notice it at all as a doorknob anymore.

208
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,641
It just fits into the thing.

209
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,840
You've got the quote?

210
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:46,281
Oh, that's right.

211
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:47,320
We don't really need it.

212
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,440
Also, 191, and that's it.

213
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:53,161
Finally, I'm not going to talk about this anymore.

214
00:18:53,161 --> 00:19:04,120
Anybody who wants to can come and tell me how unhappy they are in office hours and that I got it wrong, or but I'm going, or write a paper on it, I'm going to go on.

215
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:05,401
I just come up again.

216
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,720
I've added one thing new to last time.

217
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:21,640
It isn't just that the ad structure is always there in the world and goes down to the bottom of the way the world is, which is what I said last time, and that you see that when you look at the world from outside, but you don't see it when you're in it.

218
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,080
I've added something else.

219
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,521
But you do have that.

220
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:29,320
You take that up as background whenever you act at all in it.

221
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:38,880
So it isn't, so in a certain way, the ad structure is already there, and in another way, the ad structure isn't there, and Heidegger doesn't know what to say about it, and neither do I.

222
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,440
But the important thing is: remember the phenomenon.

223
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:44,081
And I think Heidegger's got his eye on the phenomenon.

224
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,441
I think I've got my eye on Heidegger on the phenomenon.

225
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:49,920
And with that, we're going on.

226
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,001
Okay, something new now.

227
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,441
It was already in the background.

228
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:54,480
Never mind background.

229
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:57,440
It was already there in some of the quotes.

230
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:14,800
But I sort of shoved it aside, and that is there is the whole interesting thesis that there is no, it isn't as if there's a meaningless brute facts out there which we give meaning to.

231
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,401
That's what Husserl thinks.

232
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:32,560
Husserl says, I would bring in the quote, but none of you care, but Husserl says that we have to give cultural predicates to the bare given objects, and he says, for instance, in using a hammer.

233
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,360
I like that quote because Husserl has been trying to understand being in time and interpret it.

234
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,360
And he did read it twice, and he made a lot of marginal comments showing that he didn't really understand it very well.

235
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,040
But he knew it was against him.

236
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,521
Anyway, the point is, Husserl, and guess what?

237
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:56,641
John Searle, who always seems to me to be channeling Husserl, says the same thing.

238
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,400
And how many have had the social reality courses?

239
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,281
Not very many.

240
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:06,560
But we take brute facts and we give them meaning.

241
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,040
The famous Searle example, I'll do the Searle demo if I have any bills.

242
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,600
Okay, you've got a bill.

243
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,400
As a brute fact.

244
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,001
It's just a piece of cellulose with ink stains on it, and it has no meaning at all.

245
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:31,400
But we take it as money, and as long as everybody in their collective intentionality takes it as money, it functions as money.

246
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,920
And that means that we lay a function or a meaning on the bare facts.

247
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:41,880
And Heiger's just going to deny that.

248
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,120
He's going to say that, what would you expect him to say?

249
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:55,080
Well, one way to say what you could expect him to say is that Searle doesn't have, and Husserl, a view of the world.

250
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,921
And they're talking about the universe.

251
00:21:56,921 --> 00:22:03,080
And the universe is made up of bare, meaningless facts, electrons and galaxies and stuff like that.

252
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,961
And normally you don't even give the meaning.

253
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:11,800
You're just not in the business of dealing with the universe unless you're in a science course.

254
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,241
But the world is meaningful all the way down and all the way back.

255
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:21,001
It's always already structured in terms of significance.

256
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:36,761
There's no place for individual designs or even the whole culture to confront the meaningless group given that science deals with and give it a meaning.

257
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,160
And you might then wonder, well, how in the world, where did this meaning come from?

258
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:45,560
I'll come back to that before we skip, we finish the meaning.

259
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:58,440
But the it starts already this issue on page 190 in that little piece that I skipped, but the bottom of 190, top of 150 in German.

260
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:05,080
In interpreting, we do not, so to speak, throw a signification over some naked thing which is present at hand.

261
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,281
We do not stick a value on it.

262
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:10,160
Function predicate is Searle's name for the value.

263
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:13,521
I think I don't remember what Husserl calls it.

264
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:25,440
But when something within the world encountered as such, the thing in question already has an involvement, that is, it's already for hammering or for going out, and that's disclosed in our understanding.

265
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:28,160
Well, that's an important move.

266
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:33,040
That separates Heidegger from, I think, everybody except Aristotle.

267
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,800
That's why he likes to go back to Aristotle.

268
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,360
And he says Aristotle was the last philosopher who could just describe the way the world ordinarily showed up.

269
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,920
And they kept on describing it the way Aristotle did until Descartes came along and smashed that.

270
00:23:47,921 --> 00:24:01,201
And Heidegger's got to get back to the understanding of the world, which Aristotle, he wasn't sort of corrupted by having Galileo around or getting in, things getting worse by having Newton around.

271
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:03,281
There's nothing wrong with Galileo and Newton.

272
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:05,920
There's nothing wrong with the bare world that they describe.

273
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:14,080
It's much better than the world of Aristotle, the physics of Aristotle, which tries to read meaning into nature.

274
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:23,840
It looks like we made a lot of progress, as far as can be seen, by getting rid of all the predicates like the rocks seek their natural place and so forth.

275
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:30,160
And not getting rid of them for our ordinary experience of the world, in fact, for appreciating them.

276
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:34,320
That's what Heidegger thinks Aristotle did and what Heidegger is doing.

277
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,921
But they shouldn't be good.

278
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,400
It looks like science works better when you don't think of the projectiles seeking their natural place.

279
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,481
You think of inertia and so forth.

280
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:47,360
But I'm not going to go, that's not what I want to talk about.

281
00:24:47,360 --> 00:25:04,761
I want to talk about the fact that the way Heidegger tries to get you to stop thinking in this way that what we first encounter is the brute-given stuff.

282
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:10,360
Like, well, to take a thorough example, because if you try to describe this, it's tricky.

283
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,401
Searle's good at it.

284
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:20,120
But I mean, you can't say if you take a door as a brute-given something, and then you attribute doorness or the point for going in and out to it.

285
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,641
So, how am I going to describe the door?

286
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:34,200
Well, I'm not good at this, but some vertical slab of wood that turns or something, you take that, try to make it as bare as you can, and then you add that it's functioning as a door.

287
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:42,440
Searle's great example, which I'm going to say more about, is when he talks about the noises that come out of people's mouths.

288
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:47,880
But that's not quite good enough yet because there are mouths in there and noises.

289
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,560
He says, then he says, an orifice opens up and an acoustic blast pumps out.

290
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,600
Neat.

291
00:25:55,001 --> 00:26:06,761
What he's trying to do is describe the bare particular, and then he says, and we, with our intentionality, individual and collective, give meaning to this acoustic blast.

292
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:13,560
But when you see what, if you sort of take away Dasein, well, that's not Searle's way of talking.

293
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,281
If you take away collective intentionality, there would just be this noise.

294
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:21,240
And what is Heidegger going to say in response to that?

295
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:30,600
Well, something like, we never experience orifices and faces opening up and noise coming out.

296
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,841
We are always already in a world from the moment we are born, or really before we're born.

297
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,560
I'll tell you about that in a minute, we're already in a world of meaning.

298
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,560
And w that what w what we but our meaning is sort of crude when we're not even born yet, but we get better and better at it.

299
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:52,960
In Wittgenstein jargon, light dawns gradually over the whole.

300
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:56,560
But we're inside this hole from the start.

301
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:13,200
That is, try to think of it this way, that if i i it it's it isn't as if at the start a f a subject which is self-contained and intelligible to itself confronts the brute fact and gives it a meaning.

302
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:28,961
As you get socialized, one, a world of of equipment gradually gets clear to you or more and more clear to you, and you get to be more and more an active user and knower.

303
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:42,160
It's just bad bad everything, bad phenomenology and even bad developmental psychology if you think that at any moment the child and Searle does say this, I think he shouldn't have.

304
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:49,281
It would be better if he hadn't, that he that the child takes this acoustic glass and gives it a meaning.

305
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:56,400
And now, just to get a get a feel for this, I mean, this Heidegger doesn't need this little fact, but it helps.

306
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,720
That it turns out that fetuses, even in the womb, respond selectively to the mother's voice.

307
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:07,200
How in the world they interview the fetus in the womb and find out about that, I have no idea.

308
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:09,521
But in fact, I believe I believe them.

309
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:20,480
So, anyway, and that's, in other words, the baby has hardly evolved into a a, you know, a a not the let alone not a dash certainly not a dasein.

310
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:27,641
It won't be a daseine until it's, I don't know, at least a few months old and has equipment and language and being with.

311
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:42,440
But already this little animal-like something or other has gotten itself into a world of making discriminations that on the basis of something significant to it.

312
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,600
Yeah, go ahead.

313
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,281
I'm happy I've been talking too long.

314
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:47,241
What do you want to say?

315
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,960
When you think about your feed in an authentic way, 167.

316
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:09,881
Oh, no, you take up your world in an authentic way.

317
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:18,840
I'll go look at it, but I can already answer what it has to be: is, I mean, if one, not everybody takes up their world in an authentic way.

318
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,920
That's Division II, that you have to come back next semester to find out what that is.

319
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:24,441
Most people never do it.

320
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:26,440
That is, yeah.

321
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:29,721
Can I say anything to give you a clue?

322
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:30,120
Not really.

323
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,721
It's a little complicated.

324
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:40,920
But anyway, but everybody takes up the world, mostly in an inauthentic way, meaning that they don't really, it's all Heidegger has a sense.

325
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:47,160
Well, I'll throw it in just to show you where things happen, what kind of things he brings into Division II.

326
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:55,400
Aristotle, he says, knows that practical wisdom, phronesis, consists in responding to the unique situation.

327
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,160
And that's because the phronymus is in a certain sense authentic.

328
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,761
That's not Aristotle's talk.

329
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,321
But most people never respond to the unique situation.

330
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,840
They always do what one does.

331
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,880
We're back to the way the one, you know, covers up everything, levels it, banalizes it.

332
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:25,840
The price of intelligibility is general, banal, standard ways of pronouncing things and of eating and of reading and thinking and sending Christmas cards and so forth.

333
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,001
All of that and getting pumpkins.

334
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:33,201
I was the Berkeley Bowl and I was just appalled at the number of pumpkins.

335
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:36,401
I mean, why can't people think of something else, anything else?

336
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,761
I mean, that just, people are so conventional.

337
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:40,800
Anyway, that's it.

338
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,080
People are conventional, and that means inauthentic.

339
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:53,121
And that means they don't take up the world in an authentic way, but they understand that pumpkins are for making jack-o'-lanterns, and that everybody does that.

340
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:55,441
And that's already intelligibility.

341
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,800
So I don't see any problem.

342
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,600
I mean, I don't know.

343
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,560
Look at the passage.

344
00:30:58,561 --> 00:30:59,201
Tell me where it is.

345
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:04,241
Now I've okay, let's look.

346
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:07,121
I don't see it yet.

347
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:13,281
Oh, yeah, if Dasein discovers the world in its own way, that's authentic, and brings it close.

348
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:15,840
That would be responding to the unique situation.

349
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,000
Maybe they, I don't know, bring home fancy corn or something.

350
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,641
Although that will soon become what everybody does.

351
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:23,920
And brings it close.

352
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:42,800
If it discloses to itself its own authentic being, all this is division two, then this discovery of the world and this disclosure of Dasein are always accomplished by clearing away of concealments and obscurities, those are the banalities, as breaking up, as a breaking up of the disguises with which Dasein bars its own way.

353
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,241
Yeah, that's just what I explained.

354
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:59,241
You grow up, so once you come out of the womb and you get better discriminations, you just don't discriminate only your mother's voice, but you understand, begin to see that maybe she's saying something, and gradually you discover that your language is English, and bit by bit light is dawning over the whole.

355
00:31:59,241 --> 00:32:24,281
But it's all a very general kind of light, that you just do what your family does, and only when you later, because of anxiety, which I'm putting off till Division II, break out of doing what one just, the banal thing one does, then you get to understand the world in a fresh way.

356
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:31,800
Heidegger's always got, and it gets clearer and later, Heidegger, an interest in the fact that the Greeks could experience things in wonder.

357
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:48,761
And wonder is what gets covered up when you know already exactly what trees are and what people are and what animals are and what they're for and what situations you do what, and you just have really good at the standard way of doing things, then you've got no wonder.

358
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:54,040
And later, Heidegger really worries how to preserve it in this culture.

359
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,320
That's not in Division II.

360
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,761
I don't want to give you false advertising.

361
00:32:56,761 --> 00:32:58,360
That's in later Heidegger.

362
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,121
And someday I'm going to teach that, but I haven't figured out when.

363
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:03,560
Okay, anyway, I've answered you.

364
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,400
You don't look answered, but you have it.

365
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,360
You just don't know it.

366
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,561
Go ahead.

367
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:13,881
Yes.

368
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,681
We can.

369
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:19,481
Yes.

370
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:20,920
You see?

371
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,241
Yes.

372
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:23,480
What then?

373
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,360
Well, no, Husserl doesn't think we discover it.

374
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,920
He thinks we give the world meaning.

375
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,880
We don't go around discovering hammers in Searle and Husserl.

376
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:40,080
We go around interpreting them by uh impl by giving them a function.

377
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:43,840
And Descartes, see in this book, just go back to the Descartes section.

378
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,880
Remember, there they were called goods, but I called them value predicates.

379
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,040
Descartes, it's all already in Descartes.

380
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:55,121
Husserl's just saying this in Car in his book, Cartesian Meditations.

381
00:33:55,121 --> 00:33:56,641
He was happy to be a Cartesian.

382
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,080
Probably the last person who was happy.

383
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,520
No, Thurley was still happy.

384
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,120
No, Thurley doesn't want to be a Cartesian, but he is anyway.

385
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,120
Because it depends on how you understand Descartes.

386
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:21,761
If you say, well, Descartes thought that there was a soul and it was separate from the body and it was immortal and all that, then of course n no, there is neither Thurley nor, what did I say, Husserl wants to be a Cartesian.

387
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:49,120
But if the Cartesian is the ontology, that's what Heidegger would say, in which there is a self-sufficient subject as a thork of meaning with intentional content in it, and the world of brute facts which have no meaning, and those they meet, so to speak, haven't influenced each other, and then they get together and you get this kind of world, that's what Heidegger's trying to say is just wrong.

388
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,680
It's just bad phenomenology.

389
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:55,600
And he says another interesting thing.

390
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:56,721
I have to find the passages.

391
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,000
I've been talking without looking.

392
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,840
But I'll say it first.

393
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:08,721
He very interestingly says, you have to do a very special amount of training to see the brute giving of a door.

394
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:16,960
Or try to hear them, try to see people's mouths as orifices and try to hear the noises coming out of my mouth as an acoustic blast.

395
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,561
It's very hard.

396
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:31,640
And painters spent a lot of trouble learning how Spuvanne, it was a life work of Cézanne to be able to paint what he was actually seeing and not already meaningful.

397
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:34,840
In fact, that's never mind, Cézanne, that's a very bad idea.

398
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:48,281
But if any painter who wants to try to paint things as they are before we interpret them and give them meaning has to go through a lot of hard work.

399
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,000
Let me read the where, let me see if I can find it.

400
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,040
I'm going to read some hand up I saw over there?

401
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:54,761
Okay, yeah.

402
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:03,480
Ah, oh well, like in the beginning of 2001, we're lucky.

403
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,761
We've got Kubrick did the phenomenology for us.

404
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:17,641
But I mean, it would have to be a kind of crude and sort of accidental thing, which maybe it needs help from a monolith.

405
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:21,241
I mean, not in the Heidegger interpretation.

406
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:26,281
But anyway, bit by bit, and by accident, people will discover equipment.

407
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:31,320
I mean, of course, most of the time, that's a very special case, the first hammer.

408
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,000
I mean, for us, maybe that's why you need a monolith, because that assumes that there was a first time.

409
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,440
And the whole Heidegger story is it's always already that way.

410
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,881
There weren't any people.

411
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:49,160
There weren't even any humanoids before there was equipment, and then one day the first one discovered the first equipment.

412
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:58,041
I now think 2001 is a bad move, except that at least they know that it would require some other intelligence to do it.

413
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:07,920
But nobody ever has to face that problem because they don't, as they gradually become human, this is the light going gradually over the whole, they will gradually start to use equipment.

414
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:10,080
After all, higher animals already use equipment.

415
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:19,360
And uh and it it just goes back until there must be some sort of very minimal sort of equipment, just like there must be some very minimal sort of language.

416
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:26,161
Nobody understands this developmental stuff, but the one thing is sure, that it isn't the way Descartes says.

417
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,121
You you go ahead if you you're looking unhappy.

418
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:34,481
Right.

419
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,201
Ah, how could they ever get it?

420
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:44,000
Well, it uh I propose the equipment, let's see if we can go back to 2001.

421
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:55,521
There must have been a lot of equipment already, and we saw that they had uh shelters anyway that they were in, and I presume they had stuff to drink out of and so forth.

422
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:08,000
And uh so that there will be it's the same point again, there would be a very rudimentary equipmental totality from the start, which just wouldn't have very much equipment in it, and there would be very crude equipment.

423
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,241
Yeah.

424
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:26,641
So that one the monkeys or whatever are able to see the state and have something that's incremented.

425
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:36,641
Because that that's that's a basic act of God that it's capable of projecting you given the environment and seeing them in terms of their possibilities for it here.

426
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,640
That sounds like it's too lucralian already.

427
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:47,121
Uh you you but I but I I see that they they don't see brute facts, in other words.

428
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:51,600
They s the hammer sort of solicit them to hit something with it.

429
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:53,641
I think you could do it that way.

430
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,160
And I think that would be fine.

431
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:06,360
I think that must be how it is for the kind of animals that drop stones on coconuts to open them and put sticks in holes to get the ants to come out and so forth.

432
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,241
How do they do it?

433
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:10,681
Well, they must see this somehow without the monolith.

434
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:25,880
They see the stick and they see the ants and they one day see the ants climbing up the stick and then they maybe push it a little nearer the anthill and gradually they get it and when they get it they pass it on and all all that kind of a monkey now uses sticks to get ants out of anthills.

435
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,680
So it doesn't so I don't think it needs dozen I'm saying to you.

436
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:38,201
It graduates at least I don't know what Heidegger thinks, but I think what Wittgenstein thinks is more what I'm saying that you just gradually do it and we don't know how to explain that.

437
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:53,481
But the one thing we don't want to do is let me put a the Wittgenstein-like spin on it, you don't want to invent some mental special capacity that we have to take the first brute fact and see it as the first equipment.

438
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,680
That's already what I would call the myth of the mental.

439
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,840
There's too much mental in them.

440
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,601
Yeah.

441
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,121
And then you, after him.

442
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:03,240
Okay, go ahead.

443
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:14,281
It's a time of, because the way I understand is that, you know, for example, you look back on Brian Colbert and she brought the human currency.

444
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:19,640
He said, well, you use currency with other currency with a great term.

445
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,840
But that's irresponsible for other currency.

446
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,400
That's all, but they they give it you responsibility.

447
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,641
You really heard the working perspective called what you would be doing.

448
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:36,761
I guess I told them that giving valitative aspects like time.

449
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:45,360
I think I think you're right.

450
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,880
I think you're on an important track.

451
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,761
And I was going to say something about it in a minute.

452
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:52,081
So let me see if I can say it yet.

453
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,241
Hmm.

454
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:06,881
So when I said that Searle makes a mistake in saying that we give the acoustic blast meaning, I think he's cutting across the distinctions you want to make.

455
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,081
There's certainly a perfectly sensible logical question.

456
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:15,920
What does it take, what do you have to add to a bare fact for it to be meaningful?

457
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,960
What do you have to add to a piece of cellulose for it to be a dollar bill?

458
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,281
And we can give a logical analysis of that.

459
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:31,681
We don't want to mix that up with a psychological claim that somebody anywhere, anytime, ever gave a piece of cellulose, the first meaning, money.

460
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:34,960
And I think that's the right way to think about it.

461
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:37,840
There are three ways to think about it.

462
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:47,041
And that is how the world, which is physics, tells us it's brute facts, gets has meaning.

463
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:52,961
One is to do what Searle and Husserl could be doing, some kind of logical analysis.

464
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:57,681
What is added to brute facts when they become meaningful?

465
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,881
And that Heidegger could go along with.

466
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,721
The next would be a kind of neuroscience.

467
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:15,601
How does the brute fact acoustic, how does this acoustic blast, which actually does come out of this orifice and hit you guys, get changed into meaningless discourse?

468
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,440
Meaningful discourse, I hope.

469
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:27,561
Well, the answer is going to be tough, and nobody's got it yet, but the neuroscientists are working away at it, and maybe they'll understand that someday.

470
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:29,480
That's a perfectly sensible question.

471
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,360
That's all on the level of physics.

472
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:46,361
I'll leave blasts hitting this piece of matter up here, finally make this whole organism behave in some kind of way that some scientists can describe.

473
00:42:46,360 --> 00:43:09,721
Okay, so it's only a mistake if you think that you can find you are actually describing an activity of a subject or a transcendental ego, or that's what I meant by the myth of the mental, which is doing something to give meaning to brute facts.

474
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,880
And that I think we're agreeing, aren't we?

475
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,400
That you can do the logical analysis without the developmental psychological claims, the constitutional claims.

476
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,881
You see, they're very fancy words for this.

477
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,760
We constitute it as a hammer.

478
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,161
That could be all right.

479
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:32,601
That could be that it's that it that it's part of a referential whole in which there are hammers.

480
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:41,561
And but it could be a bad thing that we have intentional content which enables us to stick the function hammer onto this as an activity.

481
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:43,400
But that'd be wrong.

482
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,920
Do you want to take a wait here?

483
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,281
You had a priority.

484
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:47,481
Go ahead.

485
00:43:48,761 --> 00:43:50,441
I think so.

486
00:43:51,800 --> 00:44:03,320
Speaking of my whole theory you have that we make a big line a hammer lighting with like replacement for itself.

487
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:25,601
And so it you didn't have to be like a visual rock or really kind of already put it involved in the reference hole that we're fine by doing like what you're doing.

488
00:44:25,601 --> 00:44:28,561
Well that's okay, that's part of the story.

489
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:31,361
Uh and I think that's all right.

490
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:53,681
Uh you could also, it wouldn't be Heidegger-like, say, given the kind of bodies we have, we've already got a lot of solicitations that keep us balanced in the gravitational field and moving forward rather than backward and so forth, which is already given making a meaningful spatiality of what is not anymore just Newtonian space.

491
00:44:53,681 --> 00:44:59,281
And we've got a here and a now from this always with us and we don't and so forth.

492
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:10,480
So insofar as we are already going around like human beings, the world is always already full of order and it just gets more and more so.

493
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,080
Well now I have somebody over here.

494
00:45:12,081 --> 00:45:12,800
Yeah.

495
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,600
Ah you.

496
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:16,241
Okay then you.

497
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,680
Okay, go ahead.

498
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:18,881
That's all right.

499
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,201
Yes, they're all in line the tools of being extensions of our bodies.

500
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:45,281
Um that and this that idea that we're sort of enhancing our already kind of quality um perhaps perhaps in that sense that we need to be more because if we consider ourselves to be equivalent of that sense like that that our capabilities are able already, like we're already equivalent things like that.

501
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:45,560
Okay.

502
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,960
We're able to project already.

503
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,880
That that wouldn't be very Heideggery out there if I wanted to talk about body.

504
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:56,760
You're right.

505
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,281
You're reading my mind.

506
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:01,960
Exactly what I'm thinking as I listen to you.

507
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,600
From a Heidegger point of view, that's existential.

508
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:11,241
But from a Merilloponte, that's the conditions of existence which he wants to talk about of having a world.

509
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:25,640
So, yeah, but Heidegger wants to talk about it only sort of in this very abstract but important level that without even bringing in the body, because he isn't going to bring in the developmental story.

510
00:46:25,641 --> 00:46:32,441
He's just going to say, but look, the world isn't constructed out of, let's try it this way.

511
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:52,201
The ontology that thinks you somehow have to explain how a world, a meaningful world, could be constructed out of subjects with their intentional content in them and brute facts somehow getting together, either developmentally or even logically, probably.

512
00:46:52,201 --> 00:47:01,800
If you think that's the problem, then you've already got something wrong without having to go to Merleau-Ponty and the body and existential.

513
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,481
That's Heidegger's going to do it all on the level of just the Cartesian ontology won't work.

514
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,800
And you want to say something?

515
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:18,360
I think there are a lot of examples where we want to be a thought in like unmuting.

516
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:24,520
Okay.

517
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,881
But but yeah, but the total you're actually studying the game.

518
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,480
So good, good.

519
00:47:39,121 --> 00:47:41,440
So you so you got it half right.

520
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,961
Nothing you said was wrong.

521
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,440
It's just that one of the the first half is not supposed to be very illuminating.

522
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:55,601
Of course you can find in other cultures equipment and try to figure out what it was, or you can find weird things and tr and give them a use and so forth.

523
00:47:55,601 --> 00:48:06,800
Heidegger would always say, yeah, but that's all now comes the r the part and Heidegger would say that's all in the background of a whole world of already related equipment that you can fit the frisbee in it.

524
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,521
And then comes the part that you said right.

525
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,360
And then when we do, then the frisbee pretty soon becomes part of the background.

526
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,960
That's the Heidegger point.

527
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:23,121
And just adds to the referential whole, which is always there in the solicitation of every time you see a frisbee coming by, you want to reach out and grab it.

528
00:48:23,121 --> 00:48:24,881
And so forth.

529
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,360
Good.

530
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,400
That's fine.

531
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,520
Now, one more question.

532
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:27,920
Yeah.

533
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:35,761
Well, I mean, I mean, there are a bit of world.

534
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:38,320
Not just on points of intentionality.

535
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,320
No intentionality here, but they have to discover it.

536
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:51,760
Okay.

537
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:52,481
Well.

538
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:54,480
Okay.

539
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,680
I I buy everything you say except something about your vocabulary, which we have to fix.

540
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:26,840
Intentionality becomes ambiguous in this course, because Heidegger's got a distinction, remember, between primordial intentionality, which is coping, transparent coping, which is what you're talking about, that children have a lot of, and the kind of intentionality that Searle and Husserl are interested in, which has a mental content related to an external, inner mental content related to an external world, that's later.

541
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:39,640
But by the way, just in case you think that I'm sort of beating on Searle and Husserl and it's not Heidegger's problem, there are two places where that oh, I've gotten way off in the wrong part of the book here.

542
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:41,480
Well, why don't I just catch up with us?

543
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,441
And we'll probably find, I know we'll find what I'm looking for.

544
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:53,161
So in 199, we see, yeah, good, just where I want.

545
00:49:53,161 --> 00:49:58,360
We make no advanced restriction upon the concept of meaning.

546
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,681
He's now introducing his notion of meaning.

547
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:12,041
That's going to be, let me, I better back up just for a second and say that what's happening is Husserl's got a big deal place for meaning, or Zin in German.

548
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:22,361
And so people who think like Searle have a big place in lots of analytic philosophers for intentional content, which is another way of talking about meaning.

549
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:35,081
And Heidegger's going to have his own way of talking about meaning, in which he's going to try to take away the term and the function that meaning is supposed to have and give it a new function and sort of and call that meaning.

550
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:43,960
One way to think of it just to help, meaning is this inner something that minds in the Cartesian tradition.

551
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:50,681
And Heidegger's going to make meaning the most general characteristic of the shared external world.

552
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:56,200
That it's another name for the referential totality when Heidegger takes it over.

553
00:50:56,161 --> 00:51:01,161
But now, look, and let's look at the top of 1990.

554
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,000
No, no, that's not where I want.

555
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,761
That's the second thing I want before that already, on 190.

556
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:13,120
I just wanted, this is just getting you into meaning, and then I'll go to the intentional content.

557
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:31,840
On 190, he says, No, I don't.

558
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,800
No, we've already read that.

559
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:46,641
Well, okay, I'm ready to go back to one to where I was, which is I'm catching up with myself to make sure that I've read to you what I wanted to read.

560
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:47,921
And then I will go on.

561
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,400
Yeah.

562
00:51:48,721 --> 00:51:49,681
Okay.

563
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:52,320
Now I'm ready to go on.

564
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:59,761
And that means the top of where I had it before, and now I don't know where it is.

565
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:00,721
Oh, dear.

566
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:01,921
Well, I'll find it.

567
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,600
I said I was going to find where he distinguished.

568
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:07,840
There we are, top of 199.

569
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:11,761
Right at the top, middle of 156.

570
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:19,201
We make no advanced restriction on the concept of meaning, which would confine it to signifying the content of a judgment.

571
00:52:19,201 --> 00:52:23,761
That's this inner intentional content-ish thing that he's getting from Husserl.

572
00:52:23,761 --> 00:52:36,001
But we understand it as the existential phenomenon already characterized in which the formal framework of what can be disclosed in understanding and articulated in interpretation becomes visible.

573
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,320
In other words, meaning is the referential totality in the background.

574
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,320
And that's what he wants to talk about.

575
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:55,721
And he doesn't want to sort of, he thinks, sort of beg the question and say, well, wherever meaning comes from, it must ultimately come from the intrinsic to talk like Sorrel intrinsic intentionality of human individual minds.

576
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,880
Yeah.

577
00:52:57,721 --> 00:53:10,920
I guess the same reaction to that, maybe, and because the open friendly example, and maybe the appeal, what you know when that's all regarding this, I feel a certain kind of unease.

578
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:18,840
And I think the first thing is the sense that there are too many possibilities, like supposed to be already present.

579
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:29,561
I guess the idea to say if you're trying to do a game, you are supervised, you're making sproutings or whatever, and you think, oh, well, I'm just going to take this random object, and I'm going to make it something else.

580
00:53:29,561 --> 00:53:35,481
And then the response, I guess, being, well, yeah, but that possibility was already present within your system.

581
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:41,081
On the background, yeah, on the background of the system, there was a place where you could fit it in.

582
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:54,600
Not that there was sort of a place that specifically said Frisbee or something, but if you have things that you can throw, then finally there is also some, no surprise that you find some new things that you can throw.

583
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:56,201
You're getting existential again.

584
00:53:56,201 --> 00:53:57,241
At least you know that.

585
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:03,080
But it doesn't, but whenever you're having an existential thought, leave it, don't say it for a while.

586
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:03,561
Yeah.

587
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:14,120
It's difficult to see in cases of complex tools of something in the world that has already been ready to handle.

588
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:21,961
For example, it seems like being able to know the properties of things as present in hand is the conditions.

589
00:54:22,281 --> 00:54:23,160
I think that's right.

590
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:24,040
Or making them.

591
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:24,360
Why not?

592
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,040
No, no, no.

593
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,121
Sure, you can do that.

594
00:54:32,121 --> 00:54:36,480
I mean, I just, I don't understand why this bothers everybody, but I'll and I don't want to spend much time on it.

595
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:36,800
Wait a minute.

596
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:48,401
That you go you can deal with the within the whole, on the background of the referential totality, which has got already meaningful space, meaningful time, meaningful equipment.

597
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,041
You can always look at things as present at hand and engineer a new piece of equipment, like a chip.

598
00:54:55,041 --> 00:55:08,161
And that requires getting into a completely detached scientific understanding and knowing all the things that engineers and physicists know about chips.

599
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,480
But that doesn't bother Heidegger.

600
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:27,761
It's when you make the general move that all meaning finally goes back to the the intentionality of individual subjects which make you which then become collective intentionality, which then give meaning to shared objects.

601
00:55:27,761 --> 00:55:35,200
That whole story is not going to be refuted by saying, and sometimes we can find meaningless things and give them meaning.

602
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,881
That's important.

603
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,201
Yeah.

604
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:54,000
And one of the things you've done by her father's whole meaning problem is that she knows that she doesn't work that Zen.

605
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,560
Yeah, unhelpful.

606
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:01,840
Shame on Nancy.

607
00:56:02,081 --> 00:56:06,320
She's a Ph she's a PhD of mine, but I am outraged.

608
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,161
I mean, that is no help at all.

609
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:12,480
I mean, I mean, oh, as a sort of mnemonic device, but it doesn't explain anything.

610
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:19,201
Anyway, and Heidegger's Zen has two ends.

611
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:21,441
That's with equal meaning.

612
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:29,960
Anyway, if Nancy, if that's helpful, if it helps you remember it or something, then good for her.

613
00:56:30,681 --> 00:56:32,840
I hope she's not listening to this podcast.

614
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,720
But anyway, where were we?

615
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:41,561
Well, I've got to go back to my numbers here because there's all kinds of things I want you to know about.

616
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:47,320
So he's not doing the Husserl Sero content, mental content story.

617
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:55,800
The meaning turns out to be a characteristic of familiarity or significance, as he says on 192.

618
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,641
I guess, let's look.

619
00:56:57,641 --> 00:57:00,121
And I say, would you like to read you something?

620
00:57:00,121 --> 00:57:01,721
I don't see what I want to read you.

621
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:02,921
That's not good.

622
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,001
192.

623
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:08,761
Surely that's not what I mean.

624
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:11,001
Maybe I mean 199.

625
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,800
That's much more promising.

626
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,441
Yes, the one I just read is part of it.

627
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:26,361
And now, looking further, come out with this if all of a sudden my notes are about some different book.

628
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:29,081
Give me time to figure this out.

629
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:30,601
Why is that?

630
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:34,041
192.

631
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,880
What happens on 192?

632
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,161
Well, the astronauts are the referential hole.

633
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,481
Uh-huh.

634
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,520
I got it wrong.

635
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,401
It's 193 that I'm trying to talk about.

636
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:57,000
And 193 at the top of the page is, oh, these are the basic definitions of meaning, the way Heidegger wants to take it away, so to speak, from this mental content.

637
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:03,081
Meaning is that wherein the intelligibility of something maintains itself.

638
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:07,840
That which can be articulated in a disclosure by which we understand we call meaning.

639
00:58:07,161 --> 00:58:12,960
Well, all of this is just keep thinking, referential totality, background familiarity.

640
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:17,681
That's the wherein, or the upon which, of the intelligibility.

641
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:26,561
The concept of meaning embraces the formal existential framework of what necessarily belongs to that which an understanding interpretation articulates.

642
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:39,281
Meaning is the, on the basis of which, remember, always fix that, of a projection, that's fine, in terms of which something comes that becomes intelligible as something.

643
00:58:39,601 --> 00:58:45,201
And I don't want to talk right now about forehaving foresight and so forth.

644
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,320
We'll get to that.

645
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:59,680
But anyway, just so, and a little further down, important, meaning is an existentiale of Dasein, not a property attaching to entities, lying behind them, or floating somewhere in an indeterminate domain.

646
00:58:59,681 --> 00:59:02,241
I mean, for Husserl, he's a kind of platonist.

647
00:59:02,241 --> 00:59:10,080
Meanings are in some kind of eternal in some way and not part of the everyday world.

648
00:59:10,081 --> 00:59:17,441
Heidegger wants to say, meaning is a characteristic of the everyday world and the referential totality.

649
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,281
And sort of take it over and make it part of his view of things.

650
00:59:23,281 --> 00:59:25,040
And it's the background.

651
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,800
I want to read that too.

652
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,840
Where is it?

653
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:38,560
Okay, that some strange phenomenon.

654
00:59:38,561 --> 00:59:42,080
Suddenly, my book doesn't seem to correspond to my notes.

655
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:43,361
I don't understand that.

656
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,960
Let me look a little longer.

657
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:47,440
So it's a the background.

658
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,161
Is anything about the background on 193?

659
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:58,681
It's sort of there implicitly all the time, but I thought I had a reference where he says it is explicitly not there.

660
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,201
Well, I just have to make a question.

661
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:08,121
Let's try.

662
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:09,081
Okay.

663
01:00:10,681 --> 01:00:15,000
And so meaning turns out to be not mental, not inner.

664
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,721
It's the most public and the most outer phenomenon there is.

665
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,800
We're all in it because it is this referential whole.

666
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,840
It is the world.

667
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,921
It is familiarity.

668
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:38,040
So and now, I don't know why, but I'm going to go to 207.

669
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:40,521
It seems to be something I already said.

670
01:00:44,201 --> 01:00:44,920
Oh, yeah.

671
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,361
Here's Tusserl in 207.

672
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:53,800
A little skipping ahead of where you were supposed to be, because you were supposed to read starting at 203 for next week.

673
01:00:53,800 --> 01:01:00,521
But it's the answer to the acoustic blast.

674
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,360
Exactly, Heidegger saying there isn't any acoustic blast.

675
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:09,001
Only here he's talking about other noises, the middle of 207.

676
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:21,561
When we are explicitly hearing the discourse of another, we approximately understand what is said, or to put it exactly, we are already with him in advance alongside the entity, which the discourse is about.

677
01:01:23,161 --> 01:01:26,120
Well, this is not the quote I expected, but it's a good one.

678
01:01:26,121 --> 01:01:33,000
On the other hand, what we approximately hear is not what is expressed in the utterance.

679
01:01:35,241 --> 01:01:52,960
What we hear, I take it, is something what we hear is expressed in the I don't know let me go on.

680
01:01:52,960 --> 01:02:01,521
Even in cases where the speech is indistinct or in a foreign language, what we approximately hear is unintelligible words and not a multiplicity of tone data.

681
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,320
I bet that what is expressed in the utterance has to be noises.

682
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,080
They're like, that's very odd.

683
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:10,001
I've got to check the German.

684
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,481
We're on page 164, about a third of the page down.

685
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,761
I'm going to read it.

686
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:19,281
What we proximately hear is not noises.

687
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:27,040
Even in cases where the speech is indistinct or in a foreign language, we proximately hear is unintelligible words and not a multiplicity of tone data.

688
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:29,441
That's the acoustic blast.

689
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,761
But the other place I was looking for is where he talks about the motorcycle.

690
01:02:35,761 --> 01:02:36,881
Oh, it's above that.

691
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,481
On 207, right below 164.

692
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,840
He says, it requires, and this is about the painters and so forth.

693
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:50,800
It requires a very artificial and complicated frame of mind to hear a pure noise.

694
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:55,521
So babies aren't going to go around hearing pure noises and giving them meaning.

695
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,640
It takes a special, they are already hearing their mother's voice in the womb.

696
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:09,121
Sounds are meaningful before the baby's even got a mind.

697
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:13,520
So it's artificial to hear a pure noise.

698
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:22,960
But once you've got a mind and you're trained, like a painter, or in this case, I guess a sound engineer, you can train yourself to hear pure sounds.

699
01:03:23,081 --> 01:03:24,041
They are there.

700
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:25,561
Physics isn't wrong.

701
01:03:25,561 --> 01:03:36,921
The fact that motorcycles and wagons are what we proximately hear is the phenomenal evidence that in every case the Ezein is being in the world already dwells amongst what is ready to hand within the world.

702
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:44,041
It doesn't dwell proximately alongside sensations and it doesn't give meaning to these sensations.

703
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,001
And okay, that's just backing up what I said earlier.

704
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,800
Here's the quote from Searle.

705
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,640
I put it in in quotes, so I won't get it wrong.

706
01:03:53,641 --> 01:04:01,240
The child learns to treat the sounds that come out of her own and others' mouths as standing for or meaning something.

707
01:04:01,561 --> 01:04:08,200
And the answer is supposed to be: you don't have to learn to treat the sounds coming out of the people's mouths as meaning something.

708
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:13,481
What you do have to learn is what specific meaning specific sounds have.

709
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,240
That's learning a language.

710
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:19,721
You have to learn English or whatever language you start with, and then you can learn French and German.

711
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:33,400
But that, but learning to hear what comes out of people's mouths as anything other than meaningful something or other, it requires a very special training, and then you can hear acoustic blasts.

712
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,041
That's the Heidegger way.

713
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:43,241
And as he said rightly, yeah, Searle and Husserl should never have gotten into this.

714
01:04:43,241 --> 01:04:45,641
I'm not even sure that Husserl does.

715
01:04:45,641 --> 01:04:49,561
But it's not a question of what the child learns.

716
01:04:49,561 --> 01:04:52,440
It's a question of some kind of analysis.

717
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:59,001
You can analyze what comes out of people's mouths into acoustic blasts.

718
01:04:59,001 --> 01:05:02,201
People who do phonetics have to do that.

719
01:05:02,201 --> 01:05:04,520
And that's fine.

720
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:10,640
And you can ask what gets added to this noise in order to make it meaningful.

721
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,360
That's fine.

722
01:05:08,121 --> 01:05:13,121
But you better be careful at that point.

723
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:28,720
Because Heidegger wants to say: don't go back into the ontology that says, well, if there are these brute facts, then there must be something in minds, namely intentional content, that gives the meaning.

724
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,840
That's beginning to ask where does the meaning come from.

725
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:33,920
Then you get the myth of the mental.

726
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:41,600
You can ask, sort of, what is what Heidegger's asking.

727
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,520
What do you have to add to brute facts to get meaning?

728
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,720
The answer for him is a referential totality.

729
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:58,720
That's not a developmental claim, and it's not an ontological claim about the independence of subjects and objects.

730
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:07,201
It's Heidegger's phenomenological claim that your basic ontology had better just start with the meaningful world.

731
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:08,560
And, okay, we've done it.

732
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,121
Oh, twice, in fact, so I'm not going to do it anymore.

733
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,440
Let me see how.

734
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:22,560
Okay, we've got a whole new subject in ten minutes.

735
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:29,281
Unless anybody has anything they want to say, I'm going on with something I thought I was going to finish today, but I thought we'd fun to start it.

736
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:36,720
Okay, the next, that's the story on meaning and the way Heidegger tries to take it over.

737
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:40,400
Now comes the derivation of logic.

738
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,960
That's interesting and important.

739
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:50,800
And that's when he starts going on on 195 from to assertion as a derivative mode of interpretation.

740
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:57,161
And first I want to sort of tell you what's at stake.

741
01:06:57,161 --> 01:07:17,400
I mean he's going to try to show the way you can get to the propositions and formal structures that logic deals with by leaving out more and more of the everyday meaning that we have in our ordinary use of language.

742
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,400
And why is that important?

743
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:24,760
Well, it's really important, or was I think a lot more important than it is now.

744
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:54,440
It was important because when people believed in good old-fashioned artificial intelligence, which was in the 60s and 70s, that meant they were going to use the predicate calculus to represent all intelligibility so that computers could do the, could take in acoustic blasts, turn them into propositions, calculate, well never mind that part.

745
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,201
They could never manage that part.

746
01:07:56,201 --> 01:08:02,281
But they wanted at least that computers could be, say, given a story.

747
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,840
They don't have questions about it.

748
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:09,161
And that was supposed to check the computer's understanding of the story.

749
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:21,960
And that turned out to be extremely hard because without them realizing it, the whole background was already in there in understanding even the simplest children's story.

750
01:08:23,161 --> 01:08:25,880
Let's see if I could quickly get an example.

751
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:38,480
But there was the oh, yeah, they had this example which they never could solve in the beginning of the 70s when I was teaching at MIT and they were trying to do artificial intelligence this way.

752
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:43,680
They were trying to get something like the intelligence of a three or four year old into the computer.

753
01:08:43,921 --> 01:08:50,480
And Dave was given the story: it was Jack's birthday, Mary was going to go to Jack's.

754
01:08:51,121 --> 01:08:53,760
I'll bring him a cookie, said Mary.

755
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,600
No, he's already got one.

756
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:56,560
No, not a cookie.

757
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,360
It'll have to be a poy, a poy told her or something.

758
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,360
And then the other girl says, no, he's already got one.

759
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,960
He'll make you take it back.

760
01:09:06,961 --> 01:09:10,480
And a kid can understand that, apparently, at the age of three or four or something.

761
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:16,400
But in there is the whole story about why do you not want more than one of these kinds of presents?

762
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,800
If it were a cookie, it wouldn't be that if he's already got one, he'll make you take it back.

763
01:09:20,801 --> 01:09:22,480
That would be the wrong reaction.

764
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,281
But if it's a gyroscope, that might be the right reaction.

765
01:09:27,281 --> 01:09:31,920
And then there's the question of, well, how big does this cookie be?

766
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:37,520
Are you giving him a cookie like that, or a little one?

767
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,880
And if so, maybe if he had one this big, he wouldn't want any more.

768
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:43,040
But if he had one this big, he'd like to have more.

769
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:44,001
I'm just making up.

770
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,680
No, this all really happened.

771
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:56,000
But what I'm trying to convey to you is a whole understanding of objects and which ones one wants and of business and what you can take back and what you can't take back.

772
01:09:56,001 --> 01:10:01,121
And even, oh yeah, that story doesn't even say that she's going to a birthday party.

773
01:10:01,121 --> 01:10:04,640
It just says it was Jack's birthday and Mary was going to Jack's.

774
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,920
So that the cookie was a present and that it was a birthday.

775
01:10:07,921 --> 01:10:09,600
The kid is supposed to know.

776
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:25,880
And the point of what I'm saying is, all that ought to be representable in logic, with X's and with predicates, with properties of objects and so forth, and relations between them, and rules for how to relate them.

777
01:10:26,201 --> 01:10:45,080
And people believe, I mean, John McCarthy, who's still there at Stanford, and the founder of AI, who named AI, still thinks that it must be the case that all intelligibility can be represented in predicate calculus with a few little corrections that he put in.

778
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,800
And the reason he thinks it is sort of what else could it be?

779
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:53,320
I mean, that's the structure of intelligibility, isn't it?

780
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:53,800
Logic.

781
01:10:53,801 --> 01:10:57,880
I mean, anything that's intelligible, we ought to be able to represent it in logic.

782
01:10:57,881 --> 01:11:18,840
And so the question, so if you see with Heidegger how logic is derived by leaving out more and more of the intelligibility of the world, you wouldn't be inclined to think that the residue would still get you the richness of the world and its intelligibility.

783
01:11:20,121 --> 01:11:24,440
I'll get next time to two places where Heidegger says this explicitly.

784
01:11:26,121 --> 01:11:28,360
But I didn't put them in the lecture, I realize now.

785
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:34,920
So that's one of the reasons why we should care about Heidegger's kind of derivation of logic.

786
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:43,560
That is, to show how it is that we get from everyday intelligibility to understanding formal structures.

787
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:59,241
And the other thing he's trying to do at the same time is derive a conceptual understanding and how conceptual understanding grows out of a richer kind of understanding that can't be captured with concepts.

788
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:03,320
And so he's doing both of these things at once and in a big hurry.

789
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,840
But it's interesting to, because if you see that, you might be able to do it better.

790
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:13,281
Somebody else could do a more detailed, interesting, more worked-out version of this.

791
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,480
So let me see if I can see.

792
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:36,480
He wants to show that how we get from primordial coping to our experience of objects with properties that minds can represent.

793
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:44,161
And he wants to do it without sort of helping himself to self-sufficient mental intentional content.

794
01:12:44,161 --> 01:12:56,080
He wants to, in effect, say, and he will, I'll read it in a minute, that trying to explain it in terms of the fact that we've already got meaning in our minds and concepts and so forth, it makes it too easy.

795
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:03,281
He thinks that that's just mysterious to bring in mental meanings to explain what's going on.

796
01:13:03,281 --> 01:13:14,241
He wants to try to say how we ever got to have mental meanings when we originally had this everyday meaningful world and our mind was just an empty openness to it.

797
01:13:14,241 --> 01:13:17,600
So he's got lots of problems and interesting ones.

798
01:13:19,281 --> 01:13:33,520
And what you want to finally understand is how we can believe that there's some subject or substance S with the property P and what you'd have to leave out and how you would go step by step to get there.

799
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:42,800
So he started by starting, well, with with assertions.

800
01:13:42,801 --> 01:13:51,040
And he's going to analyze assertions to see if what they are and what they do, and to what extent logic captures what they are and what they do.

801
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:54,920
On 196, back to the head.

802
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:08,040
It's about how the as structure gets modified when it becomes a formal structure.

803
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:15,400
And so he says at the top of 196, for one thing, it can be demonstrated, what can be demonstrated?

804
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,760
Well, you better begin back here on 195 at the bottom.

805
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,840
All interpretation with section 33, which is what I'm talking about.

806
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:25,480
I'm just barely able to set it up, and then we'll do it next time.

807
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,080
But let's finish setting it up.

808
01:14:27,081 --> 01:14:29,560
All interpretation is grounded on understanding.

809
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:37,161
That's what's been articulated as such in interpretation and sketched out beforehand in the understanding in general.

810
01:14:37,161 --> 01:14:39,480
Something articulable is the meaning.

811
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,680
And how that's redone.

812
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:49,880
Insofar as assertions, assertion is grounded on understanding and presents us with a derivative form in which an interpretation has been carried out.

813
01:14:49,881 --> 01:14:51,400
It too has meaning.

814
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,760
Yet this meaning can't be defined as something which occurs in a judgment.

815
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,960
He's back again about intentional content.

816
01:14:59,001 --> 01:15:06,600
In our present context, we should give an explicit analysis of assertion, and then the analysis will serve several purposes.

817
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,680
And let me just give you a feel for it.

818
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,360
So when you read it, you'll blurt out what's going on.

819
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,480
He's going to go through something that we've already seen once.

820
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,080
Keep in mind the hammer.

821
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:20,201
That first there is transparent hammering.

822
01:15:20,201 --> 01:15:24,920
Then if there's something that goes wrong, there is the hammer as too heavy.

823
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:27,560
And that's completely situational.

824
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:31,320
Formal logic's not going to be able to get that, he's going to say.

825
01:15:31,881 --> 01:15:39,600
Then you can de-whirl it and get to the hammer has weight, which is no, not situational.

826
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:45,520
And finally, you can get to the theory of this and get to the hammer has math.

827
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,440
Remember, that's what, 412?

828
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,440
Keep your eye on 412 as you read 196 and 197.

829
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,520
It's clearer on 412.

830
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,241
But that's what a kind of derivation he has in mind.

831
01:15:56,241 --> 01:16:11,121
You can go from coping to contextual noticing to decontextual seeing the properties of things, like having a certain weight, weighing five pounds, to theory.

832
01:16:12,081 --> 01:16:13,760
Remember 412.

833
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:24,241
And then you will understand what's going on when you read the bottom of 196 and all of 197, and you will see how he's going to come out in the end.

834
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,440
And the hammer stuff comes back on 200.

835
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:35,680
If that's where you'll, if you look at 200 and 412, you'll see his moves.

836
01:16:36,001 --> 01:16:38,241
And I think that's it.

837
01:16:38,241 --> 01:16:47,360
We will go over that next time, but we're also going on now to discourse, which is on 203, because that's not going to take more than 15 minutes.

838
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:47,920
Okay.
