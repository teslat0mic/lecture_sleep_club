00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,361
Okay, about the books.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,561
One more thing about the books.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,520
It's very important.

4
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,201
I'm surprised nobody asked, which translation to buy of the Being in Time.

5
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:13,120
The answer is: you've got to have the Macquarie Robinson translation.

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:27,760
You just can't make it in the course with the Stanbaugh translation, both because it's not as good and she muffs up a lot of very complicated things to make them simple, but she also makes them false or not true to what Heidi was trying to say.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,360
But basically, because the way I teach this is I'm constantly referring to Being in Time and reading things from it and explaining what they mean.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,080
And I can't, I want you to all have in front of you the same text and in sections too.

9
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:46,481
So get the one that I check in the bookstore.

10
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:52,961
That's the one they've got, the one with a black cover and white printing on it.

11
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,000
And that's the one you need.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,920
In paperback or hardcover, it doesn't matter at all, but it has to be that translation.

13
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:06,760
Now, okay, about grades, somebody is going to ask that sooner or later.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:20,840
There are two papers, count the papers, roughly 45% each, so as to leave 10% fudge factor for whether you come to discussion sections and contribute.

15
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,041
You're supposed to.

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,161
They're required.

17
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,561
In this course, you need all the help you can get.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,961
And one of the things you can do is in discussion section, say things and discover whether you're on the right track or not and get put on the right track.

19
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:43,080
So if you come to discussion sections and you're on a borderline between grades, you'll get put up to say from B plus to A minus.

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:53,080
And if you don't, or if you come to sections and don't say anything, which is just as bad as not coming, then you get put down to from A minus to B plus.

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,161
So think of it as very important that you come to discussion sections.

22
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:09,320
And if you're listening to the podcast of the lectures, it's absolutely crucial because you've got to have some sort of real live touch with the people who, with the text and the people who understand it.

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,320
We've got three TAs who really understand it, and you're going to appreciate their help.

24
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:18,121
Okay, I'm still, and any questions about that?

25
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:20,361
I'm still going through my whole list of things.

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,921
Graduate students could do a 15-page paper instead of two seven or eight page papers if they want to and if they clear it with me.

27
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:39,400
I it makes perfect sense for some people who had enough background, but it makes absolutely no sense for undergraduates to try to make a fi write a 15-page paper unless you're Bill Blattner.

28
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:40,840
So we're here we go.

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,561
Let's see what else.

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,201
No discussion.

31
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:44,360
Oh, yeah, no discussion section this week.

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,600
In philosophy, the way we do it is, how many are philosophy majors?

33
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:49,721
Wow.

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,680
Didn't know we had that many majors.

35
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:52,161
Okay.

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,041
So you guys know, or presumably.

37
00:02:55,201 --> 00:03:16,000
Anyway, the way we do it is we ignore the sections that you've been assigned to by the computer, and we put on the board the seven, because I don't understand, nobody understands, at least not in our department, how the computer can assign sections when the computer doesn't know what commitments the TAs have to seminars and courses on their own.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:36,320
And so we're going to do it our way, which is the TAs will write on the board next time three times that they can meet and each, each of the three TAs, and you'll have a choice of nine times, and then we'll give you something to write your first, second, and third choice on.

39
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,800
And then the TAs will sort them into such a way, hopefully, that everybody gets their first or second choice.

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,161
And if there's a problem, we'll have to negotiate about it.

41
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:49,120
But anyway, that's we're going to do that Thursday.

42
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:54,241
And then the first discussion sections will be on next, starting next week.

43
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:57,441
And next Monday is a holiday, which is a further complication.

44
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:03,201
If you get assigned to it, are any of you going to teach on Monday?

45
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,280
Probably, but I don't know, maybe not.

46
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:17,281
Anyway, if it turns out that we're teaching sections on Monday and you get assigned to one and there isn't one because it's a time, it's a holiday, if you can, go to somebody else's for the first week.

47
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,361
Don't sort of fall behind just because it's a holiday.

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,721
Now, I've covered, I think, everything, but I'm I was just going to make sure.

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah.

50
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,161
Besides the one you're in?

51
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,520
Uh-huh, it's an interesting question.

52
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,481
I don't know.

53
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:50,920
Uh sounds like a nice idea on on on on en princip, but maybe that if there's too many people to let the people who are really in the section talk, I guess it's like this.

54
00:04:50,921 --> 00:05:04,040
Sh you can show up to other sections if the person giving the section says it's okay, and they will make the judgment of whether you will improve the discussion and so forth or just be a bother.

55
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

56
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:07,721
Now, anything else?

57
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,600
Okay, I'm still back on my list, but I think I've come to the end of it.

58
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,201
Yeah.

59
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,801
There's going to be a website for the course.

60
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:24,120
I'll put my announcements on there and I'll put my charts on there.

61
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:31,641
Oh, on the back of the syllabus, you've got something important, which I have been talking about.

62
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,040
Oh, there's no, I haven't quite finished.

63
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:46,441
Because that's telling you which of the recommended, where in the recommended reading there is something that turns out to be relevant to what it is we're talking about that week.

64
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:48,921
And that's pretty straightforward.

65
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:53,401
What isn't straightforward is, and what I hadn't talked about, and nobody called me on it.

66
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:58,760
But I said there are these three Heidegger books under the recommended text, and that's a special case.

67
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:10,680
It's important to know that after, I don't know, 30 years of teaching, being in time, just with being in time to go on, maybe 20 years, I don't know when, but something like that.

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,921
All of a sudden, with Heidegger's, I guess it was they waited till he died.

69
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:17,801
No, I don't think so.

70
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,840
Anyway, Heidegger started publishing his posthumous papers.

71
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:36,241
Having written very few books, maybe 10 at the most, Heidegger is publishing about 200 volumes of all the lectures he gave, absolutely every one, he wrote it out and it's being published.

72
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:38,161
There are about 100 of them volumes.

73
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:42,241
Anyway, there are three lectures around the time of being in time.

74
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:52,721
And they say the things the Being in Time says, sometimes more clearly, sometimes with different examples, sometimes putting them in the context of the history of philosophy.

75
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,640
And they can be very helpful.

76
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:57,441
So, basic problems is the most interesting.

77
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:01,201
It was the course he gave on being in time, in a sense.

78
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:04,800
It was the course he gave the year being in time was published.

79
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,881
And it's interesting to look in there when it's relevant.

80
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:12,160
It's in the library.

81
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:16,481
The next one that's very helpful is the history of the concept of time.

82
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:23,280
And that's 1925, I think, which is, Being in Time is published in 29.

83
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,401
Anyway, that's an early draft of Being in Time.

84
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,800
And sometimes that's a lot clearer.

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,040
And it gets very condensed.

86
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:38,721
Heidegger seems to, I mean, what takes up several pages of the history of the concept of time can show up as a paragraph in being in time.

87
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:52,080
And then, and I explain all that on the page about the reading, and I try to tell you where to look in the concept of time, the history of the concept of time, for the relevant passages.

88
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,360
But I don't say anything about formal and transcendental logic.

89
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:03,680
And just to forestall a question, that's because I'm only telling you what to read up through the first six weeks when the first paper will be due.

90
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:08,840
Nothing in formal and transcendental logic becomes important and relevant until the second six weeks.

91
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,681
So I'll tell you what's in there.

92
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:12,281
That's after being in time.

93
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:20,201
That's a very, very interesting book, which he bought two years after being in time, in which he's sort of focusing it differently.

94
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,080
Now I've covered everything on my notes.

95
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,280
Last chance for general conversation.

96
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,800
Anybody have any loose ends?

97
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,320
It's amazing.

98
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,840
Yeah, okay.

99
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:46,520
After, well, yeah, I will, but when the time comes nearer, because I just haven't got that on my mind right now.

100
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,600
Yeah, I will, certainly.

101
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,680
How would I abandon you all after six?

102
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:54,040
That would be crazy.

103
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,600
Okay.

104
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:27,241
Oh, well, the way we do it in philosophy now, and maybe in your earlier time too, is I'll give you a list of suggested paper topics, but it'll be, it's better for you and probably will make a better paper if you come up with your own topic with something that you find is puzzling that you can straighten out or something where you think Heidegger contradicts himself or whatever, or where you think you can explain the phenomena better than he's got the phenomena of focus.

105
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:31,320
If you could do that, then you can write your own topic.

106
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:44,441
Only, you always have to clear a topic with your TA if it's not on the list of suggested topics, because we don't want to let you just go off the deep end and compare Heidegger to something that you can get incomparable with.

107
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,280
Okay.

108
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,201
Yeah.

109
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,280
I'd love to.

110
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,080
In fact, that's right here on my list.

111
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,201
It was going to come a little later, but not much.

112
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:06,880
But so let me just put it in the place where it belongs, I think.

113
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:13,680
So I've said already that Heidegger's either the most or tied for the most important philosopher in the 20th century.

114
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:21,921
And in general, that's because he's so original and he calls into question so much of traditional philosophy.

115
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,241
Let's say the same of Wittgenstein.

116
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:30,640
But Heidegger's certainly doing it very different from Wittgenstein, who's sort of starting from scratch.

117
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:50,320
Heidegger is standing on the shoulders of two very important philosophers, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and very influenced by them because they were already calling into question, radically doubting that the whole philosophical project made any sense.

118
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,920
And Heidegger, what Heidegger does is understand them very well and make them systematic.

119
00:10:55,921 --> 00:11:02,481
They each wrote in, Kierkegaard writes his books under various pseudonyms from various perspectives.

120
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,961
Nietzsche writes in aphorisms.

121
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:21,600
Heidegger, at least in the time of being in time, not later, but in the time of being in time, writes like a systematic philosopher, but he's systematically taking apart the whole philosophical tradition the way Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were starting to do it.

122
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,800
And what if and why is that important?

123
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:38,280
Well, it's because what Heidegger's arguing, and Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were already, that there's something wrong with the whole tradition, which is trying to have some kind of theoretical understanding of what it is to be a human being.

124
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:49,721
And if you understand what human beings are, and if you understand what theory is, which we haven't, I won't try to explain right now, you will see that that's not right.

125
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:53,800
That that's treating human beings as some special complicated kind of object.

126
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,760
And human beings aren't some special complicated kind of object.

127
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,160
They're something entirely different.

128
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:06,680
But if Heidegger doesn't want to go to the other extreme and say, well, then a theoretical understanding of nature must be wrong too.

129
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,400
After all, science is just one more human practice.

130
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:15,321
A popular view around here a few years ago, I hope it's losing its popularity.

131
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:27,800
Anyway, Heidegger thinks, and I like his view on this, that you can have a theoretical understanding of nature, and that that's what modern science is, and it's getting it right about nature.

132
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,000
But it makes no sense to think that you can do the human sciences that way.

133
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That means that in history, psychology, political theory, sociology, anthropology, all of those have to be dealt with differently, which means that when you hear cognitive X, cognitive science, which is supposed to be the science of the way the mind works, or cognitive psychology, or cognitive anthropology, well, from Heidegger's point of view, they're all wrong.

134
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,441
And that's an important, if that's true, given all the interest in cognitive everything, it's important to know it.

135
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:15,560
I don't know what cognitive neuroscience, I don't, I think it's probably all wrong too from Heidegger's point of view, but I'm not sure what cognitive neuroscience is committed to.

136
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:32,721
I mean, in the background, you can just think, if it looks anything like a computer model of how we do whatever we do, think, socialize, perceive, and so forth, from Heidegger's point of view, it's wrong.

137
00:13:32,721 --> 00:13:38,241
That's why I wrote my book, What Computers Can't Do, on the basis of reading Heidegger.

138
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:54,000
And had this weird effect of sort of creating a new field by bringing these two things together that were so obviously belong together because they were, Heidegger was opposing the whole idea of computer models before there were any computer models.

139
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,400
So that's why, that's one reason why he's so important.

140
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:03,601
And that's why he's so important in Anglo-American thinking.

141
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:07,441
But that's not why he's so important in continental philosophy.

142
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,040
That's really, to me, the most amazing thing.

143
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:26,641
All of continental philosophy of the last half of the 20th century, at least, is Heideggerian, or is totally based on Heidegger, and couldn't exist without Heidegger.

144
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:35,041
And for those of you who happen to know some of these people, that won't be our philosophy majors who are carefully protected from hearing about most of them.

145
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:50,321
All of them are, and I'll just tell you, Sartre, of course, being in nothingness, is, as I heard a famous French professor say, and I think rightly, a brilliant misunderstanding of being in time.

146
00:14:51,121 --> 00:15:01,441
You have to be a kind of genius like Sartre to take a book by being in time, which is anti-Cartesian through and through, and rewrite it as if it was a Cartesian book.

147
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,000
I mean, you learn a whole lot that way, but nothing much about Heidegger, I think.

148
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:15,881
But Sartre is no doubt, I mean, Sartre would be the first to say this, is this, he's just fixing up Heidegger, as any natural, intelligent French person would have to do.

149
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:24,520
But then there was a different kind of French person who really broke out of Descartes, thanks to Heidegger, and that's Merleau-Ponty.

150
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:33,241
I teach Marleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception sort of every other semester, every other year or so.

151
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,000
Nothing to look at now.

152
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:48,280
It's even, if anything, harder than being in time.

153
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,721
But it's harder than being in time because it's so badly written.

154
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,920
Whereas being in time is very clear.

155
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:59,641
Merleau-Ponty is extremely murky, but he's deep.

156
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:11,080
He takes over Heidegger two big gaps in being in time, so huge that it's sort of amazing that people didn't, I think, see them right off.

157
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:19,001
Heidegger has nothing to say about perception and being in time, which is pretty amazing, and nothing to say about the body.

158
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:24,280
And those are the two things that Merleau-Ponty thinks about, and the only two things he thinks about.

159
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:31,401
But there's a full-time job in a tremendously important book that comes in the space that Heidegger opens up.

160
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:38,041
And Merleau-Ponty talks a lot about Heidegger, hardly ever mentions him, but his vocabulary is all over the place.

161
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:47,961
And he just takes Heidegger's ontology and Heidegger's vocabulary and applies it to what it is to be an embodied human being perceiving things.

162
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,001
And so, okay, there goes him.

163
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,121
Probably not very many have heard of Pierre Bourdieu.

164
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:54,800
How many know Pierre Bourdieu?

165
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,000
Okay, well, more than I thought.

166
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:17,280
Okay, you may know that Bourdieu made a kind of, I don't know, reputation denouncing Heidegger because Bourdieu is such a strategist that on the French scene, that since Derrida had taken up Heidegger to make, to clover Derrida, Bourdieu wrote something, what is the ontology?

167
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,400
Anybody remember the book anyway about Heidegger?

168
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
But Bourdieu is a Heideggerian in two ways.

169
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:32,721
One, he told me that his first love in philosophy was Heidegger, and two, he told me that he thinks he's applying Marilla-Ponty to the social field.

170
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:38,800
And since Marleau-Ponty is applying Heidegger, Bourdieu is applying Heidegger secondhand, and he knows it.

171
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:45,681
He just, he was beating on Heidegger because that was how to get ahead in the French world at the time.

172
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:56,961
So, you see, Foucault actually said on his deathbed that the main influence on his life was Heidegger.

173
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:09,920
And he says in this famous bedside quote, where, by the way, it was complicated in French, in France.

174
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:32,241
Foucault, whereas Bourdieu got ahead by sort of bashing Heidegger, Foucault got ahead by pretending that he'd never heard of Heidegger as far as, but only on his deathbed, when he didn't have to worry about how he looked on the French scenior, did he say that he felt that he was a Heideggerian through and through, except as he says, Nietzsche went out in the end.

175
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:39,401
So the structure of Foucault's thought is Heideggerian, that he does a Nietzschean variation on it.

176
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,241
All of this you probably know.

177
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:45,800
I mean, Heidegger was a Nazi for a while, for how long isn't too clear.

178
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:57,641
But in 1935, he published his, sorry, in 57, I think it is, he published some lectures from 1935, Introduction to Philosophy, to Metaphysics.

179
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,080
What's the word?

180
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,760
Introduction to Metaphysics, in which there is the sentence that describes the inner truth and greatness of national socialism.

181
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:21,001
That is something to be upset about, and why people in France, particularly right after the war, like Merleau-Ponty and Foucault and Bourdreux and so forth, weren't going to go around saying they were Heideggerians.

182
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:26,600
But one person who really got upset about it, and he's the next one, is Habermas.

183
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:30,921
Habermas just, how many know about Habermas, the most important philosopher in Germany?

184
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,881
He just hates Heidegger.

185
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:41,960
And he, when he saw that, he, but then you, what you don't usually know is until he saw this sentence, he was a total Heideggerian.

186
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,560
He loved being in time.

187
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:48,441
He was terribly disappointed to discover that Heidegger had been a Nazi.

188
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:53,640
But, and this I liked a lot, Habermas is such a great guy.

189
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:56,521
He is so honest and so committed to philosophy.

190
00:19:56,521 --> 00:20:07,161
He actually published the following sentence in his book on the discourse of modernity: that being in time is the greatest philosophy books in Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind.

191
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:26,081
When you hear that coming from somebody who really hates Heidegger because he was a Nazi, and you see how important Habermas thinks that is, that means that when the dust clears, we're going to hear about Plato and Aristotle and Kant and Hegel and Nietzsche and Heidegger.

192
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:27,760
These are the big people.

193
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:30,560
Okay, so we've got everybody on my list now.

194
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:39,361
And Levinas, who's got his own criticism of Heidegger, but whose first book was on Heidegger, and Derrida, who you've all heard of, I think.

195
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:56,001
I found this sentence which I copied out through because I think it's sort of obvious that Derrida is a kind of Heideggerian, but he says in an interview called Hos Distion: what I have attempted to do would not have been possible without the opening of Martin Heidegger's questions.

196
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,241
So there they are, all of them.

197
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:06,241
I don't think I've left anybody out who makes hooks anybody on the scene in continental philosophy, and they are all Heideggerians.

198
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:08,160
And now finally, yeah.

199
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,681
Badr is a terrible philosopher.

200
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:17,520
I don't even care if this is being podcast.

201
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:21,360
He's a disgrace to philosophy and to France, as far as I can see.

202
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:26,481
Well, I don't think he's clear enough to be a Heideggerian.

203
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:37,360
All lies in the project are a sort of surgery from true Heideggerian.

204
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,720
We're talking about Badru, and it's Lacanian.

205
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:43,280
And Lacan is a sort of Heideggerian, too.

206
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,241
I didn't go into it.

207
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:49,280
Yes, there's a kind of maverick-Heideggerian strain there.

208
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:52,001
But I'd rather he hadn't.

209
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,321
Or doesn't, but I, but okay, I'm glad Adam knows about this.

210
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,641
I've listened to lectures by Badr.

211
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,360
I find it technically unbearable.

212
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,441
So let's see now.

213
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,480
Okay, and finally, just having, what about the American scene?

214
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,800
We talked about where Heidegger comes in in continental philosophy.

215
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,161
Well, he's coming up strong on the American scene.

216
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,880
I can give you two reasons to think so.

217
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:35,721
One is that good people in very good places, smart people, are publishing with very good publishers books on Heidegger, of which there are some here, but I didn't nearly list them all.

218
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,241
And they're working on some.

219
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:45,320
Rathol is going to bring out a new translation of Being in Time, which is going to be better than either of the ones that are around.

220
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:51,641
And there are two important philosophers, anyway, in the Anglo-American scene who do take Heidegger very seriously.

221
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:53,800
And that's Charles Taylor, on the one hand.

222
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,521
I don't know if you've ever heard of Charles Taylor, have you, anybody?

223
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:58,201
And Richard Rorty, I bet you've all heard.

224
00:22:58,201 --> 00:22:59,640
How many of you have heard of Richard Rorty?

225
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:00,120
Everybody.

226
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:04,521
Well, anyway, those are those, they take Heidegger seriously.

227
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:07,080
But that's not enough.

228
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:15,641
It's only going to be important when a whole generation of very smart students takes Heidegger, and America takes Heidegger very seriously.

229
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:31,241
I think it's about to happen because one of our PhDs, Sean Kelly, now is a tenured professor at Harvard, and he's going to be teaching very, very smart students, of graduate students, about Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, and that's going to make a difference.

230
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:37,481
So I think in the end, there will be an influence of Heidegger on American philosophy.

231
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,800
Okay, now, that's the answer to why I think Heidegger's important.

232
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Now I have to say what Heidegger says, and we will do that.

233
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,081
Let me see where we are.

234
00:23:48,360 --> 00:24:05,201
Okay, we're ready to talk about being, because this is called being in time, because it's all about being, and it's very hard to understand what Heidegger means by being, and Heidegger says it's very hard for us to understand even the question of the meaning of being.

235
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:25,040
So I will do my best for the rest of the time for another half hour to try to orient you to why somebody would be asking the question about the meaning of being and what sort of answers somebody could give, and telling you first the wrong answers, and then from Heidegger's point of view, and then Heidegger.

236
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:38,881
Okay, so that there is a traditional understanding of being that goes back way back, I mean, to Aristotle and probably Plato too for sure, Socrates.

237
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:48,961
I think Heidegger thinks that the pre-Socratics didn't have that, and he thinks the pre-Socratics were on the right track, and then they got sort of detracted.

238
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,800
I don't know what the right word is, waylaid by Plato.

239
00:24:52,800 --> 00:25:05,441
But the traditional understanding sort of comes to a big focus and clarity in Aristotle, and that is that being is a being is a substance.

240
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:14,721
The way of being of entities, the way of being of beings is to be substances.

241
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,760
That's a mouthful.

242
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,321
That means that, and you all believe that, and you've all heard that in lots of philosophy courses and endless variations.

243
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,000
So there is this lectern.

244
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,641
That's the ultimate kind of being.

245
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:31,681
And what is it?

246
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:35,760
Well, for Aristotle, it's a self-sufficient entity.

247
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,201
That's what it is to be a substance.

248
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:41,480
And it's got properties inherited in it.

249
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,121
That's the other thing that substances do.

250
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:53,321
So this is brown, and it's hard, and it's heavy, and it's probably got a lot of other properties in it too, inherited in it.

251
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,721
And the properties depend on the substances.

252
00:25:55,721 --> 00:26:03,081
You can't have the properties running around without inheriting in some substance, but the properties also have a kind of independence.

253
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:16,760
That is, the being hard and being brown and being heavy, each of those properties is self-sufficient in its own way, meaning it doesn't need any other properties to be that way.

254
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,161
And to see why that's a funny thing, why anybody would doubt it?

255
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:40,041
You've got to see that Marilla-Ponty thinks that the woolly redness of a carpet is different than the shiny redness of a fire engine and so forth, even though they all could match the same color strip red, because properties are not independent of each other, but are all holistically related in perception.

256
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,280
That's what we're not going to talk about.

257
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:55,641
But that's, because what we're going to talk about, and what Heidegger's going to talk about and reject, is what you could call an atomistic account of substance and of properties.

258
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:20,681
I don't mean it's chemical atoms, but I mean that they're, that whatever the basic elements are, now not talking about science, but just whatever the basic, I don't know, I can't think of a good word for this, except being, pieces of being are, or something like that, are independent of each other.

259
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:31,680
The properties are not affected by what substance they adhere in, they're not affected by the other properties, and the substances aren't affected by each other.

260
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,561
It's all atomistic in this.

261
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:47,840
And the opposite of atomistic is holistic, where everything is influenced by and depends on and couldn't be what it is except for everything else that's involved with it.

262
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,361
And we'll get to that in a minute.

263
00:27:49,360 --> 00:28:01,041
But right now, we've just got to see that for Aristotle and for the whole tradition, the be is to be a substance.

264
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,641
And in German, that's for Handenheit.

265
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:19,441
And that gets translated different ways in different translations, of course, and unfortunately, for Handenheit, that means presence at hand.

266
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,480
And that's how it gets translated in the big Heidegger book that you've got.

267
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,840
Presence at hand is the way of being of substances.

268
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,721
And I just tried to describe the way of being of substances.

269
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:34,961
It's this self-sufficient atomic way of being.

270
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:44,241
And that gets translated as presence at hand at hand.

271
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:54,401
And in the basic problems, for instance, it's translated as extant, which is not very good, I think, but that's how it came out.

272
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:02,241
In my commentary, I'm not sure I still believe this, but in the commentary, it's called a current.

273
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:07,480
We're naming the way of being of substances.

274
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:15,081
The way of being of substances is presence at hand, is for Handenheit, and you can translate it in lots of different ways.

275
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:30,121
That makes it all the harder in this course when you start reading, I've got to say this, when you read other texts of Heidegger, or when you read commentaries on texts of Heidegger, they're all using different words for these crucial German words.

276
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:41,640
So not only do you have to learn sort of a new language, namely Heideggerian, to read Heidegger, you've got to learn a lot of different dialects of Heideggerian to read the different translations of Heidegger.

277
00:29:41,641 --> 00:29:43,161
That makes life difficult.

278
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:44,921
But you've got to keep it in mind.

279
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,840
You've got to keep in mind and look in the glossary.

280
00:29:49,001 --> 00:30:05,721
I've mentioned that on the page I hand out about supplementary reading, because you've got to, you won't understand anything if you think that having read a lot about presence of hand and being in time, you're now reading about the occurrence and basic problems, and you don't see that it's the same thing.

281
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:09,800
And sometimes right inside of being in time, they're crucial words.

282
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:14,040
I wrote it down here because I care so much about it.

283
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:20,041
At the very bottom of the page of stuff about reading, there's this word Borau Hin.

284
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:29,961
If you don't understand, if you don't translate it right, as our translation calls it towards which, it calls it the, what else does it call it?

285
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,081
Anyway, it has to mean on the basis of which.

286
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:37,401
But that's a very, very important notion in Heidegger, but we're not ready for it yet.

287
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,680
But I want to draw a general conclusion, a warning.

288
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:52,000
When you read Being in Time, there are certain words which, if you don't get them right, you can't possibly be understanding what you're reading.

289
00:30:52,641 --> 00:31:02,561
And if you come across the towards which, and I wish I could remember, there's another wrong, on the bait, well, that's the right meaning, on the basis of which, there's one more wrong one.

290
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,521
On the basis of which is okay, in terms of which is maybe okay.

291
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:18,161
But anyway, there are certain words, and I'll warn you that you should correct, so to speak, and really, really write in the right one, because you can't understand it unless you get the right translation.

292
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:23,760
And certainly, I want to say it now because I may forget to say it when papers are becoming due.

293
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:34,881
When you're quoting Heidegger, when you're using some of these very wrong words, it's very hard to understand by you and by the person reading your paper.

294
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,400
Put in one of the okay translations.

295
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,120
These are all okay translations of presence at hand.

296
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:51,680
There are only certain words, which I don't want to go into right now, which are not okay and which completely mess up the meaning.

297
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:53,120
Okay, back to where we are.

298
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:58,560
So presence at hand is everything that is self-sufficient is a substance.

299
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:00,800
Everything that is a substance is self-sufficient.

300
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,320
Tables are substances, trees, the sun, numbers, whatever.

301
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:13,041
And that's what Aristotle was interested in describing.

302
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:37,961
And this goes through the whole history of philosophy and finally comes out in our time, as the fact that they're substances and they have properties gives you a subject and predicate understanding of the same phenomenon.

303
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:46,280
You name the substance as a subject, the table, and you predicate of it being brown, that's the property.

304
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:58,520
That leads finally to the predicate calculus, which is all about how, in general, the formal structure of substances with properties.

305
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:19,241
And then you get the funny, interesting phenomena that it looks, if you believe this ontology, as if all you need is the right story about all the subjects or substances in the world and all their properties or predicates, and how these are all related logically by formal relations.

306
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:21,401
You could describe everything.

307
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,760
Now, who would have thought anybody would believe that?

308
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,921
Well, that happens to be what people in artificial intelligence believed.

309
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,640
They're the ultimate heirs to this present at hand ontology.

310
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:49,081
John McCarthy at Stanford believes to this day, unless he's changed his mind since I last saw him, that everything intelligible about the world and about human beings can be represented in the predicate calculus.

311
00:33:49,081 --> 00:34:03,800
That's exactly what you get if in your ontology you think that the only kind of being, the only way of being, is present at hand, then everything must be understandable with present at hand.

312
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:11,561
And if you've got a formal model for understanding everything as substances with properties, you ought to be able to understand everything.

313
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:13,800
Well, that didn't work.

314
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,521
And Heidegger's got a very good account of why it didn't work.

315
00:34:18,521 --> 00:34:37,520
And now I think everybody thinks the good old, what John Hoagland, another Berkeley PhD, thinks called good old-fashioned AI, or what in more fancy talk is the model of the mind in which it has formal representations of the world, which it manipulates in logical ways.

316
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:52,321
That whole way of thinking about human beings, what happened is, sort of, you got substance ontology got turned into a research program by the people in AI, and it failed.

317
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,041
So that's one good reason for reading Heidegger, to see what happened there.

318
00:34:57,041 --> 00:35:10,161
People wasted a lot of time, and DARPA, the Defense Department, wasted a lot of money trying to get the, trying to sort of apply substance ontology, and it didn't work.

319
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:12,241
Well, why didn't it work?

320
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:15,120
Well, you can sort of intuit why it didn't work, can't you?

321
00:35:15,121 --> 00:35:29,361
I mean, if the essence of it is the self-sufficient character of the substances and their properties, of the subjects and their predicates, then if things were holistic, it wouldn't work.

322
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:48,800
And the genius of Heidegger is to take the most obvious and simple case of the holism of our world or our experience and work it out and show that it's not understandable in terms of substance and properties.

323
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,001
And moreover, substance and properties are derivative in some way from this.

324
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,440
Well, what is this?

325
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,840
What is this other way of being?

326
00:35:58,161 --> 00:36:02,241
Well, it's the being of equipment.

327
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:06,000
Heidegger takes it up talking about hammers.

328
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:29,161
And he says that what's characteristic of all equipment, only he'll just do it with hammers, is that a hammer's way of being is such that it couldn't be a hammer if it weren't for there being nails and wood and houses and people who had the skills to make pound nails into wood.

329
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:33,961
All of that has to hang together for something to be a hammer.

330
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:40,440
When I get to this, how many people's, I mean, maybe too far in the past now, anybody seen the gods must be crazy?

331
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:41,800
That's still around?

332
00:36:41,800 --> 00:37:03,720
I mean, there you get the case of something which for us is part of a whole equipmental totality, a Coke bottle in which you put liquids and it has a cap and there are Coke bottle openers and there are Coke bottle machines and there are glasses you pour it into and so forth and so forth and it gets thrown out of an airplane and lands in this tribe in Africa and they don't know what to make of it.

333
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,241
It's just a substance.

334
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:17,160
And so they try to fit it into their world by using it to roll torpillo-like things or to hit each other over the head with as a weapon and so forth.

335
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,161
But it's certainly not a Coke bottle.

336
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:26,760
There is no way for it to be a Coke bottle in that world of those people.

337
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:42,760
So the whole idea is for Heidegger that you can view a Coke bottle as a hard, greenish, sort of transparent substance, but then you miss what it is to be a Coke bottle.

338
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,041
Same with hammers.

339
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:52,881
You can regard a hammer as a wooden shank with a metal blob on the end, but that doesn't get it for what it is to be a hammer.

340
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:55,841
And it now comes a trickier move.

341
00:37:56,161 --> 00:38:09,440
You might think, well, all you need is to add something that's this wooden shank with this metal blob on the end, and it has a bunch of properties: long, hard handle and shiny, heavy, blobby end and so forth.

342
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,681
And it also has the property of being for hammering.

343
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:20,321
Aha, now it looks like you've sort of absorbed it into the substance ontology.

344
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:28,960
But, of course, that doesn't work because being for hammering suggests that, one, it leaves out why you're hammering.

345
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:38,000
And when you're hammering is something, if you just took the thing out and bashed a rock with it, you wouldn't be using a hammer.

346
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,521
You wouldn't be hammering.

347
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:52,800
Hammering is, it's something that is sort of culturally defined as this piece of equipment is for driving in nails, for attaching wood, for building houses, and so forth.

348
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,120
It's got this normative element.

349
00:38:55,121 --> 00:39:01,521
You can use a hammer as if it were a screwdriver to open a paint can, but it doesn't make it into a screwdriver.

350
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:20,080
It's got to have a place in the practices of the culture in which it is related to a lot of other equipment and to the goals, the skills of people, and to the goals of people.

351
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:24,561
So in the end, Heidegger thinks that we'll talk about this more next time.

352
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:37,721
He says the hammer has a, in order to, that I pick up the hammer, in order to hammer in nails, it has a towards which, that is, a task towards putting these pieces of wood together.

353
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:43,241
It has a final towards which, which would be, say, building a house.

354
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:55,161
And then it has even more beyond that, a for the sake of which, which is somebody building a house is doing it for the sake of shelter or for the sake of being a home builder or being a carpenter.

355
00:39:55,161 --> 00:40:02,041
Finally, this equipmental thing ends up, no, I don't want to say any more about it for the second.

356
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,280
It ends up that way.

357
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:08,201
And now I just want to write that on the board somewhere.

358
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:19,321
We're talking, so there's a second way of being, and this way of being is holistic and can't be dealt with in the substance.

359
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,001
Well, look, what's back there?

360
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,841
Nothing I can use.

361
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:24,200
Okay.

362
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,400
Well, you think I'll get the other one down.

363
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,161
Oh, well, that's an interesting problem.

364
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:31,161
Let's try it.

365
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,201
I'll get that one.

366
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,280
Okay.

367
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:43,721
So here we've got Sue Hondenheit.

368
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:48,521
Am I writing big enough to see back there?

369
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,800
Okay.

370
00:40:52,041 --> 00:41:02,201
That's a way of being that in our translation is readiness to hand.

371
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:09,881
And in my translation, I decided to call it availableness.

372
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:12,120
I regret that.

373
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:27,441
I regret it because it suggests that a hammer in a drawer still has the way of being of readiness to hand.

374
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,760
I think for Heidegger, the hammer only has the way of being of readiness to hand when you're hammering with it.

375
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,361
And so availableness is misleading.

376
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,280
Zuhandenheit is Heidegger's word, and I think readiness to hand will do.

377
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,760
I don't really have a candidate for the best translation of these.

378
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:59,040
So I'm going to use the translations, unless it's really wrong, like the way it deals with sometime.

379
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:02,400
I'm just going to stick to present at hand and presence at hand.

380
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,121
That's the way of being of substances.

381
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:13,760
And now we've got a second thing, which is readiness to hand, and that's the way of being of equipment.

382
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,760
This is the very, it's the sort of general property.

383
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,120
No, I can't say that.

384
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,401
Very hard.

385
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,201
It's what it is about equipment that makes it equipment is going to be described as readiness to hand.

386
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:33,361
And it's that whole complicated story of holism and interrelatedness with our practices, with our skills, and so forth.

387
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,400
All that goes into what it is to be a hammer.

388
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:44,401
And the name for that whole system, that way of being, is readiness to hand.

389
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,721
Okay, now let's see where we are.

390
00:42:49,920 --> 00:43:14,280
And that is why good old-fashioned AI and all these cognitivist enterprises are going to fail to begin with, is because they're all assuming that you can get along with a substance ontology and ignoring this vast amount of stuff, which are hammers and all sorts of equipment, which is so basic for what it is to have a world and be a human being.

391
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,001
And they can't account for them because they can't capture the holism of it.

392
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:27,561
In fact, the whole point of being a substance is not to be part of a holism, but to be an element in an atomic order.

393
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:41,721
And if it's true that for equipment to be equipment at all, that it needs to be fitted in this holistic structure, well, then there's a big problem, a huge problem.

394
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:48,201
And there's a lot to be said for the next few weeks about all that.

395
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:55,161
But I'm just going to go on because I want to give you the whole picture of what's going on here.

396
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:56,520
So let me see.

397
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:19,481
Oh, well, I mentioned, but we've got to come back to it, that Heidegger also sees something very interesting: that there is something which is not a property that hammers can have, and that's something which he doesn't, which he calls when he talks about it, he doesn't talk about it much, unreadiness to hand.

398
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,800
A hammer could just turn into a present-at-hand object, and it wouldn't be a hammer anymore.

399
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,041
It would just be a thing.

400
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,681
But a hammer can also be too heavy.

401
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:36,120
And if a hammer is too heavy, that's a kind of holistic something or other.

402
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:38,921
I can't call it a property, so I'll call it an aspect.

403
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:45,800
A hammer is too heavy for me doing this job with these nails and this wood in this situation.

404
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:57,441
You can't have just the property too heavy adhering in the hammer the way you can have it being heavy or being brown or being metal or something.

405
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,561
And that's again an example.

406
00:45:00,561 --> 00:45:03,201
That's a kind of situated holism.

407
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,721
Too heavy for this job, and that goes with equipment.

408
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:12,400
But I want to go on, I've got ten more minutes and talk about the third way of being.

409
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,601
There are three crucial ways of being, of which the tradition only knows one.

410
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,441
It's hard to believe.

411
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,121
I just, when I find myself saying this, I'm just always blown away.

412
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:40,881
That some things, these simple, obvious, pervasive, important things that Heidegger sees that are so clear and so incontrovertible that philosophy managed to go on for 2,000 years just not noticing it or not thinking it was worth thinking about.

413
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,521
So now we've got this one.

414
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:50,960
And now the other one is an interesting one because the third way of being, what is the third way?

415
00:45:51,920 --> 00:46:01,361
What very important way of being isn't being equipment and isn't being an object.

416
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:03,120
Somebody's going to come up with it.

417
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:03,760
Yeah.

418
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,161
Being a human being, exactly.

419
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:07,280
Being us.

420
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,001
Our way of being isn't equipment.

421
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,161
And you can treat people like equipment.

422
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:13,360
You can use them.

423
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:17,360
And you can treat people like objects, like doctors have to do.

424
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,561
You can operate on them as a piece of meat.

425
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:29,441
But we, when we're being human beings, aren't equipment and we're not objects.

426
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,120
Now, you might think, well, at least philosophers noticed that.

427
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,241
Surely they had lots to say about people.

428
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:49,401
But Heidegger thinks, and I think it's fascinating, that when they talked about people, philosophers talked about people as particular kinds of substances.

429
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,600
So the soul is a kind of substance in Plato.

430
00:46:52,601 --> 00:47:05,561
It's a substance and it's got three parts and it's sort of so independent of everything that it can be immortal and not involved in the world and not involved in time at all.

431
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:12,920
So when philosophers noticed people, they just went on with their substance ontology.

432
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,080
And you can just see it going on.

433
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,280
Descartes is interesting because he was upfront about it.

434
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,881
What did he say we were?

435
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:20,920
You must know.

436
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,401
If you're not, you better leave right away.

437
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,401
What's his name for us?

438
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,880
The cogito is, yeah, that's what we do.

439
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,360
Yes, we're a thinking substance.

440
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,040
We're a race extensa.

441
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:39,081
That's a kind of, I mean, sorry, that's what the world is.

442
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:40,760
We're a race cogitans.

443
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,921
We're a thinking substance.

444
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:50,521
But the race in there is Latin or the substance word, whozia, in Aristotle.

445
00:47:51,561 --> 00:47:55,000
And you think, well, maybe they stopped thinking that way.

446
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:55,560
But no, no.

447
00:47:55,561 --> 00:48:00,041
Leibniz has monads, and those are self-sufficient substances.

448
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:04,601
And Kant has a transcendental subject, and that's a self-sufficient substance.

449
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:15,000
I'm not so sure about Husserl, but I think Husserl thinks that we're a kind of self-sufficient something or other, which he calls transcendental subjectivity.

450
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:22,241
And it's nice to have a wonderful, brilliant, homegrown version of this, namely John Searle.

451
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:24,241
He's still got a substance ontology.

452
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:31,840
He says we're minds and we have mental states and we have intentional content.

453
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:36,081
Those of you who have the philosophy of mind from Searle will know that.

454
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:41,360
And he's clear that minds are self-sufficient, that the whole world might not exist.

455
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:46,081
We'd still have this intentional content sort of directed toward the world.

456
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:54,241
Husserl had the same view, even if there wasn't any world, because minds are self-sufficient substances.

457
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:57,440
And they also have other internal states, like beliefs.

458
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,800
You can have beliefs about all sorts of things, whether they exist or not, unicorns and so forth.

459
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:10,880
So the idea that we are substances is right there in front of us.

460
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:11,600
How many of this?

461
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,960
I wanted to ask this anyway.

462
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:15,760
How many had the Husserl course this summer?

463
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:41,280
Okay, well, I think, I don't know what Joseph told you, and Husserl's a hard person to understand, but I'm pretty sure that Husserl thought, that John Searle and Husserl think very similarly, and that they are just the latest version of the substance ontology.

464
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:50,161
That they think that we're a thinking thing or an intentional, intention-having thing, or something like that.

465
00:49:50,161 --> 00:49:55,440
Intentional content is still a very, very fundamental hot term.

466
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:04,000
That is, intentional content is what there is in the mind that points you towards objects in the world.

467
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:26,201
So when I think about something, then I, or believe something, or desire something, the something, the direction toward the something is the intentional content, and whether there is any such thing or not is another issue, because intentional content is self-sufficient.

468
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:28,520
I mean, that's amazing, but it's still around.

469
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:41,560
And you can always tell whether somebody's got that kind of view of the mind because you can ask whether you can doubt the existence of the external world.

470
00:50:41,881 --> 00:50:48,840
Thurle's quite upfront about it, that he thinks it's not interesting to doubt it, and nobody should go around trying to prove it.

471
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,320
But you can doubt it because the mind has got the content it's self-sufficient.

472
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,840
It's like the matrix.

473
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,121
Only you get switched to the mind being identical with the brain.

474
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:13,081
So that Thurley thinks we could be brains in a vat because it turns out that the substance of mind and the substance of brain are really so closely related.

475
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:15,320
But then never mind problems like that.

476
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,720
The important thing is to see that for Heidegger, we're not substances.

477
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,320
We're not consciousnesses.

478
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,320
That would be pushing us back to the thinking thing in Descartes.

479
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,201
What are we then?

480
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:28,201
What is our way of being?

481
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:34,201
Well, our way of being is a kind of activity.

482
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,720
We are what we do, Heidegger later, said.

483
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:47,480
That is, we give ourselves an identity by taking up a bunch of practices.

484
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,161
So that's, remember when I stopped and said, I don't want to say that yet.

485
00:51:51,680 --> 00:52:06,560
Now we can say that we pick up this hammer in order to drive in a nail, in order to put these pieces of wood together, in order to make a house, and now for the sake of an understanding of myself as a carpenter.

486
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:13,041
That is, all that activity amounts to taking a stand on my being.

487
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:18,320
And now we get to what is, then, what is the way of being of us?

488
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,760
Now the word Dasein comes in there.

489
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,640
What is that way of being?

490
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:32,320
Well, that way of being is to take a stand on what it is to be that sort of being.

491
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:39,520
And when I say take a stand on it, the translation says, and that's okay, it makes an issue of it.

492
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:41,921
You don't want to make it sort of conscious.

493
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:43,680
I'll talk more about that next time.

494
00:52:44,881 --> 00:52:47,760
You don't have to go around and say, I'm a carpenter.

495
00:52:48,161 --> 00:52:51,360
Your whole life, you have to take an extreme case.

496
00:52:51,360 --> 00:53:06,960
My favorite example is somebody could be a sacrificial mother, and that means that they've sort of got equipment for taking care of the kids and people who will make sure that everything gets done and they're ready to give up whatever they have, whatever they desire to do it and so forth.

497
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:13,360
They've taken a stand on themselves, defined themselves as a sacrificial mother, but they don't need to know it.

498
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,480
All they would say was, well, I'm just taking care of my children.

499
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,440
I love my children.

500
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,840
Well, everybody must feel the same way.

501
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:43,320
The point is, this Dasein, which is us, by its using equipment and acting in the world, gives itself an interpretation of what it is to be a human being in general, and a human being in that particular culture, and this particular human being, like being a teacher in this case.

502
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,000
And the name, we've got to have a name for that way of being.

503
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,840
I doubt if you know that until you read Being in Time.

504
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:53,960
The name for that way of being is existence.

505
00:53:55,241 --> 00:53:58,040
That one's easy to translate, existence.

506
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:06,440
But Heidegger says, you know, trees don't exist, and even hammers don't exist.

507
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,680
There's only one, and God doesn't exist.

508
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,720
That isn't any big deal atheist claim.

509
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:23,241
It's just a terminological claim that only human beings exist because Heidegger's going to use that word to describe the way of being of human beings.

510
00:54:23,241 --> 00:54:41,640
The way of being of human beings is that unlike hammers and trees, for human beings, they are concerned in their activity to take a stand or have an interpretation of what it is to be a human being.

511
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:46,041
That's a way of being, and he calls it existence.

512
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:52,680
So now, you've perhaps got a sort of understanding of what this question of being is.

513
00:54:53,480 --> 00:55:02,840
When you see that there are three kinds, and you see that each of them is a way of making something intelligible.

514
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:13,081
If you understand this way of being, that one, for Hondenheid, then you make substances intelligible.

515
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:14,840
You're able to deal with objects.

516
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:20,520
I didn't use the word objects because it's Descartes instead of Aristotle, but it's the same sort of notion.

517
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,920
You're able to deal with objects and make sense of them.

518
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:32,081
If you've got the understanding of being of Suhandenheit, then you're able to deal with equipment and make sense of it.

519
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:39,840
And if you've got the understanding of being, which is existence, you're able to deal with what it is to be a human being and make sense of it.

520
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:45,121
So then you can understand a crucial sentence on page 25.

521
00:55:46,161 --> 00:55:48,081
Get that piece of my book.

522
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,320
I'm going to talk with this because it's the punchline.

523
00:55:55,041 --> 00:56:01,201
He asks the bottom of 25, what is it, what is asked about is being.

524
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,640
Then he says, that which determines entities as entities.

525
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,241
I don't want to talk about that.

526
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:31,600
The crucial phrase is that on the basis of which, the Vorau Hin, which is right there, that on the basis of which entities are already understood, that means having this background skills on the basis of which you're able to cope with substances, equipment, and yourself.

527
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:41,280
And to talk about the understanding of being is to talk about the, finally, that which makes everything intelligible.

528
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:46,001
Being roughly equals intelligibility.

529
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:53,840
So things can be intelligible as substances, they can be intelligible as equipment, and they can be intelligible as people.

530
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:56,081
And what does all that have in common?

531
00:56:56,081 --> 00:57:01,840
Why are those all called modes of being, 4 Handenheit, Zuhandenheit, and Dase Hein?

532
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:05,280
That's because those are modes of intelligibility.

533
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,961
This is non-sort of going out on my own limb, because when you read Heidegger, he's never going to tell you very explicitly.

534
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:16,840
This is the most explicit sentence I know, what he's meaning by being.

535
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:31,001
He's meaning that something or other, which we haven't explained fully yet, on the basis of which beings, all three kinds of beings, are understood because you understand their way of being.

536
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,600
Okay, you look puzzled, and that's all right.

537
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,800
I mean, it's puzzling, but I've done the best I can.

538
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:39,480
See you next time.
