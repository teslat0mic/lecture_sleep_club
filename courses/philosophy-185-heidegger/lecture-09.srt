00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
So the problem remains that I'm going to go on to spatiality now.

2
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:31,200
So we're going to talk about Heidegger's attempt to give an account of our experience of space and our way of being in space and found that, that is, show how that is intelligible on the basis of Dasein's basic existential structure.

3
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:49,560
And then at the end, show how you can, by leaving out more and more of the richness and intelligibility of existential space, you can get to Cartesian or more general, physical space.

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,519
Now, that's what he wants to do today.

5
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:56,039
So I will start by reading on 134.

6
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,159
I'm going to read a lot because I figure you couldn't really understand this stuff if I didn't read it sentence by sentence and explain it.

7
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,440
And I'm not always sure that I've got it right when I do explain it.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,120
But sometimes things are simple.

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,200
Here on 134, he says what he's going to do.

10
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,360
Where?

11
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,880
Maybe it's not so simple.

12
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,000
Where is my.

13
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:31,240
Well, he's talking about Dasein isn't inside the world in the sense of included, the way chalk is included in a box.

14
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:41,880
I didn't talk about it, but in my commentary, I went on for several pages about the difference between two kinds of in, which you can say in English better than you can say in German.

15
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,719
And Heidegger would have been jealous.

16
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,159
We can talk about inclusion and involvement.

17
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:55,640
And inclusion is the way physical things are inside other physical things, and chairs are inside rooms and so forth.

18
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:04,120
And involvement in the world and with equipment and with other people is the kind of in that Dasein has.

19
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:21,080
And Heidegger is saying here at the bottom of 134 that he wants to say Dasein doesn't have the kind of in that objects have, substances, or the present at hand, to talk Heidegger, has.

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:28,080
And he did about ten lines down in section C there, which is what we're going to talk about, that's where it begins.

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,360
The aroundness of the environment and Dasein spatiality, he says, what it's on the left.

22
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:44,400
Yet, even if we deny that Dasein has any such insideness in a spatial receptacle, this does not in principle exclude it from having any spatiality at all.

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,880
It merely keeps open the way for seeing the kind of spatiality which is constituted for Dasein, then that's what he's going to set forth.

24
00:02:52,879 --> 00:03:03,760
So if we're not in some sort of receptacle like called space, in which we are some place in it, then how are we spatial?

25
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:15,840
And now I want to lay out something, because it's sort of one of the few things that's clear and illuminating, I think, is to contrast Cartesian space and existential space.

26
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,440
Maybe this has never occurred to you.

27
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:26,480
It certainly hadn't occurred to me before I read Heidegger, that there are two extremely different notions of space.

28
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,320
Well, yeah, even experiences of space, because you can get an experience of Cartesian space.

29
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,360
He'll try to show you how to do that at the end.

30
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:44,719
So let's start with existential space or lived space, the space we actually move around in and cope in.

31
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,480
It's got a center, that is, there's a here where I am.

32
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:59,200
And I'm going to keep going back and forth between this and present-at-hand Cartesian space, because that, of course, has no center, no here.

33
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,479
If you just think of the space in the universe, there's no here in the space in the universe.

34
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,320
There's only a here where a Daseine is.

35
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,239
And then when there's a here, then things can be near and far from me.

36
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,119
That is, there can be closeness.

37
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:24,520
And that he's talking about on 135, where he says the middle of the bottom paragraph.

38
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:38,920
Well, no, let's start a little four lines down in roughly in the second paragraph of section 22 on page 135, 102 in the German, all that.

39
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,119
So it says, we have been talking about what is approximately ready to hand.

40
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:49,959
This means not only those entities which we encountered first before any others, but also those which are close by.

41
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,040
Now he's doing this closeness story.

42
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,040
What is ready to hand in our everyday dealings has the character of closeness.

43
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,600
And that's what I mean when I say you can be near and far from it, and you can be close to it.

44
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:09,639
I mean, I think you want to, we need, in English, we've got a distinction, but it sort of gets covered up.

45
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,720
It's not adhered to.

46
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:23,239
But I think there is the difference between closeness and which goes with nearness and nearness, farness, closeness.

47
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:29,480
Those are all existential ways that we are related to each other and to stuff in space.

48
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,119
But and what about galaxies?

49
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,920
Well, they are a certain distance from each other.

50
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,480
And so are, so is the lectern a certain distance from the chair.

51
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:48,999
But we, and maybe you might want to say it's close to the table or near to the table, but I think it would be better not to, to try to purify.

52
00:05:48,999 --> 00:06:05,440
I think English has gotten sort of unclear about it, but I want to say, no, no, the lectern can't be close to the table, but it can be very small distance from the table or right on it.

53
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:15,280
But I think being near and far and close are something that we, only we have in relation to other stuff.

54
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:29,360
So, and so then, and in our space has in it, now the next point, directions like up and down, right and left.

55
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:32,560
That's not out there in the space in the universe.

56
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,519
In the universe, space is homogeneous.

57
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,360
Cartesian space has all points are equal.

58
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:43,600
There's no center, there's no here, and there are no places.

59
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:58,400
And Heidegger talks about that on 145, the second full paragraph, a little above the 111 in the margin.

60
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:15,200
The space which is thus disclosed, and that's the space of our copy space, our dealing space, the space which is thus disclosed with the worldhood of the world lacks the pure multiplicity of the three dimensions.

61
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,119
It doesn't lack them in a funny way.

62
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:20,480
It has something better, maybe, but it doesn't have the three dimensions.

63
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:34,959
In this disclosedness, which is closest to us, space is the pure wherein, in which positions are ordered by measurement, and situations of things are determined, and the situations of things are determined.

64
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,640
I don't know what that means.

65
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,599
What is ordered by measurement in the situations of things?

66
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,800
I wonder what that is in German.

67
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,760
That doesn't make any sense, but it doesn't matter.

68
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,640
It's not important.

69
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,160
What's important is the end of that sentence still remains hidden.

70
00:07:47,639 --> 00:08:14,599
I say, I want to stress that because every once in a while it glimmers through that Heidegger thinks that the Cartesian space is real and it's there all along and in some ways underlies this existential space, the one with centers and ups and downs and rights and lefts and so forth, just the way the present-at-hand hammer underlies the ready-to-hand hammer.

71
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:25,560
And I just say this over and over because people who read Heidegger come to the conclusion that somehow he doesn't believe that the physical space is real.

72
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,680
But he does.

73
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,039
He just thinks that it's not what we normally experience or deal with.

74
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,080
It's hidden.

75
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,400
And I'll get back to that.

76
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:51,239
But you may think I'm sort of obsessing about it, but you'll see if you read secondary sources how they can't believe that Heidegger thinks that though Descartes got it wrong about the thinking thing, there are no self-contained subjects.

77
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:56,599
There are no minds that would keep their content even if there was no world.

78
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:03,480
Descartes has just got it wrong, and Heidegger's got plenty of arguments about it, which we'll come back to next time.

79
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:08,120
But I think Heidegger thinks that Descartes got it right about race extensor.

80
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:25,479
There is this physical, homogeneous space underlying, what is the word, hidden, in our everyday coping, and we can reveal it just the way we can get to the shank and blob that is that underlies the hammer.

81
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:28,160
And remember that I keep going to repeat this, it's so important.

82
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,519
That doesn't mean that the stuff is more basic.

83
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,520
It isn't as if Cartesian space is more basic than lived space.

84
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,360
In fact, just the contrary.

85
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:42,959
Lived space is much more rich and much more intelligible than Cartesian space.

86
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:55,839
But nonetheless, if there weren't Cartesian space, which had its distances, there couldn't be here and far and near and all that.

87
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,480
Yeah.

88
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,920
No, of course not.

89
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,039
Good point, good point.

90
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,839
In fact, that's right.

91
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,840
It crossed my mind to say that.

92
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,479
Then I was trying to say too many things at once, so I didn't.

93
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,600
But it's important.

94
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:29,680
When Heidegger says that Descartes is right about the race extensa, he certainly doesn't mean that Descartes, who was doing pretty well given that all he had to go on so far was Galileo, he didn't even have Newton yet.

95
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:38,879
He thought there were chunks of extended bits and that they were organized in vortices which were objects.

96
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:48,719
Now we would say there are clouds of electrons or maybe we've gotten beyond clouds of electrons and something fields of quarks or who knows strings or whatever.

97
00:10:48,720 --> 00:11:12,519
The point isn't that Descartes got it right about what the ultimate spatialness of the the universe was, but that he saw that there was a kind of spatialness of the universe that made no reference at all to us and had in it and that it had no human meaning.

98
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,560
And that's what I think Heidegger thinks Descartes got right.

99
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:40,199
And that's our modern physics still has always will have some version of that right now, and maybe it's Einsteinian space-time, but something or other that's there that has a kind of measurements in it and those and are and is totally independent of us and is somehow the causal basis of this lived space.

100
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,800
I don't think anybody in their right mind would want to deny it.

101
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,520
And I think Heidegger is certainly a very sensible guy and doesn't want to deny it.

102
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,080
Now, yeah, Curtis.

103
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:57,560
Ah.

104
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,399
Well, okay.

105
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,999
Well, I've got.

106
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:11,560
Yes, I mean that if it weren't for its structure and its causal properties, there wouldn't be any existential space with us in it.

107
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:18,679
And he's got words like it's hidden, it's veiled, which is the same sort of thing.

108
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,839
I wonder if he's got an underlies.

109
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,960
I have another quote here, but I don't think underlies may unfortunately be my term, and you're sort of calling me on it.

110
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,080
But something, we have to have some term like that.

111
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,520
Let's see.

112
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,800
Here's another one on 134, I believe.

113
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,760
As long as I've got us into this, yes.

114
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,320
Let's try 134.

115
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,359
But yeah, this is probably the clearest statement of what I've been saying.

116
00:12:48,359 --> 00:13:35,759
At the very end of section B, that is above section C, that is about five lines above section C, there is some phenomenal justification for regarding the extensio as a basic characteristic of the world, in quotes, that's the universe, even if by recourse to this, neither the spatiality of the world, that's this world with us involved in it, nor that of entities we encounter, that is, their being near and far, even if all that, a spatiality that we proximately discover, that is where we most immediately are, even if all that, and even if Dasein itself, now I've lost myself in the sentence, so I'm going to read it again.

117
00:13:36,159 --> 00:14:01,839
There's some phenomenal justification for regarding the extensio as a basic characteristic of the world, in quotes, even if by recourse to this, neither the spatiality of the world, without quotes, nor that of the entities we encounter in our environment, the spatiality which is proximately discovered, nor even that of Dasein itself can be conceived ontologically.

118
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,679
I can't make much sense.

119
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,359
Enough, I can't parse that sentence right now, but I know what it means.

120
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:18,560
It means that you can't have an understanding of the being of Dasein and the being of our world on the basis of this Cartesian space.

121
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,399
You can't have an understanding of it.

122
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800
It won't be intelligible to you.

123
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,879
But it doesn't say, it doesn't deny what I was looking for.

124
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:30,959
But I think, but I'm getting it out of phenomenal justification.

125
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:38,479
He wants to regard the existential existential as a basic characteristic of the universe.

126
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
And what else could it be doing?

127
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:52,200
This is my point, as a basic characteristic of the universe except having a kind of structure that underlies and makes possible our experience of existential space.

128
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:52,839
Yeah.

129
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:03,239
Yes.

130
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,479
No, I know it doesn't.

131
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,999
I'm disappointed about that.

132
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,679
But I mean, but it seems to me, well, let's keep our eyes open.

133
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,120
I'm going to get back to this at the end.

134
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:19,080
I jumped ahead.

135
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:31,639
I mean, I assert, and I'm ready to be shown that I'm wrong, that Heidegger thinks that it's that there is a kind of physical space and that Descartes is right.

136
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,679
That physical space makes possible causally, structurally, our everyday space.

137
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,120
I'll try once more.

138
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:46,679
I'm really funny giving this lecture from the end back, but I can't resist now that I've got us into this.

139
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:59,879
Well, he talks at Topa 147 about the discovery of pure space, which is at the end of the top paragraph.

140
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:10,120
But he still hasn't said what Curtis challenges me to say, that in some sense it underlies and makes possible our kind of space.

141
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:29,359
Well, again, he says he wants to establish the phenomenal basis that is our experience upon which one can take the discovery of pure space as a theme.

142
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,040
Well, I'll try again, but it never says what I want it to say, but it never denies it.

143
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,080
And I think it just, I think Heidegger just thinks it's obvious.

144
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:59,280
But anyway, the end of the first full paragraph on 147, the homogeneous space of nature, that's the universe again, shows itself only when the entities we encounter are discovered in such a way that the worldly character of the ready-to-hand gets specifically deprived of its worldhood.

145
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,439
So there is a homogeneous space of nature anyway, and it does show itself to pure discovery.

146
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,879
And then you ask yourself, well, how does that relate to the space that we normally live in?

147
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:16,879
And I can't think of any other possible candidate for except that.

148
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:36,159
For instance, if it takes a long time to get from here to there because here is far from there, it's got something to do with the way the universe is, though not simply, I mean, because Heidegger talks about how sometimes it's harder than others to bike there or walk there.

149
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:46,959
Lots of our capacities are in there, but also something is in there that just makes it hard to get from here to there or takes a certain amount of time to get from here to there.

150
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,919
And that's nature, I bet.

151
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,760
But I'm going back to where I belong here.

152
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,919
So where were we?

153
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,880
There are places.

154
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,560
I was just got to places on 136.

155
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,599
And I think I read something already about that.

156
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,480
No, I didn't.

157
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,240
So let's read about places.

158
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,719
There are places in this existential space, and there are no places in Cartesian space.

159
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,159
So here's places.

160
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,239
It says equipment has its place, or else it lies around.

161
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,080
I take that to be in the workshop.

162
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,999
There's a place for the saw and a place for the hammer and all that.

163
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,479
And if you're really sloppy, your tools can just be lying around.

164
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,560
But there are places in the shared world.

165
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:38,119
The ceiling is a place for the lights, and the floor is a place for the chairs.

166
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:49,560
In our ordinary world, in a spaceship, things will have to get their places in some different way, either derivative from us, or they'll have to work it out when there isn't any ceiling and there isn't any floor.

167
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:55,719
But in our world of our practices and our workshops, the equipment has its place.

168
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm going on.

169
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:02,679
When equipment for something or other has a place, this place defines itself as the place of this equipment.

170
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,800
That's the hammer holder.

171
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:14,519
As one place out of a whole totality of places directionally lined up with each other and belonging to the context of equipment that is environmentally ready to hand.

172
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,199
Lined up with each other means that some things are nearer than others.

173
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:27,879
So the hammer's place is nearer than the jigsaw's place, which is nearer than the generator's place and so forth.

174
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:30,999
And Heidegger's just telling you that.

175
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,280
And he says more about it at the very bottom, similar to what I just said.

176
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,560
The above is what is on the ceiling, the below is what is on the floor, the behind is what is at the door.

177
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:48,599
All wares are discovered and circumspectively interpreted as we go our way in everyday dealings.

178
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,039
Good.

179
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:56,679
Already, there's a problem lurking there, which I just is part of what's going to mess up everything.

180
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:08,320
I mean the question is partly what role public space has, uh vis-à-vis the space of particular Daseins.

181
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:18,239
In some ways, space depends on where I am, me, somebody specific here, so that things can be near and far from where I am.

182
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:32,720
But the kind of spaces that's got to do with the ceiling and the floor seems to be a kind of public space, which is there is sort of not it depends on Dasein, but it doesn't depend at all on any particular Dasein.

183
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:40,639
So there seems to be two senses of space which Heidegger hasn't distinguished very well and which are very importantly different.

184
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,320
Look, I'll come back to that.

185
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,800
But right now, that's enough to say.

186
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,399
But I want to stress again, there are these public regions.

187
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:53,280
And he talks about that on 36, 136 again.

188
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,119
And so I'll look at that again.

189
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,280
I mean, where he defines regions.

190
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,760
Regions are very weird and hard to define.

191
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,400
But Heidegger's phenomenology is so fascinating.

192
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:13,199
He finds phenomena so obviously right and so peculiarly familiar and transparent that nobody's got a normal language for talking about them.

193
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:17,439
Here I'll so let's talk about regions, the middle 136.

194
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:27,759
This wither, which makes it possible for equipment to belong somewhere, and which we circumspectively keep in view ahead of us in our concern for dealings, we call the region.

195
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,959
What's a region?

196
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,520
Well, I used to think the region was the workshop, but I d I don't that's not right anymore.

197
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,839
And that's I just decided this morning.

198
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:42,080
I don't know what his name for the workshop is, but regions are much more s peculiar.

199
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:51,320
The middle of 137, right at 104, for the Germans, the middle of it, the house has its sunny side and its shady side.

200
00:21:51,320 --> 00:22:00,519
The way it's divided up into rooms is oriented towards these, and so is the arrangement within them according to their character's equipment.

201
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,560
Churches and graves are laid out in certain ways.

202
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:12,439
The regions of life and death, which are determinative for Dasein itself, show up in the way the graveyard is laid out, for instance.

203
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:15,399
So regions is a very peculiar thing.

204
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:34,359
It's sort of the, I'm just groping, the meaningful dimensions of spatial experience that have to do not with Dasein's location, but something like what concerns Dasein.

205
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:39,719
So what concerns Dasein is keeping the house warm or cool and being able to build your house.

206
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:48,919
So if you build it around here, you want to build it so that it faces the sun at the my house, which I didn't build, is brilliant.

207
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:55,800
It faces the sun at the time in the middle of December when the sun is furthest over that way.

208
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,959
And then when the sun goes way over that way, the house is so that the sun hardly shines in at all in the summer.

209
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:10,519
You can build a now I take it that's got to do with my concern with regions of light and warmth and so forth.

210
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,439
And it's, I don't know, we don't, I mean, just nobody has a word for it, so we might as well call them regions.

211
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:27,199
Anyway, that's something that public space has that physical space doesn't have.

212
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,759
And let's see now, I'm still looking at these things I wanted to talk about.

213
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,320
Wait, just a second.

214
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,159
Okay, now I was just looking at one.

215
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,720
I've already said equipment belongs somewhere.

216
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,320
So I went back to that.

217
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah, Dave.

218
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:53,679
I want to ask you the issue we were presenting earlier about weather line things.

219
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,599
Well, that might be right.

220
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,879
He certainly.

221
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:20,479
Well, I think that's nice.

222
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:34,320
I mean, I hope it's true, because in the back of my mind, and you could do it too, I sort of map this on temporality, which, of course, you can see that there is no now in the universe, which is a trickier thing and makes you dizzy when you think about it.

223
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:43,679
But in Division II, which we're not going to get to, Heidegger's got lots to say about the fact that there's no now in physical time.

224
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,119
And maybe then there's nothing sort of like what we normally call time in physics.

225
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,199
But let's not go into that.

226
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,080
But I do know, why am I saying this?

227
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,119
Just a second.

228
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,119
Oh, yeah.

229
00:24:57,439 --> 00:25:03,040
But there is something like world time in the time part, which has to do with clocks.

230
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,240
And clocks, the sun is a is like a clock, he says.

231
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,040
The clocks are just fancier versions of the sun.

232
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:16,200
They're tracking something physical, but they're tracking something physical in a way that's relating it to our projects and so forth.

233
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:24,280
It looks like here, the houses and the graveyards are tracking something physical and relating it to our projects.

234
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,040
So even though Heidegger never uses the term, I think he could and should talk about world space.

235
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:42,359
I've been saying public space, but if there's something like world time that takes account of the clocks in nature in the sun, then there's going to be world space and regions are the name for it.

236
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,560
That's what you're thinking.

237
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,520
I'll go along with that.

238
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,439
We made progress.

239
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,399
Okay, back to these juxtapositions.

240
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:56,519
So public spaces, I think I've said all I need to say about that, but I want to make sure.

241
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,560
So 137.

242
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,320
I just read that.

243
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:05,000
And yeah.

244
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,879
Okay, and then, nicely, the familiarity comes in again.

245
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:14,599
Familiarity, you know, is what I keep saying, is a very important character in all this.

246
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:32,839
Absolutely crucial, as I said last time, to get around all kinds of problems that cognitivism and AI get into about how we find our way around in the world and know at every moment what's relevant and how when something changes we know what changes and doesn't.

247
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,719
All that is this kind of familiarity.

248
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,519
And of course, this whole story about space has its own kind of familiarity, and he mentions it just in passing.

249
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,679
And he mentions it in a way which is, of course, important to me and should be to you.

250
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,000
That familiarity is always invisible.

251
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,760
It withdraws and so forth.

252
00:26:50,919 --> 00:27:11,280
You don't have to be noticing, least of all, thinking about how familiar it is that people face each other when they talk to each other, or that they move forward more easily than backward, or that the whole room here is designed to take account of the fact that I can stand up here and face you and so forth.

253
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,800
That's just totally, in his language, inconspicuous.

254
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:21,999
It would only become conspicuous if it was a room in which you could move the chairs around and see people had moved them all so that they pointed in the wrong direction.

255
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,959
You must have all gone to classrooms like that.

256
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:33,280
Then you have to move them back, and it becomes conspicuous that the teacher is supposed to be facing the students who are supposed to be facing the teacher.

257
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,359
And that whole thing is built in.

258
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,480
So he's talking at the bottom of 137: the readiness to hand which belongs to any such region.

259
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,679
And now we've got this business about houses and so forth.

260
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,960
Let's say anything in world space, we're going to say now.

261
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,239
The readiness to hand that belongs to anything in world space has the character of inconspicuous familiarity in italics.

262
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,520
I mean, though he never makes a fuss about it, he always, when he brings it in, he knows it's important.

263
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,760
And it has in it an even more primordial sense than does the being of the ready-to-hand.

264
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:22,960
That's a one-sentence condensation of the claim that even the ready-to-hand wouldn't make sense to us and be available to us if it wasn't already on a background of familiarity, of generally organizing stuff and coping with it.

265
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,119
So that he gets this punchline, I've already read two or lectures or three.

266
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,040
Our understanding of being finally goes back to familiarity.

267
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,639
And that's even more basic than the primordial intentionality of the ready-to-hand.

268
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:44,119
Familiarity is the condition that makes possible primordial intentionality.

269
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,119
It's not itself intentionality.

270
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:54,599
It's a background of something, a background of really know-how for coping with everything.

271
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,919
So, I mean, I just review that every once in a while because that's one of the clearest and importantest things.

272
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,599
So, now we've got the familiarity.

273
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,399
And what have we got?

274
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:13,479
We've already said the contrast then is present at hand, Cartesian space, which is the Cartesian extensio.

275
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:22,199
There is the three-dimensional multiplicity of positions, and they are at the bottom of 136.

276
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,320
I read this already.

277
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:34,280
They're never proximally given, where that means that's not what we come across normally and first, and it's when you're just going around in the world.

278
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:40,599
So the space has no center, it has no here, that is universe physics space.

279
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:51,000
It's homogeneous, all the points are equal, there are no places in it, it has no up and down, and no right and left, and it has distances, greater and lesser distances.

280
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:01,080
The galaxies are a lot further away from me than the Campanille, but it has no center, so it has no near and far, the way I'm using them.

281
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,159
Only where, like, I can only talk about things that are near and far from me.

282
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,800
Now, you know, I'm forcing English because you might say, well, the galaxies are pretty far from each other.

283
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:12,119
But I want to say, shouldn't say that.

284
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,839
That's really mixing levels.

285
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,440
We should say the galaxies are great distances from each other.

286
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:25,080
Whereas, and you shouldn't say somehow that the lectern is uh a very short distance from the table.

287
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,959
That's weird.

288
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,200
It's just very close and near to the table.

289
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,119
Okay, so let's see now.

290
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,799
One I just see another interesting reference.

291
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,080
What have I got in mind here?

292
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,200
Let's see.

293
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,840
No, that's fine.

294
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:04,719
Now that we've described the spatiality of the everyday, ready-to-hand dealing Daseine, I get alliteration anyway.

295
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:12,320
And so now we're going to go to the ontological condition of the possibility of that.

296
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:19,200
And that's going to be something about the way Dasein is always in the world.

297
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:31,599
So coping with things in order to, just to keep reviewing, satisfy the two for the sake of which is coping with things because it's hungry and because it needs shelter and so forth.

298
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:39,520
That's part of our coping in the world, and coping with things because you need to do things in order to be to be something.

299
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,240
So that's the way your identity requires coping.

300
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:48,639
And all that, this background coping, oh, I'm doing it again, aren't I?

301
00:31:48,799 --> 00:32:03,200
The background dealing, you need an account of how it makes possible our experience of the near and the far and of regions and of places, all the things we've just been talking about.

302
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:12,760
And and that's going to be the ontological story about how how we ontologically open up a space.

303
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,879
And now comes the most complicated and confusing term that it's time for me to explain.

304
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,199
And that's this desevering.

305
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:39,720
De severing is Heidegger's name for this abstract, or no, it's not abstract, this very familiar, concrete capability we have of coming across things as near and or and or far.

306
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,280
Now I have to say a lot about that.

307
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:45,479
I mean, it's ent thernung in German.

308
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,920
Entfernung, the normal word in German, means distance.

309
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:52,439
There's a footnote, so I don't know so I don't have to write this on the board.

310
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,799
They explain it all.

311
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:01,720
Heidegger writes it with a hyphen, ent thernung, where int means taking something away.

312
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,440
So it's the right way to translate ent fernung, it's not very pretty, is de-distancing.

313
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,240
D-E hyphen distance.

314
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:16,119
Joan Stanbaugh gets it right, which is nice for a change.

315
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:20,680
And that she's the only one who's got de-distancing.

316
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,800
These guys have got the worst translation as usual.

317
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,520
That there's no way to make any sense of this notion of what is it?

318
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,080
I can't even remember their word.

319
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,479
What?

320
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,759
Deseverance.

321
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:36,360
That's just crazy.

322
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:50,920
And I tried distance because I tried to take the word distance apart the way he takes the word enthernung, which is distance apart, and get this sense of some kind of stance in there, but I don't think dys hyphen stance means anything either.

323
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:57,080
So, whenever you see de severing, you've got to think de-distancing.

324
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,920
But now, what is de-distancing?

325
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:11,440
Well, you might think it's the basic capacity that Dasein has to get nearer things, that they are at a distance and we have a tendency to bring them close.

326
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,760
I think Heidegger does think that.

327
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:24,080
I think it's a sort of a Merlot-Ponty idea that we want to get an optimal grip on things, and getting an optimal grip on things means getting them sort of in front of us, arm's length from us.

328
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,720
But that's not what de-distancing means.

329
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,279
It's an ontological notion.

330
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,279
That would be too existential.

331
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:38,480
That would be sort of psychological, that we do have a tendency to want to bring things close.

332
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:46,800
What de-distancing is, we are the kind of being who are in the near and far business.

333
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:52,639
That is, we open up the space in which things can be near and far.

334
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,319
And that's what de-distancing is.

335
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:56,560
It's very confusing and misleading.

336
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,480
It sounds like you're removing distance, but it isn't that at all.

337
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:09,200
Dedistancing is opening up the possibility of things being distant or being near, either one.

338
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,920
Now, I owe you some quotes to try to show you that he actually is trying to say that.

339
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,240
Let's try 139.

340
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,080
Okay, yes, yes.

341
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,159
I'm going to read it with de-severing.

342
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:24,799
And no, I'm not.

343
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:25,519
I can't do it.

344
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,960
I'm going to read it with the right thing in it.

345
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,080
Okay, about 10 lines down on 139.

346
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,000
It's in the German middle of 105.

347
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:49,799
He defines it, or roughly, we use the expression de-distance in a signification which is both active and transitive.

348
00:35:50,440 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm not sure what that means, but I think maybe the active is this ontological one, that it's getting into the distance business, and transitive maybe is what you get out of it.

349
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:12,280
Then, when you're near this and far from that, that's already sort of inside the distance-playing game.

350
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:23,880
It stands for a constitutive state of Dasein's being, a state with regard to which removing something in the sense of putting it away is only a determinate factical mode.

351
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,599
That is, removing, meaning taking to a distance.

352
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:35,239
He says, whatever de-distancing means, it doesn't mean taking things further away.

353
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,960
It doesn't mean bringing them near either.

354
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
It's something more basic.

355
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:50,680
Here's this, and this is all so dense, and who knows whether I'm getting it right, but he says, de-distancing, next sentence, amounts to making the farness vanish.

356
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,280
That is making the remoteness of something disappear.

357
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,240
That means bringing it close.

358
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,639
Now, that's, I think, sorry, I misled you.

359
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,560
I mean, that's what I think is misleading.

360
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,400
I mean, he misleads us.

361
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:25,159
After all my trouble to tell you that de-distancing means a capacity of Dasein to open up an existential space in which things can be near and far and in which we can get nearer and further from them, he then messes up.

362
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,679
So that sentence seems to be to mess up.

363
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,839
It says, the distancing amounts to making the farness vanish.

364
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:34,000
No, no, it doesn't make the farness vanish.

365
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,880
It makes farness show up as a possibility.

366
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,280
That is, it makes remoteness of something disappear, bringing it close.

367
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:54,560
Dasein is, now that's when he's, according to me, I'm not sure I can, I got it right, he's falling into a talk in which it's too psychological, it's too existential.

368
00:37:54,799 --> 00:38:01,359
It's as if he wants to explain back to this Mirabel-Ponty thing, that we have a tendency to get close to things.

369
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:09,119
We would really like to get a good look at everything and get as clear a grasp on everything as we can, Mirabelau-Ponty says.

370
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,400
And you can think of it sort of evolutionarily if you want to.

371
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,520
You feel much safer and secure the clearer you got.

372
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,480
If you're going around in a fog and with your glasses off, in my case, it's very dangerous.

373
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,200
But that's not what he's talking about.

374
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,200
So all I can say is when you read this, you just have to.

375
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,639
Yeah, I was going to say, and it gets straightened out again, doesn't it?

376
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,200
Yes.

377
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,719
After saying that, wait a second.

378
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,839
Just when it looks hopeless, he straightens it out again.

379
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,159
So he says, Dasein is essentially disseverant.

380
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,480
It lets any entity be encountered close by, and that's not what we want.

381
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:54,320
De severance discovers remoteness, and remoteness, like distance, is a determinate categorial characteristic of entities whose nature is not that of Dasein.

382
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:56,719
Now, there he's getting it.

383
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,719
And now he tries to really nail it.

384
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,599
Desseverance, however, is an existentiale.

385
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:09,360
You see, it's been sounding sort of just like a kind of existenciale, a fact about how individual people deal with individual things.

386
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,599
No, it's supposed to be an existenciale.

387
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,920
That means a basic structure of Dasein's being.

388
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,999
This must be kept in mind.

389
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,879
Only, now I don't know what's going to come out of the next sentence.

390
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:36,359
Only to the extent that entities are revealed for Dasein in their de-distancedness do remoteness and remoteness and distances with regard to other things become accessible in the entities within the world.

391
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,799
I rest my case on that one.

392
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:40,119
I mean, that's the right thing to say.

393
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:47,800
That says if you ontologically, it's an existential structure of Dasein, that it's in the near-far business.

394
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:48,999
Now, hand up.

395
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,559
Yeah.

396
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Aha, interesting.

397
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:58,919
The funny thing is, he does say that exactly.

398
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,920
He uses the word released.

399
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,080
And he says, thanks to us, the space is released.

400
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:10,200
I wish I could just go to it because I'm not sure that it's how it works there.

401
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:17,639
I remember saying, gee, this is like freeing the chalk, and yet it's not like freeing the chalk either, because it's hard.

402
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,560
With the chalk, you can at least understand that in my language, you let the chalk do its thing when you free it.

403
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,119
But here, it's, I don't know what you're releasing when you do it.

404
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,199
I wish I could just open to release.

405
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:36,439
If anybody's got that kind of mind or immediately checking computer, tell me where it is.

406
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,759
But if not, I'll just take a quick look.

407
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,319
If not, we'll just have to wait till we get there.

408
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,560
But that's a very sensible question.

409
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,599
I'm afraid we have to wait.

410
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,200
If anybody, yeah, yeah.

411
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:05,840
Okay, well, let's not say freeing because I mean, maybe it's important that he says releasing it, though I don't think it's different.

412
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:22,880
So when we release spatiality or space, when we resist this kind of openness in which when we release the kind of openness in which things can be near and far, I find it very hard to understand sort of where they were before we released them.

413
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:30,720
And in fact, I just remember, this is fun, Heidegger has lots of marginal notes in here, which I haven't been talking about much.

414
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:37,599
But I did put Joan Stanbaugh on reserve in the philosophy library because she translates the marginal notes.

415
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,960
They're not in here.

416
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,400
And they're not in the normal German edition, except the collected works.

417
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,960
Anyway, and there are funny things.

418
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,399
And this one, there's a marginal comment very interestingly related to what we're talking about.

419
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,999
So I'm going to find it.

420
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:59,040
Ah, okay, here we are.

421
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:11,919
Heidegger's noticing that something's mixed up here at the top of 140 because he's talking about bringing close.

422
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,119
And when he talks about, he says, well, there are all kinds of ways to bring things close, which is true.

423
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,639
You can grab them or you can think about them and so forth.

424
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,920
And he's getting off in the wrong direction, notice, in italics.

425
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,359
In Dasein, there lies an essential tendency toward closeness.

426
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:36,399
Every time he says that, I get upset because we want not an essential tendency toward closeness, but a tendency to open up the world in which there.

427
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,520
You could have both.

428
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,200
Maybe we should just have both.

429
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,599
But then let's keep the ontic and the ontological.

430
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,839
Here's my proposal.

431
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:52,519
Ontologically, we have or sort of are this tendency to open up a space in which things can be near and far.

432
00:42:52,840 --> 00:43:02,119
In fact, ontically, we tend to prefer that we get close to things than that they get far away.

433
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:08,200
So we can have it both ways as long as we keep the ontological one not being closeness.

434
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:08,679
Yeah.

435
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:12,999
You found the release passage?

436
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,880
Great.

437
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,679
Oh, is there a freed passage too?

438
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:21,319
Whoa, what are we doing back there?

439
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:22,599
Okay, tell me about it.

440
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:30,520
Yeah, well, this is just our analysis.

441
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,080
There's shown that what we have found within the world.

442
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:35,080
Where are you on 114?

443
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:38,760
So, section 18 about.

444
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:41,880
Okay.

445
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:45,160
I see something about freed there, yeah.

446
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:45,559
Yeah.

447
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:50,520
World has very freed, of course, the circle freedom.

448
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:54,599
So what do you get out of that?

449
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,800
World without it, of course.

450
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:03,479
And then freed in the sense that you can come close to us in a certain effect with concern.

451
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:05,720
Okay.

452
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,800
Well, the question is sort of, what was it freed from?

453
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,119
And from not being close to us.

454
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:16,599
Okay, well, a lot of people want to help me out.

455
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:18,199
Go ahead, Tyler, and then each of you.

456
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,480
Go ahead.

457
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,799
Freed from being homogeneous.

458
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:24,959
Okay.

459
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,560
Okay.

460
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:31,439
Don't you find that sort of so unintuitive?

461
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:43,599
I mean, why you would think that it was a sort of captive of homogeneousness, and when it gets all this distancing in it near and far, it's now released from its captivity.

462
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,760
Then I can only say to myself, aha, it's doing its near and far thing, but I find that very weird.

463
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,919
Okay, wait, let me, yeah.

464
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,759
No, sir, there were two other hands, weren't there?

465
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:54,960
I mean, I just want to.

466
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,799
Oh, well, go ahead.

467
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,520
One hand disappeared.

468
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:08,480
From being disclosed or by disclosing.

469
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,080
Yeah, we free things by disclosing them, that's sure.

470
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:20,239
Or better, or discovering them, depending on whether we're on an ontological level where we're disclosing stuff.

471
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,199
Discovering is freeing, according to Heidegger.

472
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:31,199
My problem is, and you can use words any way you please, I just find that so unintuitive.

473
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:38,159
But you know, if it makes you happy, anybody, then it's all yours, yes.

474
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,239
Bringing it into relevancy to your own design.

475
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:44,879
That's good.

476
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,720
That's the truth.

477
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:57,759
Now, why you would call freeing it, since it's as if it's been imprisoned, but now you rescued it so you can be relevant, you know, get related to it, that's what seems to me so peculiar.

478
00:45:57,759 --> 00:46:04,560
He's certainly talking about bringing it into your familiar world where you can deal with it.

479
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,479
And he calls it freeing.

480
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,959
And when he deals with space, he's the one who started all this.

481
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,559
He calls it when you release it.

482
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:17,959
That is, when you do your de-distancing thing and open up a space in which things can be near and far.

483
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:21,240
You've released existential space.

484
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:23,879
Okay, if that makes anybody happy, then let them be happy.

485
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,320
Last comment, yeah.

486
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:27,560
What?

487
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,959
It's nowhere.

488
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,439
Right.

489
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,639
I'm happy to say it's nowhere, but it sounds like it's imprisoned nowhere and you've rescued it.

490
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:46,919
I mean, released and freed in their normal meaning means that something's got to be unfree and you free it.

491
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,119
And I just don't get it.

492
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:49,399
Okay, your last comment.

493
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:49,880
Yeah.

494
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:03,000
How this is what?

495
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:12,599
For our circumstances, well, I don't know.

496
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,759
He does say that the existential space is released in the de-distancing.

497
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:17,800
That's what he started.

498
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:19,639
I don't want to spend more time on it.

499
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:23,719
If other people have, ah, you're the last one, I keep saying.

500
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:24,040
Okay.

501
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,680
They've been freed.

502
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:36,760
Only, only, only, I think you could find that helpful.

503
00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:45,240
I mean, whether they were, whether they've been freed or whether they're being freed or whether they're about to be freed, I swear it's the same problem.

504
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:47,000
Okay, now wait a minute.

505
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,920
I want to go back to this.

506
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,200
Yes.

507
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,720
Yes.

508
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:59,119
One possibility of a gripretation, maybe, is that it's freedom that doesn's brought for life somehow.

509
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,919
That before, without us, space is stagnant.

510
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,799
I mean, it changes physically speaking, but there's no involvement.

511
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:10,400
And only once the involvement begins, it becomes free.

512
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,279
Well, that's how I capture it.

513
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,119
It gets to do its thing.

514
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,720
I mean, it was just doing nothing, and now it's doing something.

515
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,920
That's the only way I can talk about it.

516
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,839
It's free to do whatever it can do.

517
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,479
And before that, it was just lying there.

518
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,279
Okay, I don't, now, certainly there's no reason to talk more about this.

519
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,840
It can't be that important, I swear.

520
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:41,360
And I don't even know if the marginal note is important anymore, but it's fun to see that he's getting confused about closeness.

521
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:46,880
Because remember now, closeness is a very tricky term at the top of 140.

522
00:48:46,880 --> 00:49:00,720
Closeness can be this ontic business of getting nearer and further, and we can throw in if we want, having a tendency to get nearer, or it can be opening up the whole near-far dimension.

523
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:06,000
And he says in Dasein there lies an essential tendency toward closeness.

524
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,119
And that sounds, I want to say, too ontic, too existential.

525
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,520
It sounds like, because I say Marilla-Ponte.

526
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,239
And he sees that.

527
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,480
He writes in the margin a funny thing.

528
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,199
How much closeness?

529
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:20,160
And why?

530
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,680
Being as constant presence has priority making present.

531
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,519
There are two things going on there.

532
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:43,160
One, he's saying that talking about closeness as really reducing the apartness can't be the ontological one because there's no amount of closeness of this ontological tendency.

533
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:46,519
That's because it's opening up the dimension of closeness.

534
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:47,959
And he sees that there's a problem.

535
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:50,200
But then he adds a new problem.

536
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:53,400
And being as constant presence has priority.

537
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:59,879
That means that he's trying to swear.

538
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,520
This is the marginal note written much later.

539
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:14,119
Later, he thinks that there's just being present at all in the space in which it can be near and far or far is the most basic thing.

540
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:19,080
And you shouldn't think of, you shouldn't talk about de-distancing or closeness or anything.

541
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,839
You should talk about presencing.

542
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:28,439
And Dasein has the capacity in interaction with whatever there is that there be presencing.

543
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:35,800
While I'm at it, there's another place where it's fun where he says no on 138.

544
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,520
It's not very often that Heidegger says no.

545
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,000
Oh, by the way, I'll read you two more, and then I've got to stop by.

546
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,879
Stop that.

547
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:51,400
But it's, okay, on 138, about six or seven lines down, he says, the bare space is still bailed over.

548
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,200
And then he says, but space has been split up into places.

549
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,560
And then he writes in the margin, no.

550
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:20,680
I think what that means is that however bare space is covered up, it isn't as if it's the bare space that we operate on when we make things show up and not show up as near and far.

551
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:25,319
I mean, you can't, and that's the way the underlies is so peculiar.

552
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:32,080
I mean, in general, that there's physical space somehow underlies our capacity to experience things near or far.

553
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,999
But we don't give nearness or farness properties to bits of race extensia.

554
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,439
You see what that would be like, saying we give function properties to the present at hand.

555
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,159
So he writes in the margin, no exclamation marks.

556
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:48,559
He sees he blew it on that one.

557
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,520
And now for the presence issue, I'll give you one more funny thing about close.

558
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,919
He's getting all upset about close in the margins.

559
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:10,639
So back to where we were, where that sentence that I sort of threw up my hands in horror on 139, about 10 lines on, decevering amounts to making the farness vanish, that is, making the remoteness of something disappear, bringing it close.

560
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,720
And he writes in the margin, making it present doesn't mean near.

561
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,080
The distance of separation is irrelevant.

562
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,359
So you see what he's doing?

563
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,799
That's the right thing to say.

564
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:29,839
He's saying this dimension of what I'm calling the near-far business can't be getting something nearer or farther.

565
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,440
That's what takes place inside that dimension.

566
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,800
So it isn't a question of getting it closer.

567
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,799
It's a question of opening a space in which you can get further if you want, or closer if you want, or whatever.

568
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:46,960
He sees the problem right at the point where we saw it and fell into it.

569
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,199
And he tries and he gets out of it again in the text when he says, let's look, remember it's an existential.

570
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,199
Okay, I spent much more time on this than I meant to, that I hope I had.

571
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:00,560
And I don't want you to all worry about trying to understand this.

572
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,919
I said I would just fall into a lot of holes to show you where they were, and I'm demonstrating that.

573
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,480
Let's see now, where we are.

574
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,679
Close, oh dear.

575
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,879
Kind of close.

576
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,599
139.

577
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:12,839
We did that, thank goodness.

578
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:21,240
And he admits he mixes up the ontological existential dimension with an onticoexistential one, I claim.

579
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,280
And he tries to straighten it out.

580
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:36,440
And that this is tied up with the sense in which existential space is centered in me and isn't centered in me.

581
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,479
I mean, there's in the sort of ontic space is centered in me.

582
00:53:42,759 --> 00:53:48,920
I'm always in it here, and things are near and far from me here.

583
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,960
They're not just near and far in general.

584
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,320
That's right.

585
00:53:53,319 --> 00:54:03,560
On the other hand, at this ontological level, where Dasein, by its shared familiar activity, is opening up a space in which things can be near and far.

586
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,040
That's not going to be existencial.

587
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:16,040
That space centered in me, seems to me, has to be ontic existential.

588
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:19,639
And at least that's how I want to read it.

589
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,560
I'm looking at 140.

590
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,080
Let's see what I've got here.

591
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,440
Well, I just read that closeness thing, which I'm disagreeing with.

592
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:38,039
And now, okay, I'm not going to say more about that.

593
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:45,639
And I say, when Heidegger starts admitting he's confused, what do you do?

594
00:54:45,639 --> 00:55:00,639
Well, you try to keep your eye on the phenomena, if you care, and describe what it is that's going on, what farness is, what nearness is, how they're related to my being here, how they all presuppose some basic ontological capacity of Dasein.

595
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:02,319
That's what we should look at.

596
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,439
And I summed it up.

597
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,960
There is an ontological existencial condition, which is the condition for the possibility.

598
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,560
Dasein is that.

599
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:22,000
And it's the condition for there being the kinds of near and far that there are, whether they're public or regional or personal.

600
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,479
That's all got to be ontic.

601
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,800
And that's what I've been trying to say.

602
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:34,720
And that is basically, when it's ontic, is about the nearness and farness of things from me here.

603
00:55:35,279 --> 00:55:37,200
Now, let's see.

604
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,279
Okay, next.

605
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:47,520
So, but then things get worse, or I don't think they could get worse, but a new problem arises.

606
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:54,560
You want to be able to explain nearness and farness somehow in terms of the coping capacity of Dasein.

607
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,320
That's what I keep saying, right?

608
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:07,040
That we somehow, because we have this shared familiar coping, can, let's say, release things or free them as far and near.

609
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,719
But it should be, I think, the shared practices.

610
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,239
Familiarity isn't something that you've got or I've got.

611
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:22,240
It goes with the whole way of finding your way around in the world, which we share with other people whose world we share.

612
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:29,359
Familiarity in the room doesn't have to be near or far, and it doesn't have a here and so forth.

613
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:36,959
So he should, I think, try to get nearness and farness to be like the level of familiarity.

614
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,000
But he doesn't.

615
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,759
He relates nearness and farness to the coping or dealing activity of individual Daseins.

616
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:45,959
That keeps happening.

617
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:49,400
He keeps falling back into the closeness thing, into the ontic thing.

618
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:56,599
Now, let me tell you what his problem is, and then how he tries to deal with it.

619
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:57,960
That's the next thing.

620
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,359
So let's get back to it.

621
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,599
This is going to be simpler from now on, thank goodness.

622
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:04,520
We don't have to worry about all that for a minute.

623
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,839
Let's just try to see what he's trying.

624
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,400
Another way to look at what he's trying to do.

625
00:57:10,279 --> 00:57:11,719
What is the problem?

626
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:31,639
One way to think about the problem of nearness and farness that gets it wrong from the ground up, which Heidegger is never going to make this mistake, is to think that we are in what my old teacher, when I first did philosophy, I had a famous philosopher, C.I.

627
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:32,520
Lewis, as my teacher.

628
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:33,719
Anyone ever come across C.I.

629
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:34,760
Lewis anymore?

630
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:38,280
I think he's, unfortunately, justifiably forgotten.

631
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:41,080
He believed the Cartesian story.

632
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,119
He was the last of the kind of Kantians.

633
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:50,920
And he said that the first thing you have to realize is that we're in a here-now predicament, each of us.

634
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:57,880
All we can ever really experience is what's happening here and now in our stream of consciousness.

635
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:10,439
So the question is: how, given that we're this inner stream of nearness and now-ness, how do we ever get out into the world?

636
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,599
It's that old external world story.

637
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:19,639
And Heidegger's trying to say that there isn't any here-now predicament.

638
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:28,559
That when you're Dasein coping in the world, remember that every here is all tied up with a yonder.

639
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,080
That's what I'm leading up to.

640
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,760
That's his next claim.

641
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:41,599
Not only is the world all laid out in terms of near and far, thanks to us, but there is always a here and a yonder thanks to us.

642
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:46,480
And that begins to get him both in the right direction and the wrong direction.

643
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:57,920
He gets him in the right direction in that he's not thinking that we're just in a here-now predicament, that there's already a yonder and a future and a past in our experience.

644
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:06,720
But it gets him into the trying to ask how we as individuals contribute the yonder as well as the here.

645
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:09,359
And that's what he's going to go on about now.

646
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:29,119
So we're going to, not only do we open a spatio-temporal shared world of equipment, which is what he should be talking about, but each of us opens, and this is we're not wrong, there's another phenomenon which he's more on to, which each of us opens his or her own spatial perspective.

647
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:36,639
What he's really discovering is this complicated problem that we are in the world.

648
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,800
We are being in the world.

649
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:41,439
It's not that you're in your world and I'm in my world.

650
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:42,399
That's the I.

651
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,599
Lewis problem and Day Park's problem and the problem of the external world and the problem of other minds.

652
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:58,720
No, Heidegger knows that we're in the world, but we're always in the world from sort of a point of view, a perspective.

653
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:02,559
Because Heidegger says Dasein is its world existingly.

654
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,280
I wanted to make that a paper topic.

655
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,959
CSI's beaten me up because they said it would be too hard, but it's something to worry about.

656
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:22,760
I mean, he says Dasein is being in the world, Heidegger, and he says, I've got a line I quote from way back on 414, whatever it is, Dasein is its world existingly.

657
01:00:22,759 --> 01:00:25,400
And what he's got is now he's got that problem.

658
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:37,240
He's trying to talk about how we are open heads turned toward the world, but from a particular point of view.

659
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:47,560
And you mustn't hear the point of view as particular like in the Renaissance when they were trying to exactly figure out where the perspective on the world is.

660
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,440
That's getting you too much into subjects.

661
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,119
Think of medieval painting.

662
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:59,080
Think of Giotto, who painted things as big or little, depending on how meaningful they were.

663
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,399
There was still a point of view.

664
01:01:02,279 --> 01:01:11,639
He could see that the donkey was nearer than Jesus in this procession or something, but there's a big Jesus and nearer a little donkey.

665
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:17,240
And that's because he wasn't trying to paint geometrical perspective.

666
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:22,040
Heidegger knows that we don't have a geometrical point of view on the world.

667
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,080
That Descartes worked like that, Renaissance way of thinking about it, grew out of it.

668
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:31,960
But we do somehow see the world.

669
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,760
I see you from here and you see me from there.

670
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:42,519
That's the sense in which we have, each of us have our openness on the world.

671
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,719
And that's what he wants to try to get a grip on.

672
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,679
It's so hard that he doesn't get much of a grip on it.

673
01:01:48,680 --> 01:02:02,960
But he wants to talk about the sense in which de-distancing is something that he not he wants to stay away.

674
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,799
I mean, this is what he's getting at right now.

675
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,599
He doesn't want to talk about de-distancing as bringing things close to me.

676
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,199
That's the wrong thing.

677
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,359
That makes it look like my world is prior to the world.

678
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:26,319
What he wants to do is distinguish how we, each of us, experience nearness and farness from us.

679
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,960
And that's all right.

680
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:36,879
Remember, I want to say that's ontic compared to the big question about how we ever open up a world at all.

681
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,159
But now there's a new question.

682
01:02:38,479 --> 01:02:39,759
I hope I haven't lost you.

683
01:02:40,399 --> 01:02:49,199
That it's true that this is nearer me than you guys are, than my car is, and that's nearer to me than my house is.

684
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:51,519
How are we going to talk about that?

685
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,239
And it's all right now.

686
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:57,199
I'm changing the, we're in the new section.

687
01:02:57,199 --> 01:02:59,279
I mean, now he can ask that.

688
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:12,879
He can say that once we've opened up the world into the near, far business, and granted, even that we have a tendency to get nearer to things, what does nearer mean?

689
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,000
What is it to be nearer to something?

690
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,199
Is it being a certain number of feet from something?

691
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:25,439
And if I'm 10 feet from it, I'm nearer to it than if I'm 50 feet from it?

692
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,000
No.

693
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,319
That would be a Cartesian way of thinking.

694
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,359
Well, what is existential nearness?

695
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,879
That's his new question.

696
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,800
What is it to be near or far?

697
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,760
It's a great question.

698
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,960
It's a good question.

699
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,199
It's phenomenologically important.

700
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:44,359
But I think he sort of opens it up and he sort of blows it at the same time.

701
01:03:44,359 --> 01:03:56,040
And what I'm going to try to say in the next five minutes is that he's got something like five different stories about what existential nearness is.

702
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,439
And I'll begin next time by telling you the pages, but it'll help you when you read it.

703
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:16,599
There is accessibility nearness, in which case something that is locked in a box in front of me that I don't have the key is further from me from, say, the microphone drawer over there where I do have the key.

704
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,920
So there's accessibility nearness.

705
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,559
You can find that on 135, but I'll read the passages later.

706
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:34,599
There's the mattering nearness, where my son in LA is nearer to me than lots of people that I barely know.

707
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:40,359
And the more, that's, that is, they really matter to me.

708
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:42,599
And so there's that kind of nearness.

709
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:59,960
Then there's attention nearness, where Heidegger talks about how my glasses are, when they're on my nose and I'm not noticing them, are further from me than whatever it is, the picture I'm looking at in the museum, which is several feet away.

710
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:13,559
So what he's trying to tell you is that existential distance is, or distance is the wrong word, nearness and farness is not measurable in terms of Cartesian distance.

711
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:22,199
Because the same thing is going to be near and far depending on whether you're looking at it as available, accessible, mattering, attention.

712
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:33,199
And then there's something else, the Merleau-Ponty issue about maximum grip, which he also sees, that when I've got a maximal hold on it for manipulation, that's when it's nearest.

713
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:39,199
If it's right up against me and I can't get a grip on it because it's, I don't know, here, that doesn't have, that's not near.

714
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,719
What's near is just when I can face it and hold on to it.

715
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,119
That's another possibility.

716
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,800
Well, oh, look, I've got seven minutes.

717
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,439
I'm going to give you the page numbers, and we will have done this.

718
01:05:49,439 --> 01:05:53,519
So, okay, here goes available near on 135.

719
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:54,960
Don't lose track of the question.

720
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:02,399
I mean, what does nearness mean if it doesn't mean spatial distance, measurable spatial distance?

721
01:06:02,399 --> 01:06:04,639
And that's what he's trying to tell you now.

722
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:17,519
And it's clear that he's got some interesting phenomenological point because all these different existential nearnesses that he plays with, they're all different physical distances.

723
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:25,759
So it can't be that nearness for Dasein means physical distance when it's engaged in its everyday dealing.

724
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:36,879
So, okay, accessibility is on 135, where he's talking about the middle of that big bottom paragraph.

725
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:42,399
To be exact, closeness of equipment has already been intimated in readiness to hand.

726
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:48,399
Every entity that is to hand has a different closeness, which is not ascertainable by measuring distances.

727
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:52,479
This closeness, oh, we're going to find maybe, anyway, never mind.

728
01:06:52,479 --> 01:07:00,800
This closeness regulates in itself, regulates itself in terms of circumspectively quotes calculative, manipulating, and using.

729
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,799
I mean, it isn't really any calculating.

730
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,719
It's just getting a figure, just automatically, practically, getting the best grip.

731
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:17,719
At the same time, what is close in this way gets established by the circumspection of concern with regard to the direction in which the equipment is accessible at the time.

732
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,519
So I'm calling that availability or accessibility nearness.

733
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:29,159
Then there's mattering nearness, on 141, your near and dear people.

734
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:35,000
At the top, German 106.

735
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:42,839
The objective distances of things present at hand do not coincide with the remoteness and closeness of what is ready to hand within the world.

736
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:46,519
Though we may know these distances exactly, this knowledge still remains blind.

737
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:49,799
It does not have the function of discovering and so forth.

738
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:58,040
This knowledge is used only in and for a concernful being which does not measure stretches, being towards the world that matters to one.

739
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:05,800
That's what I'm calling what's near to you is what you care about, or what you're concerned with.

740
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:09,960
He goes over it again on the top of 142.

741
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:19,719
Circumspective concern, five lines down, decides as to the closeness and farness of what is proximately ready to hand environmentally.

742
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:23,319
So now he's decided that it's concern, how much it matters to you.

743
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:27,719
Whatever this concern dwells alongside beforehand is what is closest.

744
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:33,080
So now if I'm concerned about my son in LA, my son turns out to be closest.

745
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,040
So that's another.

746
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,439
I mean, what's a trouble is that these are all contradicting each other.

747
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:40,680
And Heidegger has no way of sorting it out.

748
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,439
I don't know if there is any way of sorting it out.

749
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:45,639
There are a lot of different existential nearnesses and farness.

750
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:54,199
None of them have anything to do with Cartesian feet and miles, but they're all totally different from each other.

751
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:57,000
One that has a closeness will have a farness in another.

752
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:06,399
So this is a funny one, where my glasses turn out to be far away on 141, about 15 lines from the bottom.

753
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:22,239
When, for instance, a man wears a pair of spectacles, which are so close to him distantially, I think that means in real physical space, that they are sitting on his nose, they are environmentally, which is existentially, more remote from him than the picture on the opposite wall.

754
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:30,639
So that means the more you've got, whatever you're paying attention to is what you're nearest to, that one claims.

755
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,319
Now I've got a maximum grip one.

756
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,719
Let's see where that is on 141.

757
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,119
Second paragraph.

758
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:40,479
I'll start at the beginning.

759
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:49,040
When one is primarily and even exclusively oriented toward remoteness as measured distances, the primordial spatiality of being one is concealed.

760
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,159
We're used to that.

761
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:55,040
That which is presumably closest is by no means that which is at the smallest distance from us.

762
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:55,760
That's important.

763
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:05,519
It lies in that which is de-distanced to an average extent when we reach for it, grasp it, or look at it.

764
01:10:05,519 --> 01:10:08,080
So that's what I call the maximum grip kind.

765
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:14,000
The nearest thing is what we are able to reach for and cope with.

766
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,639
Never mind the de-severed or de-distanced in there, because that's the confusing word.

767
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,199
Here it's being what I call ontical.

768
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:27,199
It's not the big ontological dimension of opening up.

769
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,359
Now, let's see where I am.

770
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:32,559
I'm happy to think that I'm just about where I want to be.

771
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,760
I think he's got all kinds of problems.

772
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,960
I'll just say this last.

773
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,519
He's got problems with left and right.

774
01:10:39,519 --> 01:10:41,519
He's got problems with up and down.

775
01:10:41,519 --> 01:10:44,759
He's got problems with anything that involves my body.

776
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,479
Left and right has to be with a body that has the two sides.

777
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:57,319
If I were a completely spherical being, there wouldn't be any left and my head wasn't pointed in one direction, but I don't know, with a big eye straight up or something.

778
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,639
There wouldn't be any distances.

779
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,759
It's of right and there wouldn't be any right and left.

780
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,319
And he doesn't have a way to deal with it.

781
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:12,199
If it wasn't that I was the kind of being that stood upright and so forth, up and down might not make any sense.

782
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:15,159
You might want to think down is the direction things fall.

783
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:24,920
But he's got all these problems because, and this is the last thing I'm going to read, because he thinks he can get along without bringing in the body, which I think he can't.

784
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:33,000
So there's one sentence, I just want to call your attention to it, in which he mentions the body, he then drops it.

785
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:39,319
This is right at the bottom of 108 in the German on 143, just below the middle.

786
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,359
So he says, out of directionality arise the fixed directions of right and left.

787
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:47,399
Dasein constantly takes these directions along with it.

788
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,399
That is true.

789
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:51,719
Whatever right and left is, I take it with me.

790
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,399
Just as it does its distance, distancing.

791
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:57,080
That's confusing, never mind that.

792
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:05,719
Dasein spatializes in its bodily spatialization in its bodily nature is likewise marked out in accordance with these directions.

793
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:10,679
This bodily nature hides a whole problematic of its own, though we shall not deal with it here.

794
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:13,080
That's the body in being in time.

795
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,359
That's the big weakness in being in time, that he hasn't got it.

796
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,719
But I'm not complaining.

797
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:24,359
I mean, he's got so many phenomena already on his plate, so to speak, and he's doing such an amazing, original job of dealing with them.

798
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:26,519
But he makes space for Merleau-Ponty.

799
01:12:26,519 --> 01:12:32,319
That's what Merillau-Ponyonty's whole book, The Phenomenology of Perception, is Heidegger with the body in it.

800
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:33,599
So, well, here's what we are.

801
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,759
I just threw that in.

802
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:42,239
Then now, all we have to do is cover existential space and how it gets turned into physical space.

803
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,239
And I can do that in 15 minutes.

804
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:49,040
So, start reading the Anyone chapter for next time.
