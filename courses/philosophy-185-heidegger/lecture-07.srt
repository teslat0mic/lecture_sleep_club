00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,360
So now, then I want to spend some time before we get to Descartes on something which is sort of exciting to me because I've taught this so often that I less and less find out that I've really made a mistake or put something very unclearly that can be said more clearly and get a chance to think through something new.

2
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:42,081
But I think I can say a lot better than I said in my lecture about something about the relation of the for the sake of which, and at the end of the chain of in order to's, there's a whole clear story to be told.

3
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:50,880
And Heidegger's not very clear about it, and I certainly didn't see the moment in which he sort of makes the important distinction.

4
00:00:50,881 --> 00:01:09,601
My mistake was to treat the whole thing of I'm using the chalk in order to write on the board, in order to finally, for the sake of teaching this course, for instance, I could have said, that's one kind of for the sake of which.

5
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:14,880
And that for the sake of which is something I can achieve and it'll be done by the end of the semester.

6
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:26,400
But all of that, for the, what Heidegger calls primary for the sake of which, of my understanding myself as a teacher, I didn't distinguish the two for the sake of which is clear enough.

7
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:35,360
And the fact that in a certain way, the first one is kind of ontic for the sake of which, I mean, it's about particular relations.

8
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:37,041
I'll explain that more in a minute.

9
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:44,961
But then there is, I think, a difference between an ontic and an ontological for the sake of which, and they aren't even in the same dimension.

10
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:55,641
It isn't as if the ultimate for the sake of which is just one more step after the more relative for the sake of which.

11
00:01:55,641 --> 00:02:19,640
It isn't somehow you teach, I teach the course in order to get you to understand Heidegger, let's say, and I do that in order to be a teacher, because getting you to understand Heidegger, or it's easier if I say teaching 25, teaching philosophy 185 and accomplishing that is something in the future which I'll do, I hope.

12
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:27,320
And then there's this broader thing where I'm being a teacher when I do it, and you're being a student when you do it.

13
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,240
That's not another step.

14
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,721
That's a different level of description.

15
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:33,400
Now, I said it there.

16
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:35,800
Now I'm going to read it the way I wrote it.

17
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:49,400
And I'm going to hand out, well, I'm going to use, I just want to tell you, I'm going to be quoting some long quotations from other places than being in time, and I'm going to hand them all out to you and put them on the website.

18
00:02:49,401 --> 00:03:03,080
And at the same time, I'll put out, put the notes of what I'm going to about say on the website because they're new to me and they've got a whole sort of structure that I would like to emphasize.

19
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Maybe you can write it in your notes in a structure.

20
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,401
Think of two columns.

21
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:14,281
And one of the columns, you can say referential totality, and the other one is significance.

22
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:21,161
I'd write all this on the board, if my writing wasn't so bad in dyslexic that it would take more time to fix it than to write it.

23
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,241
So there are two columns, referential totality and significance.

24
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:33,201
Now, the referential totality, just listen to this now, has two purposes, and they're both for the sake of.

25
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:46,241
The whole structure of inorder to leads up to the, now it goes in the referential totality column, leads up to the for the sake of some basic interest of Dasein.

26
00:03:47,200 --> 00:04:05,920
And on the other hand, there is also the whole activity of coping with the referential totality leads up to a way that a Dasein takes a stand on its being.

27
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,081
Now I have to spell that out more.

28
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,161
So let's look now at all.

29
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:13,681
This is on 116 in very condensed form.

30
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:27,441
This all started because the TAs were sort of, I don't know, the graduate students were sort of challenging me to try to understand better and clearer the distinction between significance and referential totality, which I think Heidegger does not explain very well.

31
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,481
And I was looking afterwards this morning for some nice, clear place where he does explain it.

32
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:40,800
It's sort of running around on page 116, but it's never sort of nailed or hammered, let's say.

33
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,241
So here we go.

34
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,881
So there is something first in the middle roughly of 116.

35
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:55,281
In the German, we're on the top of 184, nor the middle of 184.

36
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:57,361
Sorry, not 184, 84.

37
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,881
So we're on 116.

38
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:00,920
And on the left-hand side.

39
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:10,320
With hammering, I'm just reviewing now, there is an involvement in making something fast, with making something fast.

40
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,521
There is an involvement in protection against bad weather.

41
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,161
This protection is for the sake of providing shelter for Dasein.

42
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,560
That is, for the sake of a possibility of Dasein's being.

43
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,801
That's the crucial phrase.

44
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,681
That's an umvillen in German, a for the sake of.

45
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:44,281
Now, at the very bottom of the page, it turns out that there's something else, the primary towards which is a for the sake of which, and the footnote says that's a vor um villain.

46
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:47,321
So really, there's no big deal difference in the German.

47
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:58,281
One of them just says the for which, or for the sake of, and the other one seems to say for the sake of which, that there's a big deal in what Heyer's trying to do.

48
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:03,961
So, the first one is, I'm going to call it now, put it into the column of referential totality.

49
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,881
It's the pragmatic side.

50
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:21,801
That means the following, that the whole structure of an order twos leads to, as I said, for the sake of a basic interest in DAS of Dasein's, which is now we know this um villain.

51
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:28,121
And this case, the example is, and you could put it on that column, a shelter.

52
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:35,721
And it's, I'd say it's pragmatic because it's not something special with Dasein.

53
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:46,601
As I said when I talked about it before, even beavers can do, can build shelters and have equipmental, a minimal kind of equipmental totality for doing it.

54
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,521
In that sense, I think it's ontic.

55
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:54,841
I mean, if beavers can do it and we can do it, it doesn't seem to have anything especially ontological about it.

56
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:09,120
It's just where this chain of purposes ends, satisfying some need of Dasein or some desire of Dasein, some purpose of Dasein's.

57
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:12,401
It's very just sensible.

58
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:15,521
And now comes the tricky one.

59
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:26,561
And that's starting about ten lines from the end of the big paragraph on the right.

60
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,481
But the totality of involvements itself goes back ultimately towards a towards which in which there is no further involvement.

61
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:35,920
See, that's still ambiguous.

62
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:44,321
There are two towards which is for which there's no further involvement, namely shelter, and now we're going to go to being a shelterer.

63
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,001
And that's both of them are, so to speak, the end of a line.

64
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,680
That's what I wasn't clear about, but they're end of two different lines, so to speak.

65
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,441
They're not all on one line.

66
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,241
So now, so we go back to a towards which in which there's no further involvement.

67
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:00,641
Good, that's true, all right, for both of them.

68
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:05,760
This towards which is not an entity with the kind of being that belongs to what is ready to hand within the world.

69
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:06,641
It's rather an entity.

70
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:11,521
And now he's going to tell you the, he's telling you this whole quote, just so you know.

71
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:14,161
This is not the pragmatic story.

72
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,201
Put this under significance in your column.

73
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,521
This is the existential story.

74
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:23,121
This is not the ontic one, but the ontological one.

75
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,401
So now let me go on.

76
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
It's a being.

77
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:32,641
It's the end of the line in this ontological sense where beavers are not qualified.

78
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:40,081
It is rather an entity whose being is defined as being in the world and whose state of being worldhood itself belongs.

79
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,681
This primary toward which, you can underline that.

80
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,161
I mean, that's the difference between that and the just end of the line towards which.

81
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:57,641
The primary towards which is not just another towards this, as something in which another involvement is possible.

82
00:08:57,641 --> 00:09:04,601
The primary towards which is the for the sake of which, and now we've got this different German word, born villain.

83
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:15,801
But the for the sake of, and the butt's sort of funny, because he's not contradicting it, he's explaining it, the for the sake of always pertains to the being of Dasein.

84
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:32,841
Now, I never noticed, and boy is Heidegger not helping, the difference between a possibility of Dasein's being, that's like being sheltered, something Dasein needs and you can get it, and the being of Dasein.

85
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,521
That's like being a shelterer, that's an identity.

86
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:45,241
Heidegger's making this big distinction with these little moves, these two slightly different German words, these two slightly different formulations.

87
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,321
That's why I missed it all these years.

88
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:58,361
Okay, so the for the sake of what pertains to the being of Dasein, that's in the ontological column, of course, for which in its being that very being is essentially an issue.

89
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:13,800
We've thus indicated the interconnection of the structure of involve how the interconnection by which the structure of an involvement leads to Dasein's very being, the sole authentic for the sake of which.

90
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,440
That hasn't got to do with being authentic or inauthentic.

91
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,441
That's not this kind of moral thing.

92
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:26,441
That means the ultimate for the sake of which, the one that all that, without which, the whole thing wouldn't make any sense.

93
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:30,161
That's at the end of the line there.

94
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:33,680
And that gets me to talking about significance.

95
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Remember, one column is referential totality, that's the ontic one, that's the pragmatic one, and that's the mere for the sake of which.

96
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:55,920
And then there's this other column which gets you to this ultimate, authentic, final for the sake of which, and that's in the column called significance.

97
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,121
Now we can see what the difference between the referential totality or the totality of involvements.

98
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,721
I think those are just sort of two ways of describing the same thing.

99
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,881
The referential totality is the totality of things that bear on other things, that's their involvement.

100
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,561
But there's a big difference between that and significance.

101
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,080
Think about the Bieber again.

102
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,121
I mean, that's only Bieber level connections.

103
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:29,521
And then there's this other level.

104
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:33,920
Why, sort of, ultimately, do we bother to teach?

105
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,640
Do I bother to teach Heidegger or do people bother to make shelters?

106
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:46,560
Beavers bother to make shelters because they're programmed to do it, maybe because they feel too cold and alone if they don't do it.

107
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,001
That's not enough to give this activity a kind of point of a different sort.

108
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:04,320
The point that finally connects it all up with meaning is that you do it because it's the way you take a stand on your being.

109
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:08,320
That's that's that's and significance, just let me say it clearly.

110
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:26,360
The referential totality or the totality of involvement, which is the same thing, becomes, gets described, gets one more interesting characteristic, namely if you add, so how about putting it, I'm trying to put it as clearly as I can.

111
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:40,521
The referential totality already has a kind of pragmatic for the sake of which, which is in a certain way why you're doing it, to teach the course, to make a shelter.

112
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:48,281
But then you add something totally different, why it belongs to the very being of Dasein to be doing it.

113
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,880
And that's up to Dasein, and that's the ultimate for the sake of which.

114
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,001
Now, and that gives the point to the activity.

115
00:12:57,001 --> 00:13:13,480
And significance is the same activity in the same world of stuff described now as always having a point, namely what connects up with Dasein's understanding of itself, its identity.

116
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:18,600
And another way to put the point is, there are two ways you could even put it in a column.

117
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,521
People need shelter, and beavers need shelter, and so forth.

118
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:29,720
The people, and they need this equipmental toll to get that stuff they pragmatically need.

119
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:33,400
The people need to take a stand on their being.

120
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:40,041
And they need all that stuff to satisfy what they existentially need.

121
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:47,480
In Heidegger Jagan, that's what they need to exist, because existing just is taking a stand on your being.

122
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:56,761
Okay, now I've explained that for the first time to me, and to, I hope you all, and I feel happy about that, because I think that really gets something clear.

123
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:57,560
Yeah.

124
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:12,961
It oh, I think I understand your question.

125
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:13,920
I had a little trouble hearing you.

126
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:19,120
There's sort of background noise here, but yes, say it again louder so I can repeat.

127
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,521
I still understand it.

128
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:35,041
Well, let me answer you, I mean, because it seems so interestingly wrong-headed what you're asking.

129
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:42,961
I mean, significance is exactly what you have to add to the referential totality so that you get disclosing of the world.

130
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:49,360
That's important, and that's what you're sort of not saying, because I didn't say it, and it's good to make me say it.

131
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:58,081
It's when you finally get all that up at the ontological level that it doesn't disclose the world of beavers when they make their hutch.

132
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:17,041
But when human beings, all differently, but each one on their own, is doing something that is their stand on their being, that gives you this interconnected world where everything in it has a point or a significance, or not everything, a lot of stuff.

133
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:25,680
I mean, maybe washing your hands doesn't, or brushing your teeth, but I mean, where the where important things show up are disclosed.

134
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:31,201
Well, or there's a space in which things are disclosed, and significant things are discovered.

135
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:32,320
Remember that.

136
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,400
And now I don't know why you brought in the present at hand, but I will see if I can answer that.

137
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,241
Just a second, and then you tell me if I have.

138
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:46,521
Whatever is the space in which things are disclosed, various different modes of being are disclosed.

139
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,281
That's just the way it happens to work.

140
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:58,680
The structure of things is such that in order to have a referential hole, you've got to have two something or others.

141
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:08,761
You've got to have something that has a bunch of properties that make it able to be useful for something, and you have to have a use for it.

142
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:14,440
So there has to be this shank and blob that are hard and can be grasped and wielded around.

143
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:21,880
And there has to be not just hammers, but nails and wood and walls and houses.

144
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,400
And that's the ready-to-hand now.

145
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:35,080
So there has to be the present-at-hand stuff with its properties, which in a certain sense underlies the ready-to-hand.

146
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,761
We talked about that already.

147
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:42,840
And the causal properties that make possible its use.

148
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,601
And then there's the use.

149
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,360
Now, I don't, so now why do you say the things you say?

150
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,440
Because maybe.

151
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:10,600
Ah, well, that's not the way Heidegger uses the term.

152
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:20,680
I mean, there's plenty of causal holism in the way the stuff out of which hammers are made is related to the stuff out of which other things are made.

153
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:26,041
But try to referential is not very helpful, but maybe bearing is better.

154
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,360
Hammers have a bearing on nails.

155
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,721
There's no, that's not present at hand.

156
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:34,800
Science has no place for the bearing of hammers on nails.

157
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,560
That is, that doesn't affect science that if you had a culture in which everything was tied to vines, there wouldn't be anything like hammers.

158
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,560
That's all already at the meaning level.

159
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:54,640
I think, and you're pushing me to say something that I find sort of messes up my picture a little.

160
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:06,080
It looks like you only need the referential totality to have ready-to-hand and present-at-hand revealed, disclosed.

161
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,920
I can't make a case.

162
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:12,881
Here's a puzzle for you who are sophisticated enough on this already.

163
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,121
Most of you, I think it's too hard.

164
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,521
I think I don't know the answer.

165
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:34,320
Why is it that the disclosive space in which the ready-to-hand and the present at hand, in which equipment, both in its ready-to-hand and present-at-hand aspects, go up, why does that disclosive space require significance?

166
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Why isn't it enough that it just be a referential whole?

167
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,360
Which is really the tough question.

168
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:45,281
Don't beavers also have present at hand and ready-to-hand?

169
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:48,641
They probably have ready-to-hand, but not present-at-hand.

170
00:18:48,961 --> 00:19:00,960
I take it beavers don't stare at substances and study their properties, but they certainly, I think, use mud and all the stuff that whatever beavers use transparently.

171
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:04,720
And I think its way of being ought to be ready to hand.

172
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:11,840
But so now I'm really confused about something, which I try to not confuse you about, but just state as a clear question.

173
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:34,120
Somehow, the holism of the referential whole, the whole of involvements, which is very much the same, and significance all give you worldhood, which is the disclosure space in which anything with any kind of being gets discovered.

174
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:45,880
Why do we need, this is my question, this being that takes a stand on its being at the end of the line to give us worldhood.

175
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,360
We better understand that because that must be very important to Heidegger.

176
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,521
I mean, that's what does separate Dasein from beavers, and I think that must be extremely important.

177
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,480
David, can you help?

178
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:57,720
Yeah.

179
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,881
Well, that's been ultimately important.

180
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:08,840
Functionally as the conditions for any other sector, there would be no other meaning.

181
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:13,241
Why are you in the course lecturing and so forth?

182
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,120
Heidegger, why are we taking Heidegger and so forth?

183
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,361
Old thing comes down to become an issue for us, a question for us.

184
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:26,920
That's the ultimate concept in which we're sitting.

185
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,920
Well, you're you.

186
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,080
Okay, well, that's exactly what Heidegger thinks.

187
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,080
But I'm asking, I'm questioning it.

188
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,640
I mean, I want to know why Heidegger thinks that.

189
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,200
Why doesn't Heidegger just think as soon as you've got a referential whole, you've got already tables and chairs and so forth?

190
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:51,241
Why do I have to be here taking a stand on my being as a teacher?

191
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:54,041
Why can't I just be earning my salary as a professor?

192
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,041
And all this equipment will still show up for me.

193
00:20:56,761 --> 00:21:03,281
Okay, that's the way Dasein is.

194
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:08,161
Okay, well, then I see why you're saying it your way.

195
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:22,080
So Heidegger may not have an argument that you need the referential, the significance level in order to have an organized world of equipment.

196
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:30,640
But in fact, we do have the significance level, and it goes into the referential hole of significance.

197
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:38,001
I can't help feeling that there's something deeper going on, that you can't disclose a world if you don't have that.

198
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:43,600
And where I can't doesn't mean you just don't disclose a world unless you're taking a stand on your own being.

199
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:56,080
That there's some deep connection between taking a stand on your own being and significance, and some deep connection between significance and disclosing a world that just a referential hole won't get.

200
00:21:56,721 --> 00:22:01,120
I mean, it would be nice to see that, because I think Heidegger sees it, but I don't see it.

201
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,560
Yeah, Curtis.

202
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,681
Dasein is its world existingly, yeah.

203
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:12,640
Yes.

204
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,320
Yes.

205
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:25,041
Well, you guys are all good Heideggerians in a way, but you're stuck in the circle.

206
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:35,201
I mean, you just said that Dasein is the being that takes a stand on its being, and lo and behold, that's how come there's a world showing up.

207
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,121
I mean, yes, Dasein is its world existingly.

208
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:47,640
That means it's Dasein takes a stand on its being, and lo and behold, there's a world disclosing things.

209
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,400
Really?

210
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,240
What do you mean by Dasein is declaring?

211
00:22:57,241 --> 00:23:01,560
Well, okay, you'll have to explain that to me later when we get to understanding.

212
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,761
I don't see it.

213
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:06,920
I don't see how it works.

214
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:10,120
And I bet something important is in there.

215
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,560
Well, come and tell me about it in office hours or wherever.

216
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,360
Yeah.

217
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:25,800
This may be too much of a stress, but in an effort to escape the kind of zone terminology, I find myself reminded of Williams' idea of integrity regarding all this.

218
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:35,400
And the idea, for example, just hold it for the second witch, that you have your project and commitments, but it's not the project and commitments themselves that matter as much as that you have them.

219
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,521
And that people become a good person by having them, that it's important to have them.

220
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:48,041
And this sense in which everything else must be understood in the context of that, that you just have this integrity, but segmented your character.

221
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,480
Well, that's nothing you're talking about, William James, I take it.

222
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:52,041
What James?

223
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,761
I mean, Williams, Bernard Williams.

224
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:56,761
Ah, Bernard Williams.

225
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,521
The man who was here used to be here.

226
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:02,840
Well, you don't know that because he died two years ago.

227
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,560
But anyway, so why do you say you said Williams?

228
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,120
Yes.

229
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:16,200
Just try and defend this whole thing for the sake of which from a, I guess, more personal standpoint, try and make it seem less abstract.

230
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:24,120
In the sense that the reason it's important, I think, is because, oh my goodness.

231
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:39,840
Something like it has to be this whole world of all these connections just wouldn't be there and wouldn't hang together if we weren't the kind of beings who have this kind of integrity or identity which we need to take a stand.

232
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,600
That all this stuff is here.

233
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,720
See, this is the because I can't really understand yet.

234
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:50,400
All of this stuff is here because we're the kind of being that needs to take a stand on its being.

235
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,640
That's the what's that's what it's Heidegger says that, and I'm sure it's right, and I'm sure there's more to say about it, but we haven't got it yet.

236
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:17,120
Yeah, we are very much creating a development, only virtual world possibilities.

237
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:38,721
But I wonder about you, actually, actually developing one going working instead of the other half as being most people all over the world or in the West, or I mean, I'm just wondering whether you're making a, which point you're making, that this is only for us because we're this kind of self-choosing culture.

238
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:48,241
If so, I disagree with you completely, if that's because you mistaking, and it's Heidegger's fault, choosing your stand on your being with having a stand on your being.

239
00:25:48,241 --> 00:26:01,920
In other cultures, you grow up as the medicine man because your father was, and you're always in the chain of being medicine men, and other people grow up as workers and the mothers and weavers and whatever.

240
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:06,640
And they never take a stand on their being consciously, but they have it.

241
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,120
And it organizes what equipment they deal with and what it means to them.

242
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:24,521
And now you may be saying, also, even in our West world, lots of people don't ever face up to choosing, and again, choosing is the misleading thing, a stand on a being.

243
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:31,400
But if Heidegger's right, they are Dasein, and they're not being in a world, and they don't disclose unless they do it.

244
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Everybody, the end of the line, is that being for which being is an issue.

245
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:54,201
And we are all those beings, and every culture, and so far as Heidegger's got it right about what it is to have a world, everyone, everyone that isn't a wolf child or a sort of catatonic has it.

246
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:55,241
Yeah.

247
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,800
They're not exclusively, it's not conscious.

248
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,120
It isn't like people think these guys are being nice and saying, How is it any different?

249
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,120
The being of the term is culture.

250
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:08,600
Ah, big, good question.

251
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,080
You see, podcast people, you should be here.

252
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,920
This is an interesting discussion.

253
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:15,080
And people are making progress.

254
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Anyway, I think the answer to that is: one, we don't want to say it's unconscious.

255
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:28,680
That would suggest that there is some sort of explicit choice being made, only it's just not, that they just don't know it.

256
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,041
It's not like that.

257
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:36,041
You look at people's behavior and you interpret it as more like a therapist might.

258
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:43,160
But well, that only will bring back the unconscious, a good therapist, a therapist who doesn't believe in the unconscious, my kind of therapist.

259
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:53,320
Anyway, that kind of therapist, I would say, knows that they're interpreting the behavior of the person, and they're watching and they're seeing, for instance, let's go back to the sacrificial mother.

260
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,440
What do they see?

261
00:27:54,441 --> 00:28:05,360
Well, they see what she does with her children and her husband and her job, and they see what choices she makes and how it's always the children causing her to do to give up other things.

262
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:18,480
Now that doesn't mean that she's consciously decided to be a sacrificial mother and it's sort of misleading to say unconsciously decided as if someone in the other part of her brain has decided it just wasn't something she had access to.

263
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:30,721
She just grows up with a style of behavior which somebody with sensitivity in that kind of training, observing it, sees that that's really her identity.

264
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:32,640
That's what really matters to her.

265
00:28:33,041 --> 00:29:04,160
So and that's in that, if you keep putting it that way, you can then, because you need to, because you've got to be able to see why Heidegger thinks that everybody, even the most sort of lazy people or the most conformist people or the most primitive people in some other culture, if you observe their behavior, you'll see that there's some way that they are that something crucial is in there, something for which they will sort of give up everything else if they have to.

266
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,680
But that was helpful, yeah.

267
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,881
Ah, well, those are all good questions.

268
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:36,161
I think the nature of an interpretation in Heidegger fancy talk hermeneutic investigation is that you make an interpretation, you try to see if you if all the details fit in, if crucial details that are obviously important to the person don't fit in, then you've got to give up that interpretation and get a better one.

269
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,681
And that's how it works.

270
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,080
The same way it works with reading Being in Time.

271
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
You come up with an interpretation.

272
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,481
That's hermeneutic too.

273
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:48,041
Everything all intr all over the place in Heidegger, there's Herman, that's interpretation that's going on.

274
00:29:48,361 --> 00:30:07,000
In Heidegger, you look at the text, you try to make sense of it, you say, I see this is the phenomenon he's talking about, and you describe that, and you go back and you look at the text, and that seems to make sense for a while, and then some important sentence comes along that shows you that wasn't right, and you have to try again, and you never know you've got the answer.

275
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:09,640
It's interesting that Heidegger is so consistent.

276
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,880
Did I read you the passage from Basic Problems where Heidegger says that he knows that he may not, he knows that he hasn't got it.

277
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:18,441
In some crucial way, he hasn't got it right.

278
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:22,921
And he knows that because it's an interpretation that he's giving.

279
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:33,881
An interpretation is always in a horizon, that is, a context, a background of what you're taking for granted as familiar.

280
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:42,281
And there's always, Heidegger thinks, a broader context in which your context, which you thought was everything, turns out not to be.

281
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,681
So your interpretation, you never come to the final interpretation.

282
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,521
Sometimes Heidegger thinks, in being basic problems, that's what he thinks.

283
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,880
In being in time, he seems to think that when you get to temporality, you really get to the ultimate interpretation.

284
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:00,760
I think Heidegger is deeply ambivalent about that.

285
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,240
But that's, we don't need to go into that.

286
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,920
Let's go back to the main line.

287
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:05,481
Yeah.

288
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,440
Good, good.

289
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:19,080
So a question: does disclosing a world mean disclosing it as a world?

290
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,120
That is, you realize that you're disclosing a world and that the world is what you're disclosing.

291
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,400
No, you don't have to do that.

292
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:34,881
Always test this against the black forest peasants who are Heidegger's favorite form of human being.

293
00:31:34,881 --> 00:31:39,841
And presumably they haven't a clue about world disclosing.

294
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:46,560
That doesn't mean that there isn't a world open to them in which objects are showing up as present in hand and ready to hand.

295
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:49,441
And okay.

296
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:49,840
Yeah.

297
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:54,641
When you're letting, let me, before you go talking again, let's hear from Tyler back there.

298
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:56,881
Can you talk real loud?

299
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,440
One of them from the basic reference of all from significance.

300
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:07,840
Good.

301
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:21,280
That just seems like, so far, just words.

302
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,560
And what's the phenomena that he's asking us to look at?

303
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:27,521
Whoa, some big noise is coming.

304
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:40,640
I think being toward the world, I have trouble hearing you, but I think people should.

305
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:45,121
Heidegger does say being towards the world, but I think it's very misleading.

306
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,360
I can't, I mean, give me the page references because that sounds so wrong to me.

307
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:10,480
That there could be a being towards the world for a being that is always already in the world seems to me crazy.

308
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:20,041
I mean, the crucial thing about Dasein is they're never you're never outside the world, you're never related to the world, there's too much in in it, like a goldfish in water.

309
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,121
The goldfish isn't towards the water.

310
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:28,041
I mean, how could you be how could you be towards the world when you are the world existingly?

311
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,441
So you have to see the passages.

312
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:56,280
Well, that's just to say, it seems to me, what you just said seems to me right, but that seems that's to repeat the point.

313
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:09,080
Yes, somehow or other, there has to be something, namely, taking a stand on your being, which has to be in there, otherwise you wouldn't be being in the world.

314
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,641
In fact, this very sentence says that, doesn't it?

315
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:22,521
Or some sentence lately, just about the prime, for the sake of the being of Dasein Chung says, no, not that sentence.

316
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:24,921
But anyway, we know Dasein is being in the world.

317
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:28,600
And we know that being in the world requires taking a stand on your being.

318
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,881
So that's fine.

319
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:50,761
The question is, and we know you're always already in the world, and you're always already in the world the way that human beings are in the world, namely it's serving you as an equipment, practically, the world and the referential totality, to do something, which is your stand on your being.

320
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:55,560
And that's what Heidegger says.

321
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,760
That's the phenomenon.

322
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,321
I agree with that, but I don't see yet that that's that nothing I want to say denies that.

323
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:06,560
I just don't see, and maybe there's no need to say anything more.

324
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,921
Maybe my problem is to ask for something more.

325
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:12,320
Anyway, I can't handle that more.

326
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,680
So now I have one more hand up.

327
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,761
You wanted to come, well, no, you, okay.

328
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,560
Yes.

329
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:32,001
And I'm wondering if the women that are thinking of sacrificial mother would think of themselves in general.

330
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:40,881
And then we will, if you need more appropriate history, how do you validate it?

331
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,001
Wow.

332
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:42,801
Wow.

333
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:50,560
That's a good, important question, but it's a kind of, you know, it's a therapy kind of question, not really for us to think about.

334
00:35:50,560 --> 00:36:11,680
On my website, if you want to follow it up, there's a paper called Two Alternative Conceptions of Psychotherapy, in which the one is that there's some unconscious stuff, facts, beliefs, memories that you should get out of your unconscious, and the other is the unconscious really is, is the background.

335
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,881
It's the water area.

336
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:14,720
And that's what you're saying.

337
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,400
I mean, the sacrificial mother, of course she doesn't know she's a sacrificial mother.

338
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:22,721
It's not a truth that she is sort of repressing.

339
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:26,001
It's so pervasive she can't see it.

340
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:28,001
So what can the therapist do?

341
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:43,680
Well, the therapist has got to gradually get her to see that what she takes as the obvious truth about reality is her interpretation, and it's getting her in trouble.

342
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:55,160
But that's a hard thing to do, and Tran, for instance, has got to play a role in it, because she's going to be relating to the therapist in a way that she can grab something that isn't her usual way.

343
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,881
But anyway, I don't want to go into it more, but your question is a good one.

344
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:08,600
The last, I mean, the sacrificial mother does not know that she's a sacrificial mother, and probably whatever I'm doing when I keep saying I'm a teacher is something that I don't really know.

345
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,681
Well, I can use this to make a point.

346
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:20,920
It isn't as if, and I just talk this way because it's simpler, that I've got my for the sake of which it's being a teacher, the guy building the house has got his for the sake of which it's being a shelterer.

347
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:23,080
You know, it's much more specific than that.

348
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:33,240
I'm just not any old teacher, but a teacher with a certain style, teaching at a certain stage in the history of the world, teaching in a whole academic system, teaching Heidegger.

349
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,401
I mean, it's very, very specific, my for the sake of which.

350
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:42,681
It's sort of my identity, and my identity isn't some very general role.

351
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,401
But you can sort of point at it that way.

352
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:49,560
And of course, the sacrificial mother will have her own very special way.

353
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:59,161
And you can think of that as an atmosphere that will color everything that I experience or she experiences or you experience.

354
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,080
And okay, now I think we should go on.

355
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:06,920
That's all fascinating.

356
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:14,201
And I knew that I had gotten into some new territory, which is what we went out to do every once in a while.

357
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:21,241
Now, oddly enough, I have a quote that I was going to read next.

358
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:24,600
We're talking about worldhood.

359
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:30,041
We're talking about significance, referential totality plus significance equals worldhood.

360
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,961
And worldhood is this disclosive space in which we encounter everything.

361
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:43,281
And it's come up sort of in passing every, and we know that worldhood is more basic than intentionality.

362
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,321
That worldhood is what makes intentionality possible.

363
00:38:46,321 --> 00:39:02,001
It's not intentionality, that is, our beliefs and our desires and stuff that relate us as a mind to the world, or that makes the worldhood possible.

364
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:08,481
It's because there is this disclosure space that I can have beliefs, I can perceive things, I can desire things.

365
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:12,881
Well, now, I just want to add one more thing, because I just came across an amazing quote.

366
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:15,360
I knew it once before, but I lost it.

367
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,441
Now I find it again.

368
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,760
I just want to add that not only, this is really mind-boggling, and that's why it's interesting.

369
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:39,441
Now, Heidegger thinks not only does the worldhood of the world, or the phenomenon of the world, whichever, make intentionality, that is, the relation of the mind and world to the world, possible, he thinks it makes consciousness possible.

370
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:49,841
I say this because people constantly sort of bring in conscious and unconscious when they think about this, and that's really just not interesting to Heidegger.

371
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:57,840
And I say it too because those of you who are philosophy majors, and most of you are, know that consciousness is a hot subject right now.

372
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:04,481
There are meetings all the time all over the world and books and anthologies of people writing about consciousness.

373
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:07,920
I think, and they all say there's a very big problem, and it sure is.

374
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:16,441
I think nobody has a clue as to what it is or how to talk about it or how it's related to the brain, but Heidegger has an interesting spin on this.

375
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,921
His answer would be: well, then don't talk about it.

376
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:19,560
Don't worry about it.

377
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:20,841
It's not important anyway.

378
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:29,401
And I'll just read you the quote where he says that, and I'll print it on the next thing I hand out because it's in a very obscure place.

379
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:38,760
It's in a little book called Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre, edited or put together by Walter Kaufman.

380
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,440
It's translated from something Heidegger wrote called The Way Back into the Ground of Metaphysics.

381
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,640
Don't worry about all that.

382
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
I put that on when I give you the quote.

383
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:56,600
Here's the quote: The existential nature of man is the reason why man can represent things as such and why he can be conscious of them.

384
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,280
All consciousness presupposes existence as the essence of man.

385
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,200
He's saying man instead of Dasein this time.

386
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,641
He sometimes says that.

387
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,241
So all kinds, I'll just put in Dasein better anyway, that way.

388
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,720
So let's go back to that, starting over.

389
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:21,241
The existential nature of Dasein is the reason why Dasein can represent beings as such and why Dasein can be conscious of them.

390
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,320
All consciousness presupposes existence as the essence of Dasein.

391
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:27,560
You recognize being in time.

392
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,001
Consciousness does not itself create the openness of beings.

393
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:33,001
That's the disclosing of the world.

394
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:38,121
Nor is it consciousness that makes it possible for man to stand open for beings.

395
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,400
That's the same point.

396
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:50,121
Whither and whence and in what free dimension could the intentionality of consciousness move if being in the world were not the essence of man in the first place.

397
00:41:50,361 --> 00:42:04,721
So Heidegger's notion is the kind of coping, the kind of absorbed coping we do at the most basic level, where we don't even have to be conscious, already, and we do that with the referential totality of significance.

398
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:12,480
That basic level, which is the level of the world and of disclosing, is prior to consciousness.

399
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:14,080
It doesn't need consciousness.

400
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,001
That's an amazing claim.

401
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:17,520
I mean, I think it's right.

402
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:20,480
Nietzsche had a similar story to tell.

403
00:42:20,881 --> 00:42:31,921
But it certainly seems like a sort of odd thing to spend so much time on it as if, but everybody believes it, because you're all Cartesians at heart, me too.

404
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:36,560
I mean, it looks like if you're not conscious, well, then there isn't any world, there isn't any referential totality.

405
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,400
How can you disclose any objects?

406
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,001
Got to be conscious, otherwise you're just in a stupor.

407
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,361
You're a zombie.

408
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:47,761
John Searle says, I hold, and that Heidegger holds.

409
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,600
But you're not a sleep-walking zombie.

410
00:42:51,600 --> 00:43:04,641
You're coping very, what, with great skill and flexibility and expertise with the door and the doorknob and the chairs and the English languages you carry on a conversation.

411
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:12,080
And you can do it without being in any, I mean, consciousness is such a weasly word.

412
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,201
You can certainly do it without noticing what you're doing.

413
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:22,080
You can do it in such an absorbed way that you are just not aware of what you're doing.

414
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,680
But you do it very well anyway.

415
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,600
And then you can later reflect on it.

416
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,641
And of course, one more thing I want to say: Heidegger doesn't think that means that you're never conscious.

417
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:42,001
He just thinks that at the very rock bottom, most finding your way around in the world, as Dewey says, sort of getting on and off the bus and dressing yourself, you can do that without being conscious of what you're doing.

418
00:43:42,001 --> 00:43:44,721
Anyway, so interesting quote, I think.

419
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:49,560
Now, let's go on to where we are, the critique of Descartes.

420
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,361
Luckily, we have another whole session, so I'm not worried.

421
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,600
But I want to read one thing.

422
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,520
Sometimes, and I'm still in a kind of getting everything located in my head in a way.

423
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:09,080
I mean, I know that Heidegger has a big influence on people who take this course.

424
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,681
And they say it changes their life and it changes their way of looking at things.

425
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,161
And I must say, like the sacrificial mother, I'm so inside it that I don't really understand what they're talking about.

426
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:29,641
So, but every once in a while, I read somebody who clearly and simply sort of says why Heidegger is so important to the West and to them and to us.

427
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,440
And this is Mark Rathol in his introduction to the How to Read Heidegger book.

428
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:37,640
And it fits in right here with the Cartesian chapter.

429
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,560
That's why I'm reading it now.

430
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,080
It's very simple.

431
00:44:41,080 --> 00:45:01,801
He says, the bottom of page five: Heidegger did more than any other thinker of the 20th century to develop a coherent way of thinking and talking about human existence without reducing it to a natural scientific phenomenon on the one hand or treating it as a ghostly mind haunting the physical world on the other.

432
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:09,240
This has inspired artists and social scientists who have struggled to acknowledge the dignity and freedom of human existence.

433
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:15,801
It is the inspired scientists who have tried to keep mindful of the limits of scientific inquiry.

434
00:45:15,801 --> 00:45:25,001
And it has challenged us all to rethink our place in history and the direction in which we as a scientific and technological culture are moving.

435
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:31,600
I think that's a neat summing up of why Heidegger's interesting.

436
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:33,360
You have to put a hand up?

437
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:33,681
No.

438
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:44,721
And it brings to focus on the question of naturalism and of cognitivism, which is what I'm going to talk about from today and the next time.

439
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,961
Naturalism is the view that we will eventually understand everything in terms of physics and chemistry.

440
00:45:50,961 --> 00:46:06,080
And there are these people who are worrying and worrying about how we're going to understand consciousness in terms of brain activity, since consciousness seems to be this kind of first-person awareness and brain activity just seems to be neurons that bumping into each other.

441
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,080
And so naturalism is a big issue, and Heidegger's an anti-naturalist.

442
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,080
And cognitivism is a big issue.

443
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,961
That's the ghostly mind story.

444
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:19,121
That's John Searle kind of story.

445
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:27,281
There's always got to be consciousness and meaning and intentionality, which besides the brute facts of science.

446
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:35,841
And then you get the question: well, can you, in the end, reduce the consciousness and this intentionality to the brute facts of science?

447
00:46:35,841 --> 00:46:44,560
Or are you going to be a dualist about it and say, well, there are these two deeply different ways of being, and you can't reduce one to the other?

448
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,401
Those are all big issues that people are writing and thinking and having meetings and teaching courses about.

449
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:53,921
And Heidegger's got an important, interesting view.

450
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:58,321
So I'm going to sum up his view in three slogans.

451
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:10,961
Naturalism is impossible, meaning we can't get a meaningful world from the brute facts of physics.

452
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:20,840
Brute facts is Searle's way of talking about it, and I think it's very helpful, Searle is an interesting character who worries about this issue.

453
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:24,521
So naturalism is impossible, Heidegger thinks.

454
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:27,241
Cartesianism is impossible.

455
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:37,400
Cartesianism says, well, of course, you can't expect to get the meaning and mental stuff out of physical things.

456
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:39,480
Why would you think so?

457
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:45,721
You've got to throw in, that's what I said earlier a minute ago, you've got to throw in mind, this invisible super stuff.

458
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:54,121
And only because there are minds in the world, as well as all this physical stuff, do we get a meaningful world?

459
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:07,961
Now, Heidegger thinks that kind of dualism, which is Descartes, build a meaningful whole somehow out of physics, out of the physical and the mental.

460
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:10,201
That's impossible.

461
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:28,441
And he further thinks that something like artificial intelligence or more generally cognitivism, which is a kind of funny form of Cartesianism, I'll explain when I get there, won't work.

462
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:40,921
That is, you can't use mental elements to make a representation of the world in the mind and then generate behavior on the basis of that.

463
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:54,121
Those of you who know about cognitivism and AI will recognize that that's sort of the general feature of what John Hoagland, a former student from here, calls good old-fashioned AI.

464
00:48:54,401 --> 00:49:01,521
But the crucial issue there is whether you have to have an inner representation of the external world.

465
00:49:01,841 --> 00:49:03,840
Okay, I'm not going to get to that today.

466
00:48:59,961 --> 00:49:06,720
So let's start with the anti-naturalism.

467
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:16,721
Heidegger wants to show the contrast between his ontological understanding of the world and traditional ontology.

468
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:26,640
Traditional ontology starts with this root stuff, nature, and then asks, and what else do we have to add on to get our world?

469
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,041
And different people have different views about it.

470
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:36,161
But Heidegger is saying that whole way of asking the question is wrong.

471
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:45,761
What's basic is the holistic coping, which opens up the world by beings like us who are already in it.

472
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:59,600
And that's more basic than perceiving and thinking and looking at the present at hand.

473
00:49:59,841 --> 00:50:02,240
But I give you some quotes to show you.

474
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:09,041
I mean, he's turning around a kind of naturalism that says that what's basic is the natural world and the present at hand.

475
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:12,321
And he's saying, no, no, that's not right.

476
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:20,961
Okay, he does all this very well in the fundamental, in the, what is it, the something history of time.

477
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:30,161
History of the concept of time, which I keep talking about because it's very, remember it's the lectures the year before being in time.

478
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:39,600
So at the bottom of 164, he says, letting something be seen as possible on the basis of, where are we?

479
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,080
On the basis of letting something be encountered.

480
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,280
And this is possible only on the basis of always already being involved with.

481
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:56,201
Only an entity which in its being has the aptitude to let another entity be encountered stands in the possibility of apprehending something of knowledge.

482
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,321
Knowing is nothing but a mode of being in the world.

483
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:03,640
Specifically, it's not even a primary, but a founded way of being in the world.

484
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,641
That's what I wanted to get to.

485
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:18,201
I mean, so the whole attitude of knowing, which is the traditional way that we're supposed to be related to nature, isn't going to be for him basic.

486
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,201
It's, or he says, but you can see why I like this.

487
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,360
Knowing is nothing but a mode of being in the world.

488
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:28,600
Specifically, it's not even a primary, but a founded way of being in the world.

489
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:35,321
A way which is always possible only on the basis of non-cognitive comportment.

490
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:48,041
I mean, I like that because he's saying that the whole world where we are the whole way of thinking about things as minds looking at objects only makes sense on the background.

491
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,881
It's the usual point of absorption.

492
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,961
Knowing your way around.

493
00:51:51,961 --> 00:51:53,640
I don't know now why I read that.

494
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,080
I mean, except I like it.

495
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,001
I don't see that it helps very much for the discussion right now.

496
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,800
But here I'm going to go on where I am.

497
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:07,320
When saying knowledge is a founded mode, Heidegger's saying that it is not what's most basic.

498
00:52:07,321 --> 00:52:13,321
What's most basic are the coping skills that add up to familiarity and open a world.

499
00:52:13,321 --> 00:52:22,120
And on the basis of that, we can then have theory and we can have practice, relate to particular things.

500
00:52:22,441 --> 00:52:26,760
And Heidegger, and Descartes is just the opposite.

501
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:37,521
That's why I want to get that out, because Descartes says it's on the basis of the stuff in the world that we have to do our ontology.

502
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:53,520
And Heidegger's talking about this on 122, page 89 at the top, in the middle of that first paragraph, the paragraph, a contrast between our analysis of worldhood and Descartes' interpretation of worldhood.

503
00:52:53,841 --> 00:53:00,961
He says, we shall accordingly try to clarify his approach, that is, this approach, ontologically.

504
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,441
No, no, no, that's the wrong approach.

505
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:04,001
I'm sorry.

506
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:07,921
He's going to try to clarify Descartes' approach.

507
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,800
This whole paragraph is setting up how Descartes does it.

508
00:53:20,801 --> 00:53:23,681
So maybe I should begin at the beginning of section B.

509
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:34,801
Only step by step, and you have to remember this is not Heidegger, can the concept of worldhood and the structures which this phenomenon embraces be firmly secured in the course of our investigation?

510
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:39,761
The interpretation of the world begins in the first instance with some entity within the world.

511
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,000
You can see that that can't be Heidegger, unless he was beginning with this entity.

512
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:46,401
But I mean, any old entity within the world.

513
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:50,000
So that the phenomena of the world in general no longer comes into view.

514
00:53:50,001 --> 00:53:57,841
That is, you just pay attention to things, stuff, brute facts, and you lose track that there is a world at all.

515
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:04,801
You could pay attention to the universe, because the universe is just a bunch of facts, but you lose the way, the referential whole and all that.

516
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:08,801
So he said, so now he's going to talk about that.

517
00:54:08,801 --> 00:54:21,001
We shall accordingly try to clarify this view, clarify this approach ontologically by considering what is perhaps the most extreme form in which it's been carried out.

518
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:32,121
We not only shall present briefly the basic features of Descartes' ontology of the quotes world, because Descartes doesn't really know that there's a Heidegger kind of world.

519
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,201
Remember, the quotes world is the universe, it's the totality of facts.

520
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:51,080
We not only shall present briefly the basic features of Descartes' ontology of the world, but shall inquire into its presuppositions and characterize these in the light of what we've hitherto achieved.

521
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:56,761
So he's going to sort of test Descartes against his phenomenology.

522
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,961
And he says it again on 199.

523
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,400
Again, I think well.

524
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:06,840
I was having a feeling, boy, oh boy, the things are good in this book.

525
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,760
And maybe I've got carried away.

526
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:18,440
But on 199, he says, worldhood cannot be read off from nature.

527
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:27,080
The environmental references in which nature is present primarily in a worldly way tell us rather the reverse.

528
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:32,120
Nature as a reality can only be understood on the basis of worldhood.

529
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,320
Remember, not explain.

530
00:55:33,321 --> 00:55:41,800
Heidegger's always got in the background, a distinction between explaining things, like why this lecture and holds the papers up.

531
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:43,481
That's science's job.

532
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:47,881
And understanding things, which is understanding the significance of them.

533
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:54,201
So he wants to say: nature can only be understood on the basis of worldhood.

534
00:55:54,200 --> 00:56:02,560
The entity of relationships of dependence of worldly entities among themselves do not coincide with the founding relationships in being.

535
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:14,480
That is, what founding relationships are relationships of what makes sense of what, whereas causal relationships explain what causes what.

536
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:42,560
And so, and now, another way to put what he's trying to set up here is that he wants you to see that the nature is what you've got left when intelligibility, that is, significance and everything that makes sense of our way of being, is left out.

537
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:53,041
Then you get this very reduced and thinned-out bunch of facts that are present at hand, with meaningless present-at-hand properties.

538
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:10,800
And his claim is you can't explain this world, the in order to, towards which, and obviously the for the sake of which, and significance, you can't explain that if all you've got to go on, you can't understand it or explain it.

539
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,001
Which do I mean?

540
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:14,321
I underly explained.

541
00:57:17,841 --> 00:57:19,921
Well, hmm.

542
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:39,121
The people who want to explain all this mean they want to take these minimal facts and then add them up to somehow show that you could start with these brute facts and you end up with a world.

543
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:43,440
And remember now, this is not Descartes, really.

544
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,641
This is naturalism.

545
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,961
Descartes' going to say, Yeah, I know you can't do that, but you have to throw in mine.

546
00:57:49,961 --> 00:58:05,001
But right now, he's just telling you that a lot is left out when you try to do any kind of explanation or understanding.

547
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:13,881
I'm not being clear because Heidegger's not doing what I'm not quite in sync with what Heidegger's doing.

548
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:33,401
Heidegger thinks naturalism is just the business of trying to explain everything causally, and eventually you won't need to bring in minds or functions or world or equipment or anything like that.

549
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:36,921
And that's the view he's going to criticize first.

550
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,441
But, oh, I'm going to, this is going to, all this is more confusing than I realized.

551
00:58:42,441 --> 00:58:45,560
But, yeah.

552
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:52,921
You also have to think, Heidegger also wants to explain the theorem attitude.

553
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:56,200
Yes, and just what I was going to say next.

554
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:56,840
That's right.

555
00:58:56,841 --> 00:59:04,201
You can have a theoretical attitude, and then you can try to explain everything.

556
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:09,481
And you can explain it, but you can't understand it.

557
00:59:09,481 --> 00:59:11,961
That is, it's right.

558
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:13,640
Descartes, this is the way you think about it.

559
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:22,600
Descartes was right trying to find the basics boot stuff that would explain how there were everything.

560
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:36,800
I mean, how there were stars and how there was hearts pumping blood, and he found out that there were how the light rays that hit the eye were conducted by the optical fiber to the brain.

561
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,841
And he was busy explaining all sorts of things.

562
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:41,840
And Heidegger thinks that's good.

563
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:43,360
That's what David wants me to say.

564
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:44,880
I mean, it's all right.

565
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:57,761
I mean, it's important to take a theoretical attitude and give a story about the causal way all of these various bits of matter interact.

566
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,320
And Descartes, given when he was writing, did a brilliant job.

567
01:00:02,321 --> 01:00:12,560
I want to say this because almost everybody who reads this thinks this that Heidegger is criticizing Descartes for trying to do science, modern science.

568
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,921
And he's not.

569
01:00:13,921 --> 01:00:19,520
So I'm going to read you two places just so we can be sure that you both, that we all agree about that.

570
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:28,800
Science, I think Heidegger wants to say, though it can't explain all this in order to significance and stuff, because that isn't explainable.

571
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:30,801
That's only understandable.

572
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:36,961
That is, you can make it intelligible, but you can't give a causal story about it.

573
01:00:36,961 --> 01:00:42,641
Science can give an explanation of every objective event.

574
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:53,200
So on 134, he says, I hope, at the end of that first section, in the middle of the page, 101, you know, the German.

575
01:00:54,001 --> 01:01:08,001
Within certain limits, the analysis of the extensio remains independent of his, meaning Descartes, neglecting to provide an explicit interpretation for the being of extended entities.

576
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,961
That is, Heidegger's only got one understanding of being.

577
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:13,680
I'm surprised I didn't read it, which is substance, of course.

578
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:15,041
I'll read it in a second.

579
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,560
So, but Heidegger, did I say Heidegger?

580
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:22,681
Descartes only understands substances with their properties.

581
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:28,120
Extended stuff out there, that's his everything is made up of little bits of space for Descartes.

582
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:33,001
Extended stuff out there with its properties to form vortices and bump into each other.

583
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,721
It's not Newtonian yet, but he's doing his best.

584
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:54,761
And the other substance, namely the mind, with its properties, namely having ideas and desires and beliefs in it, if you've got this substance view, and you can't explain where you got it, and you can't use it to understand anything.

585
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:19,481
However, there is some, now I'm reading, there is some phenomenal justification for regarding the extensio as a basic characteristic of the world within quotes, even if by recourse to this, neither the spatiality of the world nor the entities we encounter in our environment nor even Dasein itself can be conceived ontologically.

586
01:02:19,481 --> 01:02:35,320
Now, when we get to the space chapter, just so this doesn't seem very surprising, you can get near, far between all that kind of space out of Descartes.

587
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:40,761
But what you can't get is what?

588
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:45,641
Well, you can't get here.

589
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,480
There's no here in Descartes' space world.

590
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,640
It's a world seen from nowhere.

591
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:58,041
Whereas our space, there is a here in which things are near and far and up and down and so forth.

592
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,560
We'll get to the space chapter.

593
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:17,440
But what I want you to get out of it right now is when Descartes thinks about the extensio, he's got something right about space, though there's a kind of existential space, namely the kind of space that we live in, that he can't get, because he's got it right about the galaxies.

594
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:23,680
Of course, right, and then he doesn't have any quarks and strings, but he's got the right approach, Heidegger thinks.

595
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:34,240
And another place where he says it even better, when I oh, yeah, 184 of the history of the concept of time.

596
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:59,680
So here's how he said, I don't want to lose you, keep in the back of your mind, the criticism he's going to make of Descartes is you can't use the extensia, the bits of matter, the brute facts that you use to explain everything that happens in the objective world to explain or make any sense of what's going on in our human world.

597
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:01,841
I said world one the first time, I should have said universe.

598
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:11,440
You can use this to explain what's going on in the universe, but you can't use what Descartes' race extensive to understand what's going on in our world.

599
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:17,360
So here's something a lot like that on 184, bottom of the page.

600
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:38,640
The course of the scientific inquiry into reality shows that the original mode of encounter of an environment is always already given up in favor of the established view of the world as the reality of nature, so that we may interpret the specific phenomena of the world in terms of its theoretical knowledge of the objectivity of nature.

601
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,921
Now, he agrees.

602
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:51,480
We have to give up all our involvement and look at the world differently, scientifically, objectively, theoretically, but then you can explain lots and you can really talk about it.

603
01:04:52,761 --> 01:04:55,800
There is theoretical knowledge of objective nature.

604
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:56,600
I'm going to read more.

605
01:04:56,601 --> 01:05:11,961
If we consider this work of Descartes in relation to the constitution of the mathematical sciences of nature and to the elaboration of mathematical physics in particular, these considerations then naturally assume a fundamentally positive significance.

606
01:05:11,961 --> 01:05:26,921
I wouldn't go into that if it wasn't so important to see that Heidegger, again, as I say, has nothing against science, and he has nothing against Descartes as the founder of contemporary mathematical physics.

607
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:30,280
And that's not his problem.

608
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:39,961
His problem is that Descartes can't explain our world because he's only got these two substances.

609
01:05:39,961 --> 01:05:41,400
So, let me go on.

610
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:50,280
So, a lot is left out if you do that, if you give an objective description and theoretical description of the universe.

611
01:05:50,280 --> 01:06:19,801
He says on 168 in the history of the concept of time: the more the initially experienced world is deprived of worldhood, unworlded, as we will later put it, that is, the more the initially experienced world becomes mere nature, the more we discover in it mere naturality, and that is, we discover the objectivity of physics.

612
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,041
I'm making the same point again and again.

613
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:34,240
Fine, you can leave out all out of stuff, and then you can have physics, but he's an anti-naturalist because he wants to say, but, and I want to read one more before somebody else reads anything.

614
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:40,400
The cruise, the punchline that I'm trying to set you up for here is on 94 of being in time.

615
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:44,080
This is the sort of anti-naturalist slogan.

616
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:59,440
Oh, second sentence, so 94 on 65 of the German.

617
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,120
Only in some definite mode of its own being in the world can Dasein discover entities as nature.

618
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:12,001
This manner of knowing them has the character of depriving the world of its worldhood in a definite way.

619
01:07:12,001 --> 01:07:13,760
I've just been talking about that.

620
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:25,921
Nature, as the categorial aggregate of those structures of being which a definite entity encountered within the world may possess, can never make worldhood intelligible.

621
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:31,760
I said the slogan was: naturalism is impossible, and that's the statement of it.

622
01:07:31,761 --> 01:07:47,041
You have to leave out so much of world and worldhood in order to get to the pure race extensive, the pure bits of matter, the brute facts, and you can't get back all that meaning that you left out.

623
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:50,080
That's Heidegger's big insight.

624
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,841
Let's see if I can say it.

625
01:07:51,921 --> 01:07:56,640
I got one more chance to say it, then I will stop.

626
01:08:02,721 --> 01:08:14,720
That means that we can't understand this whole of meaning, even if we can give a causal account that explains everything under the description of matter in motion.

627
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:19,560
I don't, I think I asked how many know Davidson's stuff, anomalous monism.

628
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:35,400
This is a kind of anomalous monism claim, but for those who know it, I mean, science can explain everything that you can describe as basic stuff moving around, but that doesn't enable it to describe at all.

629
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:41,001
That's kind of holism of energy and fields and stuff.

630
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:49,320
But there's no way that holism gets any grip on the holism of referential totality and significance.

631
01:08:51,561 --> 01:09:14,280
Here's how I wrote it: the natural kinds, like electrons, can explain why some material objects are hard and others are floppy or soft, but they can't explain the class of things in the world that are hammers because that's correlated with being a hammer and it's correlated with all of our interests, and it's a different holism.

632
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,320
They just have no way of relating to each other.

633
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:17,961
Yeah.

634
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,800
What was that?

635
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:29,480
The last thing I read, but I was reading on 169 last in.

636
01:09:29,801 --> 01:09:32,280
Oh, yeah, that's right, 169.

637
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:37,480
Let me see if I want to say.

638
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,841
Okay, now I've just got two minutes, but that's fine.

639
01:09:40,841 --> 01:09:41,800
Where are we?

640
01:09:41,801 --> 01:09:49,881
Well, that's the story very quickly: that science is fine, but naturalism is impossible.

641
01:09:49,881 --> 01:10:02,320
That is, science is fine for explaining the universe and its physical properties, but it cannot get, it cannot understand the world and its meaning relations.

642
01:10:02,641 --> 01:10:04,480
Now, that's the first move.

643
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,400
Remember the second move, and that's why I was confusing you and confusing me.

644
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,961
Descartes doesn't make this mistake.

645
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,801
Descartes' not a naturalist.

646
01:10:12,801 --> 01:10:18,560
Descartes doesn't claim that the res extensa explains meaning.

647
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:22,720
Because there's the res cogitans, the thinking thing, the mind.

648
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,881
So now we get to dualism.

649
01:10:24,881 --> 01:10:28,240
Okay, we're going to grant that we're not going to be naturalists.

650
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:32,400
You can't just say science is eventually going to explain everything.

651
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:38,160
You've got to say something about how all this meaning gets here.

652
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:43,120
And Descartes' move is to say, and it's perfectly like Husserl and like Searle.

653
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,520
I'll read you a little bit of Husserl next time.

654
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,560
That is, well, then the mind has got to put in the meaning.

655
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:55,760
It's another self-sufficient substance besides the bits of matter, the brute facts.

656
01:10:55,761 --> 01:11:05,120
That self-sufficient substance is going to put function predicates on these brute facts, and then we'll get the whole world of meaning.

657
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,560
That's the second claim.

658
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:08,640
And that turns out to doesn't work.

659
01:11:08,641 --> 01:11:10,160
That's impossible, too.

660
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,921
We'll start with the arguments why that's impossible next time.
