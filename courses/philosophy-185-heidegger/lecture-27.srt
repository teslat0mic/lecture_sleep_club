1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
The truth chapter is, I think, hard because there's so many interesting things going on in it.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:17,361
And Heidegger's really gave whole courses on logic and on the c and involving the correspondence theory of truth.

3
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:19,360
And whole courses on truth, I think.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,120
And now he's got them all condensed into a a few pages.

5
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:24,240
How many pages?

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,280
I don't know exactly here.

7
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,040
Four.

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,761
Twenty-five pages.

9
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:32,601
That's pretty condensed.

10
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:38,521
But so let's and then there's a whole lot of misunderstanding about these chapters out there.

11
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,000
Probably because they're so condensed.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,641
People think that Heidegger somehow rejects the correspondence theory of truth.

13
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:59,720
He doesn't think that when I say there I'm leaning on a lectern, that that somehow corresponds to the fact that I'm leaning on a lectern, and that he doesn't reject the correspondence theory of truth.

14
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:02,840
He wants to fix it.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:10,201
He thinks there's something wrong with the correspondence theory of truth that the whole tradition has come up with and worked out.

16
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:19,641
But he thinks that there is a way in which truth does, is correspondence, everyday ontic truth is correspondence.

17
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:33,240
And he's going to try to give you the phenomenology of that and then show you why the theory of the correspondence theory of truth doesn't work.

18
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:39,001
And then he's going to introduce an even more primordial understanding of truth.

19
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,400
This is all the outline for today.

20
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:54,521
And then, and the primordial understanding is unconcealedness or disclosing, which has been around all the time, but now it's going to be called primordial truth.

21
00:01:54,521 --> 00:02:04,920
And finally, he's got to give you a story, which I may not get to today, of, well, if primordial truth is disclosing, something must be closed.

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:13,840
Or if it's uncovering, somehow everything that you can say truths about must somehow, to begin with, be covered up.

23
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:22,720
So he has to tell you a lot about untruth and the covered, the necessary structural covered upness of experience.

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,800
So that then you'll understand why primordial truth has to be uncovering.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,280
If I cover all that today, that will be just fine.

26
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:58,001
So now to start with, the critique of the traditional theory of truth as agreement or correspondence, which means the correspondence, and this is the part that's going to turn out to be wrong, the correspondence of representations, that is, propositions, beliefs, assertions with states of affairs in the world.

27
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:04,720
That version of correspondence is what he's going to criticize.

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:31,121
But to start with, truth with correspondence is okay if you think of it in the way that Heidegger does, that somebody who holds a belief or makes an assertion succeeds in directing his or her thoughts or words or beliefs in a way that captures the way things are in themselves.

29
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:32,801
We're going to go over that.

30
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,001
That's a kind of correspondence view about truth, which is just fine.

31
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:41,760
It's pointing out things as they are in themselves.

32
00:03:41,761 --> 00:04:01,241
That's the notion of takes takes the notion of correspondence and agreement and turns it into a notion of uncovering, though it isn't denying it, it's just making clearer what is really involved in making true assertions.

33
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:07,720
So on 261, we're now going to be running around 261 for quite a while.

34
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:20,680
So there he says, and I'm just explaining this sort of condensed thing right below, above 219 in the margin, that paragraph.

35
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,680
To say that an assertion is true signifies that it uncovers the entity that it's about.

36
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,960
It covers the entity it's about as that entity is in itself.

37
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:42,201
Such an assertion points out, lets the entity be seen, that is, that's apophensis, I presume.

38
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,040
It's an apophantic assertion, which means it lets the entity be seen in its uncoveredness.

39
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,601
The being true of the assertion must be understood as being uncovering.

40
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:04,040
That is, the activity of making the assertion is the activity of uncovering.

41
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,840
That's what then enables you to have an assertion that lets the entity be seen.

42
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:19,481
So the being true of the assertion is, I think it'd be better if it was, it was, is to be uncovering.

43
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,201
Being there with a capital B and all that makes that seem sort of incomprehensible.

44
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:31,721
So he's saying what makes it true is that it uncovers, makes the assertion true.

45
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:41,721
Thus, truth has by no means the structure of an agreement between knowing and the object in the sense of a likening of one entity, the subject, to another, the object.

46
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:47,921
So now we have to sort of stop for a minute and understand.

47
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:49,361
Some lights just go on.

48
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,241
And understand that what's going on here.

49
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:02,241
So what I'm skipping ahead because I decided I should say something that I wanted to say later right now.

50
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:26,400
What's being repudiated or denied or blocked in this is that this agreement amounts to something inner in the mind agreeing with or being similar to, in some way connecting with, something outer in the external world.

51
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:41,601
That is, if you think that way, you do what Heidegger calls slipping in a representation in the story that you're just hearing about making an assertion that points out something as it is in itself.

52
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:46,881
He talks about this on 260, the slipping in of an assertion, and I'll explain that.

53
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:53,041
But I want to see the whole correspondence theory is some version of the subject-object view.

54
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:05,521
So naturally, Heidegger's going to take it on and try to fix it by getting the subject-objectness out of it and preserving the revealing of something side of it.

55
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:18,000
But he's talking on so about eight lines from the bottom of 260.

56
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:25,040
The asserting, which merely represents, is related in a sense that is its own to the picture on the wall.

57
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,721
We'll get back to the picture on the wall.

58
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,280
Let me just skip the sentence.

59
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:52,201
Any interpretation in which something else that is between the assertion and the picture in this case, any interpretation in which something else is here slipped in as what one supposedly has in mind in an assertion, that assertion that represents belies the phenomenal facts of the case as to that about which the assertion gets made.

60
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,001
Asserting is a way of being towards the thing itself that is.

61
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,800
That's the summing up of what I just said, that I wanted to relate it to the inner-outer talk.

62
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:20,121
In fact, even more, because I feel that after all this time in the course, you must feel at home, sort of at least, with the subject-object enemy, which is the Cartesianism, which is always around, and you must feel at home as to sort of what's going to be done with it.

63
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:29,081
It's always going to be transformed into some kind of skillful coping or skillful dealing story and something about the background.

64
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,160
So that's going to happen to truth, too.

65
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,001
It's going to end up to have to do with skillful dealing in the background, but we're not ready quite for that.

66
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:48,680
So look at 258, where he's talking about this at the bottom, four lines from the bottom, and clarifying the truth relation.

67
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:59,400
We must notice also what's peculiar to the terms of this relation with regards to what to do, to what do intellectus and re agree?

68
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
That is the mind and the thing.

69
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
That's the intellectus and the re.

70
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:06,201
That's just the medieval way of putting it.

71
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:10,600
So, and the idea is that there's correspondence or agreement.

72
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,521
And how do they correspond or agree?

73
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:20,641
In their kind of being and in their essential content, do they give us anything at all with regard to which they can agree?

74
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:29,761
If it is along some water because I knew, having just had a cold, that I would start coughing.

75
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,841
Oh, I stopped coughing.

76
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:49,761
Because if it's impossible for intellectus and re to be equal because they're not of the same species, are they then perhaps similar?

77
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:55,361
But knowledge is still supposed to give the thing just as it is, and so forth.

78
00:09:55,361 --> 00:10:14,881
So if you think about it, you can't understand how a proposition or a statement, an assertion, or something in your mind like a belief can correspond to or be similar to a state of affairs or a thing with properties in the world.

79
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:18,160
That's just, if you're so used to it, it sounds like it's perfectly all right.

80
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,641
But Heidegger thinks it's perfectly incomprehensible.

81
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:27,601
He says a little further, I'm still at the top of 259.

82
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,840
In what way is this relation possible as a relation between intellectus and re?

83
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:38,721
From these questions, it becomes plain that to clarify the structure of truth, it's not enough to presuppose the relational totality.

84
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:44,961
We must go back and inquire into the context of being to provide support for this totality.

85
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:50,240
Well, the context of being, I think he means the understanding of subjects and objects.

86
00:10:50,241 --> 00:11:09,400
We have to go back to the inner-outer, and then from there, get a new story about being, namely, again, something to do with dealing and something to do with background, that will make us able to understand what corresponds to what and how that works.

87
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:14,920
So and now I'm back to 261.

88
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,681
I backed up there to give you his running start for that, what we read on 261.

89
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:30,521
So Heidegger's going to give you a phenomenologic, a kind of phenomenological description of a true assertion that relates to the world.

90
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:32,201
He's going to give you two, in fact.

91
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:39,001
He's going to give you a story about how assertions in general relate to the world.

92
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:51,481
And then he's going to give you an example of how a particular person relates, a particular assertion made by some particular person relates to some particular something in the world.

93
00:11:51,800 --> 00:12:05,080
So starting with the general claim on 261 I think I just read that.

94
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,320
Yeah.

95
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:06,681
Okay.

96
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:15,400
What I was going to read again is that just this general statement that it's a question of uncovering and so forth.

97
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,281
That's not, there's nothing more I have to say about that.

98
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,040
And that's not really phenomenological.

99
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,841
I don't know why I said it was.

100
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,761
I guess, I'm trying to see if what if anywhere.

101
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:42,801
Maybe at the top of 261 is something like the phenomenological description of the way assertions work in general.

102
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,841
Let's try it.

103
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,480
Second line.

104
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:51,521
What comes up for confirmation is that this entity is pointed out by the asserting.

105
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:57,680
I think you don't need all of that by the being in which the assertion is made, which is.

106
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,320
So it's pointed out by the assertion.

107
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,280
If I went back and that's what I found in the translation.

108
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,800
Let me try again then.

109
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:19,361
What comes up for confirmation is that this entity is pointed out by the assertion as the assertion in its role as being towards what is put forward in the assertion.

110
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:31,761
Thus, what is to be confirmed is that such being uncovers the entity toward which it is, which gets demonstrated, what gets demonstrated is the being and covering of the assertion.

111
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,400
Skipping a sentence.

112
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,121
The entity itself, which one has in mind, shows itself just as it is in itself.

113
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:49,601
That is to say, it shows that it in itself sameness is just as it gets pointed out in the assertion as being, just as it gets uncovered as being.

114
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:56,880
Yeah, all that is a general description of the phenomena of making true assertions about things.

115
00:13:57,521 --> 00:14:03,761
And then again, just I'll bore you with this, but you've got to keep, you always have to know the view that's being rejected.

116
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:16,321
And since the view that's being rejected here, the correspondence view, is something so obvious to everybody in our Cartesian time, that I've got to keep pointing out that that is, he's rejecting the next sentence.

117
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,080
Representations do not get compared, either among themselves or in relation to the real thing.

118
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:32,200
What is to be demonstrated is not an agreement of knowing with its object, still less of the psychical with the physical, but neither is it an agreement between contents of consciousness among themselves.

119
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:44,440
That is, it's not a correspondence theory, and he just throws in it's not a coherence theory either, where truth is something where that fits in with all the rest of what you already believe.

120
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:53,001
Okay, now the interesting, more fun thing is his example.

121
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,921
Now he's going to give you, just say, okay, look at the phenomena.

122
00:14:56,921 --> 00:15:03,800
And I brought in a paragraph from the metaphysical foundations of logic on page 125.

123
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,241
It's not something you're likely to want to go back and look at because it's something very similar to what's in here.

124
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,440
But it's fun because it's a course.

125
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:15,640
So here he is in the classroom, like us.

126
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,880
And he says, if someone here in the classroom, you can just, I'll just be him, channel him.

127
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:30,280
If someone here in the classroom makes the assertion, the board is green, it says black here, but we have to bring it up to context.

128
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:39,721
The board is green and does so in the immediately given context of a question and answer, to what are we then directed in interpreting the assertion?

129
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:43,241
The assertion, namely, the board is green.

130
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,961
Perhaps, now he's going to give you a lot of wrong answers.

131
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:55,241
Perhaps to the phonetic articulation or to the representation which the assertion makes and for which the uttered sounds are signs.

132
00:15:55,241 --> 00:16:11,920
No, rather we are directed to the board itself here on the wall, and precisely in perceiving this board, or rather in making the board present in thinking about it, and in nothing else, we participate in and repeat the making of the assertion.

133
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,880
That which gives itself immediately in the assertion is that about which it asserts.

134
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,880
That's again, don't slip anything in.

135
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:25,920
If I make the assertion that the board is green, then my assertion refers directly to the board.

136
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:30,241
It isn't, there's no need to have any other entity in looking.

137
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,080
And if there is another entity slipped in, then of course you'd never be able to understand how that entity corresponds to or agrees with the blackboard.

138
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,561
So you better not slip another entity in.

139
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:45,280
There's something sort of, I don't know, worrying about you all.

140
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,401
This seems so strange or something or so obvious.

141
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:51,120
Anybody have any questions or problems?

142
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:57,761
Maybe this represents, maybe your looks, is a look of concentration and not of something else.

143
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:58,721
Yes.

144
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,121
Oh, well, yes, I thought I'd said it already, but it doesn't.

145
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:17,600
What I'm slipping in, if I do it wrong, is a mental something called intentional content if you're Searle or called an OEMA if you're Husserl.

146
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:26,400
Something in the mind, in my mind, which agrees with and corresponds to something there, namely the green board.

147
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:35,921
That's what you're slipping in, because all you really got is the assertion, the board is green, and there it is, the board is green, and you don't need anything else.

148
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,121
And then, moreover, if you tried to use anything else, it wouldn't work anyway.

149
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:47,440
There's nothing that can get you from, if you think that you need something to get you from what's inside your mind to what's out there in the world, you're lost.

150
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,280
That's the inner-outer story.

151
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,560
And the inner-outer story, we just got so used to it, it doesn't bother us anymore.

152
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,521
But it bothers Heidegger that we don't understand that at all.

153
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:08,840
So, what we do understand, just the simple phenomenon, it's no puzzle, it's not it's that I can say these things to you and we can all see the blackboard and that it's green.

154
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,161
That's I think I'm glad you asked.

155
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,561
I mean, you're looking unsatisfied, however.

156
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,360
That's interesting.

157
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,001
You're not.

158
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:18,920
You're just traumatized.

159
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:19,481
Okay.

160
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,560
Anything else?

161
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,081
Oh, yeah, yeah.

162
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,001
That's right.

163
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:35,880
Exactly.

164
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,121
It indicates or points out, you could say.

165
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,880
He doesn't use those terms, but it points out the board as it is, yes.

166
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:49,001
Confirmation signifies the entity showing itself in its self-sayness.

167
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,761
That was part of that.

168
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,681
It seems so obvious I don't know.

169
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:56,040
I mean, that I am telling the truth.

170
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,721
That's confirmation.

171
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:06,280
It depends on the entity, namely the green blackboard, showing itself as a green blackboard.

172
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,881
That's just sort of, there's nothing puzzling about it, I don't think.

173
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,040
But if you can make me puzzle, I'll be happy.

174
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,880
Yeah, that yeah, showing itself as green.

175
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:20,441
That's all.

176
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:23,080
I mean, it's just showing itself as it is.

177
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:33,800
Now, that's going to turn out to be much more problematic than I'm letting on right now, because he's going to start telling you a story about the picture although behind me is crooked in a minute.

178
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,800
And that, I think, raises very interesting issues.

179
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,440
But for the time being, I don't see anything problematic about that.

180
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:58,160
It'd have to be a really weird situation if all the light in the room was green and the blackboard was really white or something, and somebody was questioning the truth of my assertion by saying that the blackboard isn't green, then we'd have a problem.

181
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:04,160
But since everybody's seeing the blackboard is green and I'm saying it's green, that's just the basic phenomena.

182
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,920
I don't see a problem.

183
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,680
Oh, that it's self-sameness.

184
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:20,160
The truth isn't it, the truth isn't.

185
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,441
Yeah, but its self-sameness isn't the truth part.

186
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:27,921
It's that my assertion points it out as it is in itself.

187
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:39,840
It would be a coherence theory of truth if somehow I wasn't, I mean, if the truth belongs to the pointing out, and there's no place for a coherence theory.

188
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,640
Now, and the self-sameness is just a way of saying it's green.

189
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,320
It doesn't take, it doesn't have to cohere with anything else to be green.

190
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,960
It has to cohere with itself to be green, but that doesn't really add anything, I don't think.

191
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:53,280
Yeah.

192
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,320
Well, what if they were?

193
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,761
Then they wouldn't see it.

194
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:02,481
Then would my assertion become untrue?

195
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:03,840
That would be interesting.

196
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,001
I'm pointing it out as green, and nobody sees it as green.

197
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:08,721
Huh.

198
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:10,400
I've got to think about that.

199
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:14,401
I think, oh boy, I like that.

200
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,521
That's hard.

201
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:32,040
It's like something I was going to talk about in about an hour, about whether Newtonian laws are true before and after Newton's around to point them out, particularly before, let's talk.

202
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:43,241
And because I want to say, and Heidegger, you've got to keep close to common sense, otherwise you're almost surely getting it wrong.

203
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:46,840
The blackboard is green whether we're all colorblind or not.

204
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,161
It turns out that that's the first thing you've got to preserve.

205
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:54,600
So I'll remind you and I'll go back to the Newtonian thing.

206
00:21:55,161 --> 00:22:12,201
If nobody's pointing out gravity is pulling things down in Athens, because Newton hasn't been around yet, Heidegger says, then you can't say that there's anybody making any true statements about falling things at that point.

207
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:23,721
However, because he's perfectly sensible, he says, nonetheless, it's true that things are obeying the laws of gravity already and all the time, if Newton is telling the truth.

208
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:27,800
It's just that, I got to be careful.

209
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,360
And I've got to use different words than true.

210
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:47,400
Things are obeying Newton's laws in Athens all the time, though there isn't any truth involved at all, one way or the other, because truth is a relation between an assertion and what it points out.

211
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:52,600
And there's nobody around making any assertions about gravity that point anything out.

212
00:22:52,600 --> 00:23:00,680
So though everything is obeying the laws of gravity, there isn't any assertions being made that are true about it.

213
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:08,521
You standing here can say now that Newton's done his job, but it was true all along.

214
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:16,961
And that's right, that only after Newton has done his job, and now you can point out gravity and you see that there's always been gravity.

215
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,120
It's slightly weird, and you're putting your finger on what's weird, and I'm trying to get used to what's weird.

216
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:30,880
So if you're all colorblind and I say the blackboard is green, am I colorblind in your example too, or everybody else is, but I'm not?

217
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
I think it's two different interesting issues.

218
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:43,201
Let's first, I see it's colorblind, and I see it's green, and I point it out it's green, and none of you see it's green, then certainly my assertion is still true, isn't it?

219
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:46,960
It points out the blackboard as it is in itself, namely green.

220
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:59,521
Now we say, but now if we're all colorblind and I say the blackboard is green, I think it's still true, because it still points out the blackboard as it is in itself.

221
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:05,280
It doesn't, I mean, to be true, it doesn't have to correspond to your experience.

222
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,961
That sounds too inner.

223
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:10,160
It has to correspond to the object.

224
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:24,560
And you can make true, I mean, if maybe I would understand that everybody was colorblind, and I'd say that anyway, and it would be true anyway, because I had done some other test on it, or because somebody else who wasn't colorblind said so.

225
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,761
Go ahead, if you can make it more problematic.

226
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:28,161
Yeah.

227
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,720
Why are you thinking people because it's true anyway?

228
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,961
Everybody lives in different ways.

229
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Why do you have the previous position of saying color support?

230
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:41,921
That sounds like an ontic question.

231
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:45,201
Why do I have, so to speak, right to say that it's green?

232
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:56,161
I think that's a question about science has a view about that, what wavelength is coming off it, but that isn't enough because you can create illusions in which you can have green with no green wavelength coming off it.

233
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:08,440
What you have to say is, whatever our procedures are for objectively determining and reaching agreement on the property of it, that's the property it's got.

234
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:24,040
It certainly isn't going to stop being green just because a bunch of people's brains don't make it see it as green, nor is it going to be green just because, say, my brain is so fixed up that it sees it as green.

235
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,920
There's got to be objectivity and agreement.

236
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,880
I don't see why Heidegger is going to deny that.

237
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,040
Now, Curtis, you've got a view about this.

238
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:44,921
I mean, walking through the room and not finding space, let's do the board of things.

239
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:50,360
You've got a situation where even the person, the observer is saying the board is green.

240
00:25:51,961 --> 00:26:14,200
There's those three words might be not like what just is very peculiar, but special case, but the general case is that we have agreed ways of determining objectively what the situation is or what the object is and so forth.

241
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:16,600
And I don't we're agreeing, I think.

242
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,481
And Heidegger's at a level of abstraction where he isn't interested in that or caring about it.

243
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:34,120
What he cares about is that, however, things do have objective characteristics, and assertions are true when they point the things out as they are, namely as having those characteristics.

244
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:36,921
That's at that level of abstraction.

245
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:37,560
Yeah.

246
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:44,400
Second line?

247
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,880
Oh, he does, he does, but we haven't got there yet.

248
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:51,761
Okay, yeah.

249
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:54,880
Oh, there's a that's the most that's the more exciting part.

250
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,721
This is really rather boring, but still has to go, we have to go through it.

251
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:08,241
But his view about primordial truth is really exciting and weird and plausible and new stuff.

252
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:11,440
But anyway, so everybody's happy now?

253
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,440
Tyler, is your hand up or you're scratching your forehead?

254
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,921
Well, but you're getting to the background.

255
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:43,200
I mean, that all he's saying so far is in a kind of decontextualized way, my assertion can correspond to the object.

256
00:27:43,201 --> 00:28:01,920
But, and both of you are sort of pushing him toward the primordial truth, that it's not, you can make easily think of cases in which the background skill or background interest determines what the properties are.

257
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:04,880
And that's being ignored right now.

258
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:17,200
And he's going to say later, you really, it's always in terms of our skills, in terms of the context, and in terms of the purposes that you can make these true assertions.

259
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:22,961
And that's really what's being left out in the correspondence theory.

260
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,800
He's telling you sort of the simple phenomena of the correspondence theory.

261
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,441
He's not going to go back on it.

262
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:29,640
It's true.

263
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:39,961
The assertion is about whatever it's about, and it's true if what it's about is in itself that way.

264
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:46,040
But generally, things sort of aren't in themselves anyway in such a simple way.

265
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,521
I mean, he's got an easy case with the blackboard and screen.

266
00:28:48,521 --> 00:29:02,280
I'll give you a case in a second in which you can see how much he has to leave out to get this simple case and how misleading it is to think that this could be an adequate account of true assertions.

267
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:15,880
There's a whole he's interested in this simply because really, I don't know how I put it, he thinks that this story about correspondence he's telling you is the truth about the phenomenon.

268
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:24,441
But he also thinks that it leaves out a much more important aspect of this whole truth-telling situation than we've even touched on yet.

269
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:27,800
And that's what you're asking about, and he's asking about.

270
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:29,880
Now you're going to do it too.

271
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,200
The black green things to be sunserving.

272
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,921
Again, we've got, but that's what I, I mean, that's what seems ontic.

273
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:50,361
We've got practices for finding out whether the black counts as green.

274
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,761
We could bring a color chip from a paint store and hold it up, and we could say, well, look, the blackboard is green 13.

275
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,481
And we'd all, and why would we all agree?

276
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:04,040
Because we've got practices like that, for agreeing if we have to on what color something is.

277
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,561
That's terribly ontic.

278
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,161
I mean, surely, that's what I said.

279
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:13,360
We've all got practices for sort of settling the question of the facts.

280
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,040
And but there is a very peculiar thing going on.

281
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:20,081
I don't think maybe you're pointing to it.

282
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,880
I can't tell.

283
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,440
But I'm going to take it that you're pointing to it.

284
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:28,641
And I'm going to say there is a sense in which the blackboard is green is a too simple example.

285
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,960
I'll give you one that sounds just as simple, and I make it very complicated in a minute.

286
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:35,121
But I saw one other hand, yeah.

287
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:45,440
And a couple of sections here about character length.

288
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:50,400
It sounds like that's one of the things we don't want to put in because of scientific exploitation.

289
00:30:51,680 --> 00:31:13,521
But I'm curious as to where in this thing does our when you made mistakes, it immediately occurred to me as not very because of what they're talking about.

290
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:19,040
It's not true that the blackboard is green?

291
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,681
That's very peculiar.

292
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:33,281
Well, because of these issues, maybe that therefore finds for the people doing now interesting is gravity.

293
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:37,680
Well, wait, look, okay, put, I understand, put gravity aside.

294
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:44,960
That's the interesting Newton thing gets raises this whole thing to a different level of theory and science.

295
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:46,240
And I don't want to do that yet.

296
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,400
The greenness I'm talking about, as I said, isn't a certain wavelength coming out of there.

297
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:59,400
That's why I said it's a color patch thing, which you can do without any commitment to any theory of color and the physics of color and of the brain.

298
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:05,961
But let me give you an example, one of mine, and then I'll show you that Heidegger's really got the same example in view.

299
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:16,121
But this one, I had this fuss with Charles Taylor at one point, in which he said, Well, it's a simple fact that there are 13 chairs in the room.

300
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,961
And I began to think about that, and it didn't seem simple at all anymore.

301
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:23,161
And that's just probably a Wittgensteinian point, but I'm not sure.

302
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:31,001
But because you can say, Well, what about suppose these chairs are in boxes, but suppose you're just about to give a lecture in there?

303
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:36,521
Then, if you ask, Are there 13 chairs in the room, and somebody says yes, and when they go in there, there's no place to sit?

304
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,161
That seems like they've misled you.

305
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:53,080
Or if there are 13 chairs, six of which are broken, then if your purpose again is to seek the class, then it isn't a helpful, even though it's sort of true that there are 13 chairs in the room.

306
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,121
You mean 13 chairs that work.

307
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,841
Or you can make more examples too.

308
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:09,641
But anyway, the idea is that the context determines even something as seemingly settled as how many chairs there are in the room.

309
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,920
There could also be chairs in the room that were museum-like chairs that nobody was allowed to sit on.

310
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:16,840
I mean, will they count as chairs in the room?

311
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:22,201
Well, they will, for some purposes, and in some contexts, and not others.

312
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:34,201
But so that begins to show, it seems to me, that the purposes might determine what counts as how many chairs there are in the room.

313
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,001
And it looks like I am not very good at imagining things.

314
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:43,281
You could go on and on imagining ways in which there are and are not 13 chairs in the room, and so forth.

315
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:46,240
But let's skip, you recognize this as Heidegger's got his own example.

316
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:47,680
Ah, Stephen, yeah?

317
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,921
One question.

318
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:54,481
In what way is this a corresponding theory of the green state?

319
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,680
If assertions don't have representational content, what is corresponding to the object?

320
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,681
What's corresponding to the object is the assertion.

321
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
And it's corresponding to the object.

322
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:14,241
If I assert that the blackboard is green, what corresponds to the assertion is that the blackboard is green.

323
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,560
You don't need any representation.

324
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,080
But it's always a good thing to try.

325
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,121
I mean, try to, it's hard to get out of a Cartesian way of thinking.

326
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,001
But there's no reason to bring mental representations into this story at all.

327
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:36,961
The assertion is doing fine to just point out the blackboard, which is also doing fine, without any representations of either one.

328
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:39,921
Their blackboard isn't a representation, it's a blackboard.

329
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:42,880
And the assertion is a sort of representation.

330
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,120
It's a linguistic something or other.

331
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,841
But it doesn't need any mental representation.

332
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:54,160
And it's not a bunch of phonetic noises on which we have to build some kind of representation.

333
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,240
Heidegger would, of course, say that's just bad cognitivism.

334
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,721
The assertion just is something we all understand and make.

335
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,721
But I want to go for a different direction now.

336
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:10,320
Namely, do you recognize Heidegger's example in it here?

337
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:13,761
In his classroom, he's got his blackboard.

338
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,001
But let me read what he says right after the blackboard.

339
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:17,120
He makes a general claim.

340
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,080
And then I'm going to switch to his book example.

341
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,361
The meaning of an assertion, I'm reading now, right after the blackboard.

342
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:31,080
The meaning of an assertion then is to be cashed out in terms of that towards which the speaker and hearer of the assertion are directed through the assertion.

343
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:37,160
The relation between an assertion and the world is thus not a relation of representation, according to Heidegger.

344
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,240
No, I stuck at it.

345
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,921
It's not a representation, but a relation of indication.

346
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:45,641
I mean, as if she was talking to Stephen there.

347
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:57,881
But now, remember, his example is that you have your back toward the wall, and you make the assertion that the picture on the wall is crooked.

348
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:02,521
I just, I have this idea, I'm sort of spelling out this more than Heidegger does.

349
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:17,321
I think that there are three sort of background qualifications that you have to have to be able to sort of fix what you're talking about and how the assertion works.

350
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:28,121
And we've seen one with the chairs, sort of what you're trying to do with whatever you're talking about might turn out to determine how many of whatever's there are.

351
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:31,560
But now, what's going on with the picture behind you?

352
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,681
It's crooked.

353
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,361
Well, I think two more qualifications are in there.

354
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:41,401
One is that you've got to have what Charles Taylor calls an epistemological skill.

355
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,721
He writes about this picture example.

356
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:50,841
And he has his example of Johnny, and you send Johnny into the room and you ask him, is the picture crooked?

357
00:36:50,841 --> 00:37:07,080
And Johnny has an epistemological skill, namely, and this is more Merleau-Ponty than Heidegger, though Heidegger wouldn't disagree, namely, he knows how to get the light right and to get the distance to the picture right and to stand on his feet and not lie down and look at it and so forth.

358
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,120
So he knows how to tell whether a picture is crooked.

359
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,401
That's a skill.

360
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:18,080
And when he, with his skill, says it's askew, then he gets it right.

361
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:29,760
And that's bringing, we are always bringing in that kind of skill whenever we're, I mean, it's much hidden in the back, in the blackboard one, but it's there too.

362
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,241
I'm sure we could figure it out.

363
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,001
But I want to think of something.

364
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,481
I was about to say something just a second.

365
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,400
Oh, yeah.

366
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:43,360
Just the other half of Taylor is to say, and Johnny doesn't have the skill.

367
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:50,560
If you'll say, go in and tell me whether the picture on the wall in the other room is a Matisse picture, then Johnny lacks that skill.

368
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,481
So you can see that it's a skill to be able to tell if the blackboard is crooked.

369
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,881
He has that one.

370
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:10,161
Well, my favorite one is that there's also a kind of not an epistemological skill, but a specific skill that's required.

371
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,441
And Heidegger doesn't seem to see this at all or doesn't care.

372
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:25,681
But if you ask somebody, is the picture on the wall crooked, then if they've got the skill, say, of an architect in postmodern houses, they may tell you it's perfectly straight.

373
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:36,161
Whereas if they're some earthquake insurance company coming to tell you whether the earthquake has damaged your wall, they have a different view about whether it's crooked.

374
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:56,161
And if it's a stella, a painter that some of you probably know, or I don't even know what you call a painter anymore, but making sort of things which come outside the frame in all directions, so you can't tell whether they're right side up or upside down, let alone whether they're crooked, then you'd have to have that kind of skill to be able to answer this question.

375
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,121
And if you're an architect, you know, you would then know how all the walls are supposed to work together.

376
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:09,401
You can get these situations where the picture looks crooked and it isn't really, or whether it really is crooked and doesn't look crooked.

377
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:11,241
There are all kinds of possibilities.

378
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:26,681
And that means that you need to be a kind of coping expert and have familiarity with pictures and walls and rooms before you can just march in and answer the question: is the picture behind me crooked?

379
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,640
Now, I'm sure Heidegger doesn't object to that.

380
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,881
He just isn't talking about that at this point.

381
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:34,361
He's making it like the blackboard.

382
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:40,921
But when I did the blackboard, you all had this sort of intuition of various sorts that that wasn't the whole story.

383
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:45,001
And if you change it to the picture example, you can see that it isn't the whole story.

384
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:54,280
It's not easy just to say that my assertion, the picture on the wall is crooked, corresponds to the state of affairs just as it is, whether the picture is crooked or not.

385
00:39:54,281 --> 00:40:06,841
The state of affairs of whether the picture is crooked or not, in the case I just invented, isn't some objective fact that you can, without any skill and any familiarity, just discover.

386
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:16,921
There is no simple right answer to whether the story, whether the picture on the wall, the stellar on the wall in this postmodern house is crooked.

387
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:20,121
But that's all right.

388
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,280
I mean, in fact, that's what Heidegger wants.

389
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:50,480
He wants to go on from the example, the classroom example, or his picture example, to bring in what I've been sort of smuggling in, which is a whole lot of background, including, I just smuggled in, familiarity with rooms, which have to be already there in place before you can just make a true assertion that the picture on the wall is crooked.

390
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,201
Let me catch up where I am now.

391
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:57,521
So on 260.

392
00:40:57,841 --> 00:40:58,880
That's the picture.

393
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:05,921
Just so I mean, you know where it's over at the bottom of 260, I read it.

394
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:12,001
What one has in mind is the real picture and nothing else, any interpretation and so forth and so forth.

395
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:16,721
That he doesn't go on and tell you a whole story about crooked, but he will in a minute.

396
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,721
So something like that.

397
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,881
So I'm just going to sum up.

398
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:35,920
I mean, I'm going to go on to the primordial issue in a second, but let's just sum this up.

399
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:39,600
So Heidegger isn't against the correspondence theory of truth.

400
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:48,321
You who are reading the secondary sources, if any of you are, I haven't really asked myself this.

401
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:52,800
Do they all think that he's trying to get rid of the Heidegger's rejecting the correspondence theories?

402
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,921
Lots of people do.

403
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:59,521
Any of you read anything that I have assigned that disagrees with me on this?

404
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,640
Good.

405
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,080
How many are reading this?

406
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,880
I mean, you shouldn't be.

407
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:06,961
I mean, you'd be much better off reading just the Heidegger over and over, day and night.

408
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:10,961
But how many are reading the background books?

409
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:12,320
Very few.

410
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:12,880
One.

411
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:13,760
Which one?

412
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,040
Blattner, I suppose.

413
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,401
It's worth reading the Blattner book.

414
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:19,201
And Blattner's not going to make this mistake, I'm sure.

415
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,200
Well, I'm pretty confident.

416
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,680
Okay.

417
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,001
But I want to now, so Heidegger sums it up.

418
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:25,761
Let me see now where we are.

419
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,200
261.

420
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:48,521
Well, now that I reread this sentence, after all that interesting discussion, I think you can see that people were on the track of thinking that was a little too simple to say, as he does eight lines down, and he knows it's simple.

421
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:52,920
The entity itself, which one has in mind, shows itself just as it is in itself.

422
00:42:52,921 --> 00:43:03,161
That is to say, it shows that it is, that it in itself sameness is just as it gets pointed out in the assertion as being, just as it gets uncovered as being.

423
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,440
Well, that's going to turn out to be too simple.

424
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:11,321
But that's a kind of first-level ontic story about truth.

425
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:21,721
And it tells you generally what happens when an assertion captures the way things are.

426
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,801
That is, when an assertion or a belief is true.

427
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:32,681
And it tells you, and I'm just going to summing up what this simple example tells you before we go on to the fun one.

428
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:42,361
It tells you also that assertions are equipment for pointing out things.

429
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:48,200
So on 267, and we've been assuming it's equipment for pointing out things.

430
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:57,720
But it's something you have ready to hand, like equipment, to point out things like green blackboards or crooked pictures.

431
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,521
About eight lines down on 267.

432
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:09,960
The assertion expressed is something ready to hand, and in such a way that as something by which uncoveredness is preserved, it has in itself a relation to the entities uncovered.

433
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:15,681
So now it turns out assertions are, skipping a little, the assertion is something ready to hand.

434
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:23,040
The entities to which it is related as something that uncovers are either ready to hand or present at hand within the world, and so forth.

435
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,481
But mainly, assertions are then equipment for indicating.

436
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:30,241
And that's fine.

437
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:40,400
And then 267, again, no more mental or ideal entities.

438
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:46,721
I think maybe we've read this already, or if we haven't, it isn't something we need to read right now.

439
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,521
I shouldn't be reading that right now.

440
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:54,400
It's my mistake.

441
00:44:54,401 --> 00:45:20,721
I mean, because there is a story on 267, which we're going to have to come back to today or probably, maybe next time, where he's going to derive the kind of correspondence theory of truth that traditional philosophers have believed in, which is just not to be mysterious, that present-at-hand assertions have a present-at-hand relation, namely correspondence, to present-at-hand states of affairs.

442
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:35,600
He's going to say that's not wrong, that we can get there step by step from the ready-to-hand to the unready-to-hand to the present-at-hand with assertions, just like you can with baseballs or what is his when we do it with hammers.

443
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,361
But I want to save that.

444
00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:40,721
That doesn't really belong in my current discussion.

445
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:50,560
All we need finally is that pointing about things as they are as a kind of relation of uncovering, and that's what we've been talking about.

446
00:45:50,560 --> 00:46:00,280
So back to 261, and that basic quote which I've read already, the uncovering the entity as it is in itself, is as far as we've gotten.

447
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:09,321
So now, having had, but now we're ready to go on to something which he calls primordial true.

448
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:16,761
That's already a kind of very unfortunate, misleading way to call it.

449
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:25,560
I mean, I've been saying, look, the background plays a role in what statements are true about the picture on the wall or the chairs in the room.

450
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:33,560
And it turns out to be epistemological skill and purposes and familiarity with that kind of object in that kind of situation.

451
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,961
All of that adds up to a lot of background that has to be in place before you can make these kind of assertions.

452
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:45,560
It's just that if everybody shares the background, like the students and the blackboard, you don't notice it.

453
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:56,681
But if it turns out to be a funny kind of thing, like pictures in postmodern houses, where most people don't share the background, then you notice that there is a lot of background involved.

454
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,961
And so far, so good.

455
00:46:57,961 --> 00:47:05,080
And then Heidegger makes this alarming and crazy move, which it took him about 50 years to admit that he had made a big mistake.

456
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,321
He's a terminological mistake.

457
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:11,080
He calls this background primordial truth.

458
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:25,001
And that's because, I've said this before, when we did talk, when we did discourse, that primordial discourse was something like the, never mind, let's not fall into any further problems about discourse.

459
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:32,921
The primordial always for Heidegger means the condition, primordial X is always the condition of the possibility of X.

460
00:47:32,921 --> 00:47:45,841
Or, it's more, I'm putting it oddly, Heidegger reserves the right to name primordial X, whatever he discovers, is the condition of the possibility of X.

461
00:47:46,160 --> 00:48:02,641
That is, now, if it turns out that the background familiarity is the condition of the possibility of using assertions to point things out as they are, then that background familiarity is going to be called primordial truth.

462
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,961
And why does Heidegger regret it?

463
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:08,240
Because everybody gets confused and was confused for years.

464
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:25,121
It was only in the last thing, I think, that he published that he said he regretted his tendency, his methodological principle that you should always name the condition of the possibility of X primordial X because it had misled people about truth.

465
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:44,721
And what people thought was, well, truth is really background stuff, and it isn't really correspondence, because it looks like, I mean, there are books about Heidegger's two notions of truth, and which one is the one he really believes, and which one does he think, you know, truth is, and people get all worried and upset about that.

466
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:54,481
But there's only one notion of truth, really, correspondence, as correctly explained by, which we've said over and over.

467
00:48:54,481 --> 00:49:00,080
And then there is a big story about the conditions of the possibility of truth.

468
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,761
And if he hadn't called it truth, everything would have been all right.

469
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,040
And so you have to just keep in mind that there are always these two kinds of meanings of truth.

470
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,920
You could make one small and one capital or something that suggests they're two different words.

471
00:49:13,921 --> 00:49:15,120
And there aren't two different words.

472
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,881
They're just one word, Barheid.

473
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:19,441
And he just uses it in two different ways.

474
00:49:19,441 --> 00:49:30,521
Okay, so we're making the transition to an ontological level in which there is the condition of the possibility of making true assertion.

475
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:37,080
And whatever goes on on that level, Heidegger's going to call primordial truth.

476
00:49:37,881 --> 00:49:41,401
And the better thing would have been to call it other names he gives it.

477
00:49:41,401 --> 00:49:47,161
Disclosing is going on there, or unconcealment is going on.

478
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,281
That's what the background gives you.

479
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:53,080
There's a distinction just to get you to notice it.

480
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,440
It took me years to notice it.

481
00:49:54,441 --> 00:49:56,841
Discovering is the ontic story.

482
00:49:56,841 --> 00:50:02,681
So you can discover that the blackboard is green or the picture is crooked.

483
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:14,361
Disclosing is his name for the ontological background conditions, roughly familiarity, which makes discovering possible.

484
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:28,121
So if you don't know anything about architecture and modern pictures, then you haven't got the disclosing practices that enable you to make, to discover whether the picture is crooked or not.

485
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:37,320
Once you get used to it, it's simple, but you've got to keep your eye on the way he's using these weird terms.

486
00:50:37,321 --> 00:50:50,521
So at the bottom of 261, just this paragraph I've been reading over and over follows the following paragraph, which is now what I've been saying over and over.

487
00:50:50,521 --> 00:50:54,921
Being true as to be uncovering.

488
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:59,000
And that's uncovering is the, I never even put that down.

489
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:02,040
So there's two things: there's discovering and uncovering.

490
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,521
They mean the same thing, dis and un.

491
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:07,161
And sometimes we get one and sometimes we get the other.

492
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:18,641
But now we're going to, we're moving from discovering and uncovering, which is blackboards and pictures, to disclosing and unconcealing.

493
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:22,481
And so those are two words for the same thing.

494
00:51:22,481 --> 00:51:31,440
So being true as to be uncovering is in turn ontologically possible only on the basis of being in the world.

495
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:33,681
Now we're at this background level.

496
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:42,241
This later phenomenon, which we have known as the basic state of Dasein, is the foundation for the primordial phenomenon of truth.

497
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,401
You should just cross out primordial, I mean, if you want to keep your wits.

498
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,321
But you've got to say something like foundational or basic, which would be a better thing to say.

499
00:51:52,321 --> 00:52:07,280
And on the next page, he gets to the primordial phenomenon of truth, and then he's going to show you the way that traditional understanding of truth presupposes and depends on this primordial one.

500
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:10,160
That's what you, again, were all forcing me to try to think about.

501
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:22,881
I mean, even with the chairs in the room, the discovery and uncovering of how many chairs in the room turns out to be a lot of familiarity with chairs and rooms and lecturing and so forth.

502
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:27,441
And that's what he's now going to tell you.

503
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:32,641
And so in 263, he's telling it all over the place.

504
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,560
And I'm going to read a lot.

505
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,201
Because that's his real contribution.

506
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:51,121
As I kept saying, it's sort of nice to sort of take on correspondence and sort of assert the phenomena in a kind of direct, simple, un-Cartesian way.

507
00:52:51,120 --> 00:53:02,121
But it's important for Heidegger to say that there couldn't be correspondence if there weren't for this more primordial background coping, which is being in the world.

508
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:07,001
And now he's going to say it over and over on 263.

509
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,360
And I'm starting with the first, second full paragraph.

510
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:18,920
Being true as being uncovering is a way of being for Dasein.

511
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:28,920
What makes this very uncovering possible must necessarily be called true in a still more primordial sense.

512
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:32,921
That's this funny move with the word true.

513
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:40,921
The most primordial phenomenon of truth is first shown by the existential ontological foundations of uncovering.

514
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:47,720
Now we're going to find out more about what they are, skipping a little to the skip a paragraph.

515
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:50,361
Now, really important stuff happens.

516
00:53:50,361 --> 00:54:00,761
Our earlier analysis of the worldhood of the world and of entities within the world has shown, however, that the uncoveredness of entities within the world is grounded in the world's disclosedness.

517
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:02,760
You're getting all these terms there now.

518
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:09,881
But disclosedness is that basic character of Dasein according to which it is its there.

519
00:54:09,881 --> 00:54:17,401
That is, remember, that is being in the world from some point of view.

520
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:24,040
Disclosedness is constituted by, and here comes one of those three things that you keep your eye open for.

521
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,121
It's already got this one on my chart.

522
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:33,801
Disclosedness is constituted by disposedness, understanding, and discourse.

523
00:54:33,801 --> 00:54:41,960
Discourse, there, you know, sometimes discourse is the third one, and sometimes falling is the third one, and Heidegger's pretty confused about that.

524
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:48,001
This one has got to, and pertains primordially to the world, to being in, and to the self.

525
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:51,681
Of course, they all have that structure.

526
00:54:52,001 --> 00:54:54,800
And now get the care structure thrown in there too.

527
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:56,560
This is a big summary, this paragraph.

528
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,521
In its very structure, care is ahead of itself.

529
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:01,361
That's the understanding part.

530
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:06,961
Being already in a world, that should be the falling part, but here it's the discourse part.

531
00:55:06,961 --> 00:55:10,400
As being, no, being already, no, you have to read more, sorry.

532
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:18,560
Being ahead of itself as, now, being already in the world as being along, amidst entities within the world.

533
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,241
That's the falling part.

534
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,721
And it shouldn't be the discourse.

535
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,160
And this structure, and in this structure, the disclosedness of Dasein lies hidden.

536
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:30,001
Wait a minute, what am I doing here?

537
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:32,321
It's ahead of itself is understanding.

538
00:55:32,321 --> 00:55:34,400
Already in is.

539
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,400
Ah, no, I misread it.

540
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:37,600
Cancel what I just said.

541
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,560
Erase it.

542
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,160
This is what happens in the podcast.

543
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:43,281
Now, eternally, everybody's going to be confused about this.

544
00:55:43,521 --> 00:55:45,281
And all over the world.

545
00:55:45,281 --> 00:55:47,201
And other galaxies, even.

546
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:50,080
But let's get it straight.

547
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,001
I'll try it again.

548
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:59,441
In its very structure, care is ahead of itself, that's understanding, pressing into possibilities.

549
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:02,960
Being already in the world, that's throwingness.

550
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:09,040
That's the whatever disposedness and all that you have.

551
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,121
As being alongside entities within the world, that's coping.

552
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,680
Being amidst entities within the world.

553
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:20,320
And again, I keep wanting to say that should be called falling by his definitions.

554
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:25,281
And he does in Division II, but here he got disclosedness mixed in there.

555
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:30,441
I'm sorry, got what am I trying to say, discourse mixed in there.

556
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:39,801
But what you really want is understanding into the future, throwingness from the past, and coping in the present.

557
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:57,241
If you keep in mind all the time that these three these threefolds aren't just any old threefold, there are the threefold structure of temporality that he's got up his sleeve, which I'm giving you a secret heads up on, then that threefold structure, you can always map it.

558
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,400
Okay, now let's see where I'm supposed to be.

559
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:00,440
Then go on.

560
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,761
Oh, I want to go a little further.

561
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,481
In its very structure, care is, no, I read that.

562
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:08,121
Okay.

563
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,961
Disclosedness, okay.

564
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:18,921
Hence, only with Dasein's disclosedness is the most primordial phenomenon of truth attained.

565
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:29,560
And you have to translate that, is the most primordial phenomenon that makes truth, of which there is only one kind, namely correspondence, attained.

566
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,761
It just only confuses things.

567
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,040
But there is, I mean, don't let me talk you out of the phenomenon.

568
00:57:36,040 --> 00:58:03,720
There is the important phenomenon that if it isn't for the background skill of Dasein being in a world and throwing into it and dealing with things right now in the pursuit of its ultimate for the sake of which, all the stuff he said earlier, if it weren't for all that stuff, you couldn't have the kind of set of distinguishing of a particular state of affairs, like the blackboard being green, and a particular assertion, like saying the blackboard is green.

569
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,361
That presupposes all of the rest of this stuff.

570
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:08,040
And that's his important point.

571
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,320
That's his criticism.

572
00:58:09,321 --> 00:58:16,720
That's his real criticism of the correspondence theory, is that it thinks that all it's got to do is tell you about correspondence.

573
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:34,161
And in fact, the correspondence theory is wrong because the real story about truth must still already bring in and understand that there is this background condition necessary for being able to make any true assertions.

574
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:45,761
Now, so ontological truth, ontological, primordial, I'm squeamish about it, but I'll have to talk Heidegger jargon from now on.

575
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,480
So I will just say something like this: quotes truth.

576
00:58:48,481 --> 00:58:55,361
Ontological, primordial, that kind of thing called truth, makes ontic truth, real truth, possible.

577
00:58:55,361 --> 00:59:02,080
Propositional truth, that's the real ordinary kind, depends on a prior disclosure of the entities in the world.

578
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:07,121
That's right, which Heidegger calls primordial truth, unfortunately.

579
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:18,401
So, or in simple Heidegger, sorry, in simple Dreyfus talk, ontic truth requires the background.

580
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:23,281
And that's what I've been talking about.

581
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:39,281
And then, so what I just wrote it again: what counts as a skew for the picture depends on whether you're cleaning house, whether there's been an earthquake, whether you're hanging the picture, whether it's a stella, whether you're an architect, and so forth.

582
00:59:39,281 --> 00:59:42,721
And that's all familiarity and context.

583
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:45,760
And now comes the strange example from science.

584
00:59:45,760 --> 01:00:14,201
I really like it because I think it reveals some deep understanding of science and how it works, and I think it casts light in a funny way on the fact that you're going to have to make the claim, it's going to follow from this, that you make a true statement in science, like Newton saying something about things fall because of gravity, you're going to have to do that on some kind of background.

585
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:31,960
And what he really has in mind there is, well, let me retell you the true phenomenon before you read the weird words, because this throws everybody off, including me, when I read it.

586
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:35,481
But I know what the phenomenon is, and you've got to hold on to that.

587
01:00:35,481 --> 01:00:41,401
Remember, I say that a dozen times a day, and Heidegger says it at least once a chapter.

588
01:00:41,401 --> 01:00:46,441
So take the take, how many know Kuhn's structure of scientific evolutions?

589
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:47,080
Good.

590
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,601
More would be even better.

591
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,640
Everybody should read it.

592
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:58,200
It's the Heideggerian book on what science is and how it works, although Kuhn never read Heidegger as far as I know.

593
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,441
Every once in a while I would run across him in some meeting and say, read Heidegger, and he would say, Yes, yes.

594
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:08,361
But that didn't seem to, there's never been a reference to Heidegger in any Kuhn thing that I've ever read.

595
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:25,481
But Kuhn has this idea that scientists can only get their, do their work and make their assertions, their theories, by relating to what he calls a paradigm.

596
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:30,761
And a paradigm, it used to seem to be an example.

597
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:35,320
And so he said Newton's Principia is a paradigm for Newtonian scientists.

598
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:42,560
That is, what they do, they understand as okay if it's similar to the paradigm.

599
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:47,360
Where similar doesn't mean it has a certain bunch of features in common, he very rightly says.

600
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:49,280
But similar is is rock bottom.

601
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,001
You just have to have a sense of whether it's similar or not to the paradigm.

602
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:59,361
And that isn't quite Heideggerian yet, although Heidegger's later going to come around to paradigms.

603
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:05,681
In later Heidegger, they're called works of art and sometimes gods.

604
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,720
But and he has different interests in what.

605
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:26,800
But both Kuhn and Heidegger think that there has to be some special thing which isn't just an ordinary thing in the world, but is this an example of how things uh what really counts as something uh I don't know, valuable or positive or something like that.

606
01:02:26,801 --> 01:02:30,481
You maybe you could say, no, you can't say truth, that was only confusion.

607
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,721
Some counts as the right way of doing things or something in the world.

608
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:45,681
So the scientists, never mind the the works of art and so forth, the scientists know that they're doing good science if what they're doing corresponds to the paradigm.

609
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,200
And now, but then Kuhn comes around and changes it, right?

610
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:50,640
More into Heidegger.

611
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,921
When he decides, well, there's more to the paradigm than just the Principia book.

612
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:58,641
There is what he calls the disciplinary matrix.

613
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,840
That's the crucial thing.

614
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:12,880
The disciplinary matrix is the skills of the scientists, what problems they sets they had to solve when they were students, how they see the world so that the world looks totally different to a scientist.

615
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:33,720
I'll say, oh, he says, to take an example, uh uh a stone on a string that's swinging back and forth looks like to a n Newtonian scientist like a pendulum, but it looks to an Aristotelian like an object trying to get to its natural place, namely straight down, and having trouble for some reason or other that the Aristotles can't explain getting there.

616
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,481
Now, what's the story?

617
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,080
Why is all that important?

618
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:57,721
Because that says that Newton, unless you are inside the Newtonian paradigm, and even more generally, the Newtonian disciplinary matrix, which determines sort of how you see things, you can't make true Newtonian statements.

619
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:02,201
An Aristotelian can't understand anything about a pendulum.

620
01:04:03,321 --> 01:04:10,121
And a Newtonian certainly doesn't know how to use this phrase seeking its natural place.

621
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,721
That just seems like craziness and weird words.

622
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:21,720
Particularly when for Aristotle, some things' natural place was up, like hot air balloons, and some things in the natural place were down.

623
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:27,560
It didn't even tell you, it didn't even map on gravity.

624
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,560
So, okay, what's the moral?

625
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:37,801
Then, the moral is you can't make Newtonian true statements until the Newtonian disciplinary matrix is in place.

626
01:04:37,801 --> 01:04:45,880
And that's what Heidegger's trying to say, I think, in these weird claims at the bottom of 269, which I said I would get to.

627
01:04:47,240 --> 01:05:00,521
He says, bottom paragraph: to say that before Newton his laws were neither true nor false cannot signify that before him there were no such entities as has been uncovered and pointed out by those laws.

628
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:03,401
Through Newton, the laws became true.

629
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:07,401
And with them, now, that's the funny kind of truth, I take it.

630
01:05:07,401 --> 01:05:08,920
And this is what's so tricky.

631
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,960
Through Newton, though, well, no, wait, that's, no, that corresponds to reality.

632
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:16,640
That's the correspondence kind.

633
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:18,080
Through Newton, the laws became true.

634
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,080
And with them, entities became accessible in themselves.

635
01:05:22,081 --> 01:05:28,320
That is, he could point out something as having a certain mass.

636
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:35,920
Once entities have been uncovered, they show themselves precisely as entities which beforehand they already were.

637
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,120
That's all the ontic story.

638
01:05:39,121 --> 01:05:43,760
And what's the primordial truth story, the background story?

639
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:58,320
Well, that until Newton was around and Newton science was established and there was a disciplinary matrix so that people had Newtonian skills, they couldn't point out these entities or not point out these entities.

640
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,880
There was no access to these entities.

641
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,321
They couldn't be discovered or uncovered or gotten right or gotten wrong.

642
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:08,160
You could get the mass wrong or right.

643
01:06:08,161 --> 01:06:09,760
You can't get the mass wrong or right.

644
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,441
You don't even know what mass is.

645
01:06:11,441 --> 01:06:13,040
I mean, it's not just not knowing.

646
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:24,800
There's no way to know because nobody could tell you because there was no set of background practices in place relative to which something can be pointed out as having mass.

647
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,240
But it doesn't mean anything weird.

648
01:06:28,241 --> 01:06:34,640
It doesn't mean that if gravity is true and Newton is true, it wasn't true at the time of Aristotle.

649
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,441
It was.

650
01:06:36,481 --> 01:06:40,560
Let me read the first paragraph now and see if it fits in with this.

651
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:48,640
Dasein, the first meaning, the middle paragraph on 269, after the kind of being which truth possesses.

652
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:56,481
Dasein, as constituted by disclosedness, is essentially, you know, disclosiveness is the ontological one now.

653
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,120
Right?

654
01:06:57,121 --> 01:06:57,800
I hope.

655
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:01,401
Always worried about getting discovery.

656
01:06:57,361 --> 01:07:02,201
Yes.

657
01:07:02,361 --> 01:07:05,000
Discovery and uncovering is the ontic one.

658
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,321
We're now in the disclosing and unconceiving.

659
01:07:07,321 --> 01:07:07,720
Okay.

660
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:12,600
Dasein as constituted by disclosiveness is essentially in the truth.

661
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,160
Well, it's in the familiarity.

662
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,160
I mean, I don't know what to tell you.

663
01:07:17,161 --> 01:07:22,200
I think it would help to cross out truth and put something like background or familiarity all the time.

664
01:07:22,201 --> 01:07:23,800
It's in the background.

665
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:28,040
Disclosiveness is a kind of being which is essential to Dasein.

666
01:07:28,361 --> 01:07:33,240
There is truth only insofar as Dasein is and as long as Dasein is.

667
01:07:33,241 --> 01:07:45,000
Notice how that puts the blackboard as green and in a much more relativized place than it sounded like at the beginning of the lecture, that you can't even make that true assertion.

668
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:53,720
I mean, it wouldn't, as long as there was no Dasein around, that assertion would be neither true nor false, according to the way Heidegger's talking about it.

669
01:07:53,720 --> 01:08:06,280
There is truth only insofar as Dasein is, and so long as Dasein is, that means so long as, I'm saying now, that means so long as there's being in the world, that means so long as there's a background of skills.

670
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:08,280
Entities are uncovered.

671
01:08:08,281 --> 01:08:10,281
Now that's, remember, that means discovered.

672
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,441
This is now ontic talk.

673
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:19,960
Entities are uncovered only when Dasein is, and only as long as Dasein is, are they disclosed.

674
01:08:20,281 --> 01:08:30,120
So you're not, so entities with mass are going to be discovered only insofar as Newtonians are, and so forth.

675
01:08:30,121 --> 01:08:37,720
So Newton's laws, the principle of contradiction, any truth whatever, these are true only as long as Dasein is.

676
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:45,521
Now that makes people, it is so weird that I still have trouble getting my head around.

677
01:08:47,680 --> 01:09:09,040
If truth means pointed out as they are in themselves, which is what it means, then if there isn't any Dasein and there isn't any understanding of whatever it is, say mass, then there can't be anything, any mass being pointed out as it is in itself, so there can't be any truth.

678
01:09:09,041 --> 01:09:10,880
That's what he's claiming.

679
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:18,160
There are all kinds of statements are true only as long as Daseine is.

680
01:09:18,161 --> 01:09:20,560
Before there was any Daseine, there was no truth.

681
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,720
That is, nothing was pointed out as it was, obviously.

682
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,000
Nor will there be any after Dasein is no more.

683
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:36,240
For in such a case, truth as disclosedness, uncoveredness, uncovering and uncoveredness cannot be.

684
01:09:36,241 --> 01:09:39,600
Before Newton's laws were discovered, they were not true.

685
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,680
This is this hard thing to take.

686
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:47,200
But if you understand the way he's defining it, you can see that that's right.

687
01:09:47,201 --> 01:09:54,160
It does not follow that they were false or even that they would become false if ontically no discoveredness were any longer possible.

688
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:56,640
I don't know what the next sentence.

689
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,720
I wasn't going to read, but let's see what happens if I read it.

690
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:04,481
Just as little does the restriction imply that the being true of truths has in any way been diminished.

691
01:10:04,481 --> 01:10:05,441
Does this restriction?

692
01:10:05,441 --> 01:10:06,640
Yeah, well, hang on.

693
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:18,240
He wants to say nothing he said sort of makes something which we thought was true count no longer as uh how does he put it?

694
01:10:19,201 --> 01:10:21,120
The being true of truths.

695
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:31,000
He's not, well, I guess when he says he's not restricting the being true of truths, having just said if there was no Dasein, there wouldn't be any being true of truths.

696
01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:42,361
He wants to say that we're here, and since Dasein is, then we can talk about gravity at the time of Aristotle and so forth.

697
01:10:42,361 --> 01:11:04,920
And we, I mean, I haven't got the text here to back me up, but I'm sure he's saying that we are, and once we are, then, and we have, insofar as we have the relevant practices, we are able to make truth claims about everything that we would ever want to make truth claims about.

698
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:12,680
We, Newtonians, can make truth claims about the mass of objects in Athens and so forth.

699
01:11:13,241 --> 01:11:30,280
But what he is restricting is some kind of some notion that assertions exist or propositions in some kind of eternal way, and states of affairs exist in some kind of internal way, and have some kind of correspondence to each other, whether Dasein exists or not.

700
01:11:30,281 --> 01:11:35,960
That's all representational talk, and he's rejecting it.

701
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,321
Okay, I got as far as I thought I was going to get.

702
01:11:39,321 --> 01:11:43,880
But I want to raise at least the next move, which is because we have five more minutes.

703
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,160
But first, more important than me is you all.

704
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:53,401
Have you followed that move from ontic to ontological quotes, truth?

705
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,960
And everybody with it.

706
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,481
Yeah, Curtis.

707
01:12:00,361 --> 01:12:02,080
Well, there's certain gapsions.

708
01:12:02,081 --> 01:12:04,920
The thing, as it's not clear.

709
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,800
If the room is all the color lines evolved to be heard of color lines.

710
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:19,600
And the onlybody else who hasn't seen the black dwarf and they've never learned about anybody who was green, it's probably not true.

711
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:26,880
So somebody who's not color lines was the blackboard and discovered the black hole is green in the first place.

712
01:12:28,880 --> 01:13:06,320
Well, if I followed you, I think what happens is, and that's why it's so hard to think about it, you are thinking about it from the point of view, you know, as a Dasein who's already understood what it is for the blackboard to be green, and either what you're saying is true or false, you can't get yourself into the position in which you can't understand what it is to point out the blackboard is green, where you'd have to where you'd have to be to make, to see this weird Heidegger thing, that there wouldn't be any truth to the statement because there'd be nobody to make it, or better, no disciplinary matrix, no practices in which it made sense.

713
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:25,600
Well, maybe he did talk about he actually has to even blackboard, and that case is true.

714
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:33,920
With no background practices, then that's right.

715
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:43,840
It would be like somebody saying that things, that gravity is the in Athens before Newton.

716
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,401
That's right.

717
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:49,680
It would just be a meaningless bunch of noises, I think, for Heidegger Heidegger would say.

718
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:59,000
Not making the truth because lyrics outstream and just blacklisted screens, you know.

719
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:15,320
Okay, if everybody, I see, in a culture in which everybody's colorblind and so forth, because you have to get rid of the fact that if he's just in a culture in which that proposition would make sense to other people, but just not to them.

720
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:29,080
Not even false, right?

721
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:36,281
I mean, yeah, he, there would be no truth or falsehood in his assertion.

722
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:38,441
They would just be meaningless noises.

723
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:40,521
I guess that follows.

724
01:14:40,521 --> 01:14:42,441
Okay, let me, I have three more minutes.

725
01:14:42,441 --> 01:14:46,600
I just want to prepare you and make sure that when you're reading this, you know what to look for.

726
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:56,840
There's one interesting sort of issue that we haven't talked about, and that is the fact that there is the truth, and this used to worry me a lot.

727
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,040
It still worries me a lot, but it's an interesting thing to worry about.

728
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:06,361
If truth is disclosing, or even better, unconcealing, that is primordial truth, that is the background.

729
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:07,080
Never mind.

730
01:15:07,081 --> 01:15:22,521
I mean, if there is such a thing, it has to be such a something as unconcealment and disclosing going on in the background familiarity and practices for there to be ontic truth.

731
01:15:22,521 --> 01:15:25,320
Why do we call it unconcealment?

732
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:27,320
What's the concealing?

733
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:29,640
Why is it disclosing?

734
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,080
What's closed up?

735
01:15:31,081 --> 01:15:47,680
Heidegger needs this whole story about untruth and the essential structure of untruth to explain why he would want to describe the practices that make true assertions possible as having to unconceal things.

736
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:52,720
I'm never sure quite what's going on there, but I think we have to talk about it.

737
01:15:52,720 --> 01:16:09,521
So, what I'm going to talk about next time is, and it's in this same chapter, is Heidegger's view about untruth and the essential concealing function involved in the background practices that make true assertions possible.

738
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:18,000
The essential concealing function and the essential unconcealing function, which you could only have if there was already concealing going on.

739
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,840
Well, I don't expect you to understand that, and I'm hoping to understand it by Thursday, and you too.

740
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,640
Okay.
