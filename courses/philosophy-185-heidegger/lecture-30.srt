1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
So I want to start by taking back a serious mistake I made in my last lecture.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:16,880
Somebody tried to rescue me, I think it may have been Tyler, when I said that Heidegger's view tells us that there is no Supreme Being.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,880
Who was it who told me that's not the right way to think about it?

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,719
You, Ravi?

5
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:23,360
What?

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,560
Adam.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,120
Okay.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,479
So Adam is going to be here today.

9
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:30,399
But anyway, he's correct.

10
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,560
That's wrong, altogether wrong.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,599
I hope the person who asked me the question, who was up in that corner, will come in or will listen to the podcast.

12
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:45,839
But the story is, being in time has no view about whether there's a supreme being.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,640
The only thing that Heidegger has to say is that whatever a supreme being is, that isn't what he's interested in as being.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:11,120
And it isn't what the tradition should have been interested in as being, because being is that on the basis of which beings are understood, and the supreme being has a lot of other jobs, presumably as creator and moral legislature, legislator.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,479
And I don't even know, I suppose background of intelligibility might, and it couldn't be background of intelligibility.

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,679
It could be sort of producer of intelligible things, because beings produce things.

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,879
But Heidegger's not talking about beings.

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:40,719
He's very clear that even the Supreme Being is a being and can't isn't what he means by being and what he thinks the tradition was getting at.

19
00:01:40,719 --> 00:02:02,839
And whether you call it being or not, Heidegger's interested in something that I'll come back to this at the end, the tradition never got straight, but which he thinks is crucially important, and you're used to this now, the background practices in terms of which, on the basis of which, we make everything intelligible to ourselves and everybody else.

20
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,879
So, what should you say if you're asked, as I was, well, is Heidegger saying there's no Supreme Being?

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,799
You can say that Heidegger explicitly thinks he has no view on the subject.

22
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:28,439
He says somewhere, I couldn't find it, I don't remember where, it's not his job to tell people whether there's a Supreme Being or not, and nothing that he's doing is going to count as an answer to that question.

23
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:34,519
Everybody got to find on the basis of their own revelation whether there's a Supreme Being.

24
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,040
And that's the first thing.

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,920
And then you might want to ask, yeah, but that's what Being in Time says, but what does Heidegger think?

26
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,839
Not that that's very important.

27
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,559
I mean, it's much more important to know what Being in Time says than what Heidegger thinks.

28
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:53,559
But just for the record, Heidegger's got a very interesting and complicated relation to the Supreme Being.

29
00:02:53,559 --> 00:03:06,360
That is, Heidegger started out in Jesuit school and was studying to be a priest, and then they sort of politely eased him out of that on the basis of health.

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,040
And for some reason, it's never explained, or he eased himself out.

31
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,440
I don't know.

32
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:23,239
Anyway, he got out of it and became a Protestant and married a Protestant and gave lectures on Kierkegaard, particularly, which is the superist kind of Protestantism.

33
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,400
But that isn't even where he ended up.

34
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:36,799
He ended up a polytheist writing about the gods in Homer, as in some way on the right track of understanding what the divine is and what the sacred is.

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,360
So that's an amazingly interesting development.

36
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:57,279
So I think, I mean, so then, so there Heidegger says, but I take back as a big mistake my saying that on the basis of the distinctions in being and time, you can conclude there is no supreme being.

37
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,480
That's just wrong.

38
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,679
Heidegger does not think that being in time implies that at all.

39
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,600
Anything, any question about that?

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,839
I just feel bad of having mucked something so important.

41
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,600
Okay, well, then we can go on.

42
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,280
Today, we're in on Introduction II.

43
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:31,679
And Introduction II has got important stuff in it that you wouldn't have been able to understand until you had at least read Division I.

44
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,879
But it's all going to look sensible and straightforward to you all, having read Division I now.

45
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,719
He's going to tell you what phenomenology is mainly and why that's the right method for doing ontology.

46
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,600
But we have to sort of lead up to that.

47
00:04:49,920 --> 00:05:37,160
So we start by where we were last time: that we can't just read off the meaning of being or what being is, from Dasein's everyday understanding, because our everyday understanding, which does certainly have in it a pre-ontological understanding of being, and whenever you hear an understanding of being, you have to think, at least I do, well, the being of hammers is to be ready to hand, and the being of trees is to be present at hand, and the meaning of being is whatever it is that would combine what the meaning, the meaning of the being of objects like trees, and the being of subjects like, well, subjects, Dasein's like us, and so forth.

48
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:51,160
And whatever, and that meaning of being is certainly too close to us and too pervasive that for us to have any explicit understanding of it, all we've got is a pre-ontological understanding of it.

49
00:05:51,160 --> 00:06:07,559
I just read you the natural things to read at this point: 36 and 37 at the beginning of page 36 and 37, at the beginning of section 2 of introduction 2, which is the methodological introduction, and that's what he's going to do now.

50
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:16,920
He's going to say, the title is The Twofold Task of Working Out the Question of Being, Method and Design of the Investigation.

51
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:25,799
So he's starting to tell you on 37 this thing I keep citing, but I never actually cited the passage.

52
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,360
So you might want to look at it just because it's there.

53
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:38,759
Five lines down on 37, Dasein is ontically closest to itself and ontologically farthest, but pre-ontological, surely not a stranger.

54
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:47,640
Now that sentence would be absolutely obscure if you weren't used to it by now, that you've got this pre-ontological understanding.

55
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,799
You are an understanding of being.

56
00:06:49,799 --> 00:07:06,080
And that's as close as it can get to you, but you're so pervasively an understanding of being that you can't, you don't normally have any distance from it to step back and notice it or you have an account of it.

57
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,920
So, on I just noticed something.

58
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,640
Let me look.

59
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,720
I was going, when I talked about the God thing, I had one quote I was going to quote.

60
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,079
Now, why was I going to quote it?

61
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,639
Let me look back and see if it's important.

62
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,160
Yeah, I go back, let me go back just to put this in.

63
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:39,839
I mean, when I said that whatever being in time is about, it isn't about any entity, any being, even the Supreme Being.

64
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:45,999
It's just, he doesn't say that, but he says the thing about something that implies that.

65
00:07:45,999 --> 00:08:03,119
If you look at on 62 at the second, third sentence in the first full paragraph, being and the structure of being lie beyond every entity and every possible character which an entity may possess.

66
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,920
Being is the transcendence pure and simple.

67
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,759
That doesn't help us much.

68
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:17,920
But the first sentence says: even the Supreme Being, who has the property of being good and supreme and ultimately intelligent, is still an entity, being.

69
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,080
And therefore, Heidegger thinks that that's not what he's writing about.

70
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,480
And it's no answer to his question about what being is.

71
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,600
Now, back to where I was.

72
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:35,840
So, preontologically, on 36, we do have an understanding of being.

73
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:55,400
He says in the middle of that bottom paragraph: to be sure, its own being, this is Dasein, is such that it is an understanding of that being and already maintains itself in each case as if in its being it has been interpreted in some manner.

74
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,840
Is that what I want?

75
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:13,720
Yeah, that's the preontological understanding, that it already has a stand on its being as a Bert Dreyfus and as a teacher, but also as a human being and also as an entity, among others.

76
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,600
That is all of that in the preontological understanding.

77
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:30,440
And we, and ontically, it's well, here is another important sentence that just is still saying what I've been saying about six lines down in that paragraph.

78
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:43,720
Ontically, of course, Dasein is not only close to us, even that which is closest, we are it, each of us ourselves, in spite of this, or rather, for just this reason, is ontologically that which is farthest.

79
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,239
Same point again.

80
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:54,680
So, you're going to have to have some special method for noticing it and being, and the understanding of being and dealing with it.

81
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:11,000
And the interesting thing is that if Dasein does stop and reflect on its being, as it has in the history of philosophy from Plato and Aristotle on, it always gets the wrong answer.

82
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:33,200
It gets the wrong answer because the instead of the being of w of world, or the the phenomenon of world, or the being of the ready-to-hand, or the r button, which it could have thought, they could have thought about, the thing that ref you that comes into your mind when you s step back and reflect about it is something present at hand.

83
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:46,239
So Aristotle and Plato each have their own story, but it's always about something present and it's and present to hand that isn't in the German, still German is for Handen.

84
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:55,520
But it's helpful to have that wrongish translation because it's true that what they're thinking about is something present, all of them.

85
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,880
And that's interesting.

86
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,999
That is what Heidegger later calls the metaphysics of presence.

87
00:10:59,999 --> 00:12:03,440
It's just been the case from Plato on that it's it's supposed that being is some kind of supreme being which is altogether present or some totality of beings some part of which is present and Heidegger thinks I think though I don't know any place where he says it in so many words I think it's really deep and important that he thinks that being is basically absence that is everything important in Heidegger's always withdraws the re readiness to hand the equipment withdraws the world because we're so close to it is we don't see it it it withdraws the background by very definition of being a background has to withdraw that's the job of the background so naturally they all get out of the way so to speak and then somebody reflecting has left presence and and in variations they all these people have got it wrong talking about presence.

88
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,279
I've got some place where I say that I'm going to read something to see.

89
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:12,120
I don't remember what it is, so let me just see why I want to read that.

90
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,039
Hmm.

91
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,200
Oh, I'm being dyslexic and looking up the wrong thing.

92
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,439
Okay, the bottom of 36.

93
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,400
I thought it was funny, but I was getting back into the introduction one.

94
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,480
We're going to stay in introduction two.

95
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,559
And here's the statement of what I've been saying, sort of, about six lines up.

96
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:46,759
The kind of being which belongs to Dasein is rather such that in its understanding, its own being has a tendency to do so in terms of the entity towards which it comports itself approximately.

97
00:12:46,759 --> 00:13:03,880
That is, it's understanding in terms of what on reflection it sees, namely the present at hand, and in a way which is essentially constant in terms of the world, that notice, world in quotes, meaning the totality of entities.

98
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:11,800
So it's always thinking, I mean, there's something sort of funny going on here and fudged by Heidegger, and I don't think he ever faces it.

99
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:34,280
It isn't as if most of the time we have a tendency to describe ourselves and everything in terms of the being of what we are most constantly dealing with, because what we're most constantly dealing with is equipment and its mode of being and withdrawing and ready to hand.

100
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:52,360
What you have to say is, and I've been saying it to sort of help Heidegger out, when you stop to reflect and do philosophy and try to understand what kind of being a human being has, then you get the notion of substances, of present-of-hand entities with properties.

101
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,040
That's what he's got to mean.

102
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,600
When you stop to reflect on the ready-to-hand one, when you're really in the full ready-to-hand, you don't stop to reflect at all.

103
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,720
You're in the flow.

104
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,440
And when you do reflect, you get the unready-to-hand.

105
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:27,280
But if you do philosophy, then you can at least think that you've got the pure present at hand, that you have now detached yourself, taken an objective view, and paid attention to what being is, and you get some kind of answer from supreme beings to the totality of entities as what fills in the answer to that question.

106
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,040
And that's the wrong answer you get.

107
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,640
And this is where he says this on 37.

108
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:56,480
Right, if I go on from where I was at the bottom of 36, in Dasein itself, and therefore in its own understanding of being, the way the world is understood is, as we shall now, we shall show, reflected back ontologically upon the way in which Dasein itself gets interpreted.

109
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:07,440
That means that it's got this, remember, world is in quotes, that means that it thinks of itself and everything else in terms of things, of present-of-hand entities.

110
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:25,280
And that distorts, of course, and you are having read Division I can imagine, totally distorts everything important about being and understanding of being and the world and our way of being in the world.

111
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:40,239
That's all covered up by this way that the present at hand and the ontology or metaphysics of presence jumps in and seems to be the thing that we should be thinking about.

112
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,119
Anybody, if you want to interrupt me, go right ahead.

113
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,279
This is also, in a way, general.

114
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:55,880
And I wish I had, I mean, we aren't going to talk about it, we don't get to talk about any specific phenomenon in introduction one or two, because they're introductions.

115
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:04,040
And the only part that's fun is the phenomena, like the one or the referential totality or whatever.

116
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,800
But we have to do this.

117
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:14,680
And it does sort of hopefully sort of consolidate in our mind what we've been seeing in the concrete things.

118
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,280
So let's go on with this.

119
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,999
So, for example, haha, I was desperate for a phenomenon.

120
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,519
What gets distorted?

121
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,960
I've got to have an example.

122
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:34,360
What does it mean to say that in some domain, you can't help thinking in terms of the present at hand and that that distorts things?

123
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:45,479
Well, the one that I always talk about more usually because of Searle's beginning philosophy of mind right before this course in the old days and maybe in the future days.

124
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:54,119
Anyway, one of the things we do when we reflect is discover ourselves as subjects, which are kinds of substances.

125
00:16:54,119 --> 00:17:15,719
As in Descartes, we discover ourselves as thinking things, as minds, to talk the more modern way, minds with properties, and which then have to have either a mind-to-world direction of fit or a world-to-mind direction of fit.

126
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:33,039
That is, we get a story about perception and action, which have to explain how the inner stuff inside this substance, the mind, gets related to the outer stuff, substances like this and chairs and so forth.

127
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,160
And we're off.

128
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,879
We have a wrong view of action because it looks like we're always pursuing some goal which we're representing to ourselves.

129
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:42,959
That's how it looks to Searle.

130
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:52,159
And we have the wrong view of perception, and it looks like that we have a visual experience which we're then relating inner visual experience, which is caused by some outer thing.

131
00:17:52,159 --> 00:18:00,080
And everything is so distorted and covered up that you can't even see the original phenomena of flow and coping anymore.

132
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,479
And therefore, I think next point, our understanding, our pre-ontological understanding decays.

133
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:12,719
That is, since it's covered up, and it gets more and more covered up.

134
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:18,159
I mean, I was giving you the Cartesian cover-up, but it was covered up already by Plato and Aristotle.

135
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:38,959
It was covered up by everybody except the pre-Socratics who were on the right track because, according to the way Heidegger reads them, the pre-Socratics really hadn't got this idea yet that pure presence was the way things ultimately were, I don't know, at their best or something like that.

136
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:47,600
The pre-Socratics thought that presencing, which is I use this rotary term, whooshing up, was what being really was.

137
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,919
And so they were on the right track.

138
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,680
Presencing would be okay with Heidegger.

139
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:02,080
But the idea that you could just take and sort of freeze into pure presence, that's the way things started.

140
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,199
And once they started that way, they got worse and worse.

141
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:15,400
So, from the Homeric Greeks who barely had any understanding of the inner, we get the Christians who were all tied up with looking at the inner and people's desires and so forth.

142
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:17,560
Foucault is very good on that.

143
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:29,879
And we get further and further from the children of our culture, like the Homeric Greeks or the primitives, neither of whom are making this kind of mistake.

144
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:37,159
Now, we have to get that right, and that's what Division II is going to tell us.

145
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:46,039
So, I'm going to read you just because it's here, so to speak, this sort of condensed summary of Division II in two paragraphs on 38.

146
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,400
This is sort of an advertisement for next semester.

147
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:52,439
It's not supposed to be understandable at this point.

148
00:19:52,439 --> 00:20:16,199
But it's going to, he's going to argue that the right way to understand being is to see it in the context of temporality, to see that temporality is the meaning of being, to see that you have to understand being in terms of temporality.

149
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:21,480
And temporality doesn't mean the present or our stream of moments of the present.

150
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:25,879
Temporality means the whole thing from past, present, and future.

151
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,360
That's what's happening in present thing.

152
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,279
Okay, so here we are in the middle of 38, the second sentence of the second paragraph.

153
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:41,080
Our analysis of Dasein, however, is not only incomplete, it's also, in the first instance, provisional.

154
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,199
That's got to do, I take it, with the fact that it's always doing formal indication.

155
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:51,320
And always, you can always work it out more.

156
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,519
It merely brings out the being of this entity without interpreting its meaning.

157
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,320
That's what he's doing that.

158
00:20:55,479 --> 00:21:01,600
That's what you would do if you were doing anthropology.

159
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:12,320
It is rather, but for Heidegger, what he's doing is a preparatory procedure by which the horizon for the most primordial way of interpreting being may be laid bare.

160
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,159
The horizon is the context, or the upon which, or in terms of which.

161
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,560
And he wants to find out what the, and you could keep your eye open.

162
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:36,479
It's never clear whether he thinks that he's going to give us the primordial way of interpreting being or a more primordial way, because there's never, you never get to the answer.

163
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:38,639
I think that's what he ought to think.

164
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:48,639
And I think he does think it when he gets to the next, when he writes basic problems, which is this, if I keep saying, his lectures the year he published Being in Time.

165
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:55,280
And I'll read you a quote at the end where you can see that there's a, he learned something.

166
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:02,879
In Being in Time, he still keeps saying over and over, and I checked all of them, there is always the most primordial way.

167
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:12,000
Or on the next page, 39, about five lines down, time must be brought to light and genuinely conceived as the horizon for all understanding of being.

168
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:21,040
That goes with his claim somewhere in the book, which I haven't bothered to look for, that he is doing a science of being, a Wissenschaft consign.

169
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,679
I think he gives that, I don't think that's in basic problems either.

170
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,760
But here he does say that.

171
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,479
We're going to do the horizon for all understanding of being and for any way of interpreting it.

172
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:45,399
In order for us to discern this, time needs to be explicated primordially as the horizon for the understanding of being and in terms of temporality as the being of Dasein, which understands being.

173
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:50,119
Now, have I got everything I wanted to say about that?

174
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:55,960
Yeah.

175
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,000
But then I say in my notes, but see page 49, so we better see page 49.

176
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,360
Is he going to take that back?

177
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,159
I doubt it.

178
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:04,759
But what is he going to do?

179
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:13,639
Well, yes, I mean, that's when you see the other side of him, which is that he is not so sure that he's got the right answer.

180
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:17,639
At the end of that section, middle of page 49.

181
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:27,639
In any investigation in this field where the thing itself is deeply veiled, and of course it's been covered up for 2,000 years, one must take pains not to overestimate the results.

182
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:35,320
For in such an inquiry, one is constantly compelled to face the possibility of disclosing an even more primordial and more universal horizon.

183
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:45,080
Well, that seems to say that he doesn't really have the right to say, and he couldn't possibly know that he's got the primordial horizon.

184
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,959
There's always a possibility of more primordials.

185
00:23:48,040 --> 00:24:05,720
To show you what that would mean is if you had a story that accounted for all the ways of being in being and time and their kind of temporality, suppose somebody then came in, somebody in this case being Heidegger in 1933, and said, But works of art, we haven't got works of art in here.

186
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:16,199
They're neither present at hand nor ready to hand, and yet really great works of art like the Greek Temple or the medieval cathedral, are very important.

187
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,000
They focus a whole world and so forth.

188
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:25,320
And you better have a notion of how they fit into your story because they've got their mode of being.

189
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,080
They're a special kind of way of being.

190
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,919
And that would be another horizon.

191
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,040
And then you could discover something else, which Heidegger did in roughly 33.

192
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:46,239
I'm talking about a book called The Origin of the Work of Art, which I hope next fall or maybe spring, I'm going to give a course on the origin of the work of art because all these great new things come in.

193
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,360
So Heidegger discovers that there's a history of the understanding of being.

194
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,199
That's the big discovery.

195
00:24:53,199 --> 00:25:10,959
That there isn't just one right answer that the pre-Socratics had and that we lost bit by bit, where the job of being in time is to get us back in touch with these basic experiences and basic words that the pre-Socratics had, but that there was something like, first he thinks there are three.

196
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:17,519
There's Ephesus or the whooshing up view of the pre-Socratics.

197
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,999
There's production, which is putting form on matter of Aristotle.

198
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:35,199
And there's modernity, subjects knowing and using objects to satisfy their desires and so forth, our whole picture.

199
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,320
So the amazing thing is, Heidegger, look at that.

200
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:41,119
Instead of one understanding of being, there are those three.

201
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,159
And by a few years later, he has six.

202
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,479
I think maybe he stops with six.

203
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:56,560
Anyway, so these are all ways that he should see, given that it's possible that there's always a more universal horizon.

204
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,840
There sure is.

205
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:05,280
Now he needs a horizon, which he thinks he has, in terms of which the history of being becomes intelligible.

206
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,360
What is it that makes being have different forms, different styles?

207
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:18,040
So the medieval style of being is so different than the Homeric style of being and so different than the modern style of being.

208
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,159
But what's behind all of them?

209
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:21,320
Because they're still styles of being.

210
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:24,999
Well, then he's got a magic word in German.

211
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,600
I think I wrote it on the board once before.

212
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,279
I don't remember why.

213
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:37,239
Eragnus, which gets translated something like appropriation.

214
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,199
Nobody knows quite how to understand it, and I'm not going to talk about it now.

215
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:51,800
But he does think that he's got a story of something even more fundamental because he says Erignis gives being.

216
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:59,080
Now, and I'm not, as I say, I have an idea what that might mean, but I'm certainly not going to try to tell you now.

217
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,239
We've got enough on our hands.

218
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:21,800
So now, having done that, I was going to read something from Basic Problems where I said it's clear that Heidegger has gone over to, so to speak, the page 49 version of the story and not the page 40 version of the story.

219
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:32,119
By that I mean gone over to the fact that there could always be a broader horizon, and instead of saying, well, I'm going to tell you the horizon.

220
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:46,360
And so I want to read something which I've read several times in office hours, but I don't think I've ever read to the whole class, where Heidegger says that he understands that he's almost surely wrong to say that he's got the horizon.

221
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,560
Have I read you this passage where he says he's almost surely wrong?

222
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,000
Okay, I'm going to read it now.

223
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,480
It's I'm going to put it on the website, too.

224
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,399
I've got two favorite passages in Basic Problems.

225
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,959
I'm going to read them both to you, and I'm going to put them on the website.

226
00:27:56,199 --> 00:28:00,080
Here's this one.

227
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:13,119
Faulty interpretations of transcendence, which is another version of being in the world, of the basic relation of Dasein to beings and to itself.

228
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,040
So, really, it's the understanding of being.

229
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,080
Faulty interpretations of the understanding of being are no mere defects of thought.

230
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:28,879
They have their reason and their necessity in Dasein's own historical existence, meaning that there's always a changing understanding of being.

231
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:30,639
No, no, he doesn't have that yet.

232
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:52,479
Just that in this book, the tradition, I mean, you have to say it in being in time terms, we're historical because we have a tradition which hardens and covers up more and more these original, sort of primitive and primordial insights of the pre-Socratics.

233
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:58,639
And I don't know why tradition gets worse and worse and covers up more and more.

234
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:01,199
If he has a story about that, I've missed it.

235
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,560
If you find out that he tells you why, let me know.

236
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:14,639
But he certainly does think that we more and more lose touch with the original experience as the West goes down straight downhill.

237
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,320
But let me go back.

238
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,959
So he says, false interpretations are caused by Dasein's historical existence.

239
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,879
Okay, I don't know what to say about that.

240
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,080
But here comes the part I want you to hear.

241
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:40,600
In the end, these faulty interpretations, of which his may be one, must underline, be made, so that Dasein may reach the path to true phenomena by correcting them.

242
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,160
And then his admission that he may be wrong.

243
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:56,520
Without our knowing where the faulty interpretation lies, we can be quietly persuaded that there is a faulty interpretation concealed within the temporal interpretation of being as such, and again, no arbitrary one.

244
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,119
That's pretty amazing.

245
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,840
I mean, he's saying it must be the case.

246
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,600
We can be sure that the whole project of being in time is itself mistaken.

247
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:11,159
And to show that he really believes what he's saying, he never finished it.

248
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:21,560
And it was when he never did produce the understanding of being in terms of temporality because he decided that he was on much too narrow a track.

249
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,600
Starting with Dasein, it was still too much into subjectivity and Kantian way of looking at things.

250
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:35,239
And he's going to try it another way with the origin of the work of art and beyond.

251
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,159
So, anyways, there he is saying that he knows that there's a faulty interpretation.

252
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,280
And I think, not that I want you to care whether it's faulty or not.

253
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:49,080
It's a pretty brilliant and interesting trial, as you'll see next semester.

254
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:58,439
It's just that he's consistent when he says that, with the idea that there are always going to be broader horizons, more phenomena to take account of.

255
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:07,879
There's no reason to think ever if you're going to do this kind of hermeneutic interpretation, you might want to bring these words in, although that's redundant.

256
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:09,720
Hermeneutic means interpretation.

257
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:25,719
If you're going to do this kind of interpretation, which is always from the inside, from your own experience, not from the outside, like Descartes in a warm room contemplating the universe from God's point of view, Heidegger's got his own story.

258
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:46,480
You're always already inside a tradition, inside an understanding of being, and you're trying to work your way to the best, and you'll have a pre-ontological understanding which is all covered up and distorted in a mess, and you're trying to work your way to articulate a coherent and deep understanding of being, but you never get out of it being.

259
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:52,639
You remember the understanding of being, you are it, and there's no place outside it from which to think.

260
00:31:52,639 --> 00:32:08,560
Therefore, it's always possible that when you're thinking interpretively, that in your, throw in another word that you're used, you should be used to, your forehaving, which Western tradition has given you, is always going to get in the way.

261
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:15,679
I wasn't going to read this, but now I've put myself into the position of wanting to read something if I can find it.

262
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,199
Remember, right in our reading somewhere, how, what am I looking for?

263
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:24,719
How do I describe it?

264
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:32,320
The sense in which he says our tradition always goes ahead of us and determines what we will see.

265
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:34,159
Help me find it.

266
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,600
I swear it's in.

267
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,559
I think it's pretty.

268
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:38,320
I know it's in here.

269
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,320
No?

270
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,959
Maybe it's not.

271
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:43,840
Oh, sure.

272
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,119
I was only in Division I.

273
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,760
I mean, in Introduction I, I think it's in Introduction II.

274
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,999
Yeah, on page 41.

275
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,039
I wasn't going to read this, but it's just the story about how you're always already trapped inside a tradition.

276
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,639
So, the middle of the middle paragraph on 41.

277
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:05,440
Dasein has grown up both into and in a traditional way of interpreting itself.

278
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:09,919
In terms of this, it understands itself proximally and within a certain range constantly.

279
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,360
By this understanding, the possibilities of its being are disclosed and regulated.

280
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:23,959
Its own past, and this always means the past of its generation, is not something which follows along after Dasein, but something that already goes ahead of it.

281
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,479
You understand what that means?

282
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:41,080
That means that what you see when you look ahead, so to speak, and try to think further, has already been colored by the tradition, so that your past is determining what you can see, even when you try to look further ahead.

283
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,479
And that's just the structure of finitude.

284
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:48,360
That's the structure of Dasein, to be in it.

285
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,719
And just notice, because you might get confused about this.

286
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,240
I was unclear about it for years, because he never sort of focuses and defines it.

287
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,560
The tradition is a bad thing.

288
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:11,320
The tradition is part of this process of leveling and covering up, which starts right after the pre-Socratics and has to do with, I don't know what.

289
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,519
I mean, again, I don't know what it is, but I know the tradition is a bad thing.

290
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,240
Why it has to go downhill, I don't know.

291
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,320
There is something good, however.

292
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,720
This is jumping ahead to something important in Division II.

293
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:36,200
Not only does this misunderstanding come down to us, and we're shaped by it, and we are it, and because we are it, we see it everywhere, and it runs ahead of us, that's bad news.

294
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,720
But there is also something called the heritage, thank goodness.

295
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
And the heritage is the good thing.

296
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:46,679
In our practices, there are still remnants of the pre-Socratic understanding.

297
00:34:46,680 --> 00:35:04,160
If it weren't possible to work your way back to this primordial experience and understand the primordial language of the pre-Socratic Greeks, you wouldn't have any alternative position from which to get out of the narrowness and distortedness of the tradition.

298
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:12,240
So the heritage is, and people ask me and anybody, and most people don't, I think, really realize what the answer is.

299
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,280
Well, how can Heidegger understand those pre-Socratic Greeks?

300
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:27,919
They were lived a long, long time ago, and they admits that we've lost touch with what they really understood, or we don't have any conscious, any more explicit understanding of what they understood.

301
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:32,239
Aristotle already didn't understand the pre-Socratics, as some of you may know.

302
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,879
He thought they were doing kind of primitive science.

303
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:37,039
Heidegger thinks that is totally wrong.

304
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,960
He thinks they're doing ontology.

305
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:44,879
But whatever it is, something from them is still in our practices.

306
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:45,999
That's the heritage.

307
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:48,159
That's what Heidegger has to recover.

308
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:57,280
And he recovers it by finding things in our own practices that are not understandable in terms of the present at hand.

309
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:05,280
I mean, he's doing it in being in time to get us back to the two go-in and out, which is something that the pre-Socratics had too.

310
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:19,840
And he's going to later talk about the way, even for us, he mentions it already in basic, in being in time, but later in the foundation, the metaphysical...

311
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,919
No, what is the one about the animals and boredom?

312
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:40,399
Anyway, in 1930, he talks about how moods whoosh up, only he doesn't say that, but they well up and they dominate us and they are contagious and they drag us in.

313
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:43,240
Well, see, moods have the fuchsis way of being.

314
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:54,919
It's very important to him to think and describe moods because there are ways in which, I mean, I don't think he doesn't have to claim that this comes down from the pre-Socratics.

315
00:36:54,919 --> 00:37:09,080
What he has to do is find things in our experience which gives him access to the same sort of thing, which was central to the pre-Socratics and organized their world.

316
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,839
It's marginal in our world.

317
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,159
Moods, something we barely understand, as in the way Heidegger understands them.

318
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,919
We think of moods as inner, because that's how Augustine and Descartes got us to understand them.

319
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:37,560
But if you get the right description of moods and then look back at the pre-Socratics, then you can understand what presencing and whooshing up and dominating us and drawing us in and the kind of understanding of being.

320
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:42,360
Okay, and that's where I am.

321
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,360
I got to that by reading this piece of basic problems.

322
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,520
Now, we've got to get back to this.

323
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,479
Okay, you can't get outside the tradition.

324
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,520
I just read that.

325
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:56,119
It covers up the phenomenon on page 43.1.

326
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,159
We're ready for that.

327
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,320
Tradition is the bad guy.

328
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,239
First full paragraph.

329
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:07,079
When tradition becomes master, it does so in such a way that what it transmits is made so inaccessible proximally.

330
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:13,560
See, it's still transmitting bits of stuff from the pre-Socratics, but it's getting more and more inaccessible.

331
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:18,199
Made so inaccessible proximately and for the most part that it rather becomes concealed.

332
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,279
Tradition takes what has come down to us and delivers it over to self-evidence.

333
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:34,480
It blocks our access to those primordial sources, and that's the pre-Socratics, from which the categories and concepts handed down to us have been in part quite genuinely drawn.

334
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:46,080
Indeed, it makes us forget that they have had their origin and makes us suppose that going back to the sources, going back to the, something which we need not even understand.

335
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:53,679
Okay, so the idea that the current understanding of being is so self-evident that you don't have to think about these marginal things.

336
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,599
Again, John Searle is a great example.

337
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:07,360
I mean, he thinks that the subject-object understanding in ontology and science as explaining everything is something that any sensible person in our day and age just had better believe.

338
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:31,919
And Heidegger's saying, well, that's what happens if you let the tradition run ahead of you and give you the ontology that Descartes worked out, and it's a good, it's a powerful ontology, and it does certainly create modernity, but then you miss this heritage that's there unnoticed in the background.

339
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,639
Now, let's see, so we want to get back to where the tradition hadn't covered up the primordial phenomena.

340
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
This is Hong 44.

341
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:50,080
This is what he's going to do by destroying the tradition, the middle, the first full paragraph, the second or third, second sentence.

342
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,760
We understand the task.

343
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:54,479
We're going to break up this hardened tradition.

344
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:55,280
That's the task.

345
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:09,999
We understand this task as one in which, by taking the question of being as our clue, we are to destroy the traditional content of ancient ontology until we arrive at those ancient ontology, not meaning pre-Socratics, but Plato on.

346
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:20,760
Ancient ontology, until we arrive at those primordial experiences in which we achieved our first way of determining the nature of being, the way which has guided us ever since.

347
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:30,519
So he wants to get back to this experience of presencing that once upon a time was the central thing and is now way marginal.

348
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:33,000
But he can get it, he hopes to get it back.

349
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,519
So now what else?

350
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:47,879
And another thing, I guess, is that the pre-Socratics understood the background, but they couldn't articulate it.

351
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,399
They couldn't even say that it was the background.

352
00:40:51,399 --> 00:41:07,160
But they said things like: Heidegger wrote a whole, I don't know, about 40 pages on the one sentence of Anaximander that is around from 700 BC, roughly, about things coming into being as is their custom.

353
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,960
And then he has lots to say about custom and habit as very, very basic.

354
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:25,560
I take it what Heidegger's trying to do is say that Anaximander understood that the background practices, though he didn't have much, he didn't know in one sentence, he couldn't say much about them and probably couldn't do even if he had more sentences.

355
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:36,919
But why say that custom is sort of the way that being is, unless you've got something like Pascal says, custom is our nature.

356
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:41,159
And maybe that's, I think maybe Heidegger thinks that's what Anaximander thought.

357
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:47,720
I wish Adam were here because I'm sure Adam had a much more sophisticated view of the Anaximander fragment than I do.

358
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,399
Okay, so let's go on here.

359
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,879
So the how are we going to recover this original understanding of being?

360
00:41:58,879 --> 00:42:00,399
How are we going to get it back?

361
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:02,080
That's the question.

362
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:24,719
We have to use the phenomena we've got and the words that they had together to sort of triangulate what we want, namely the most primordial and basic understanding of being in our tradition, anyway.

363
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,039
That's all he wants at this being in time.

364
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:33,919
He just wants the basic insight that our tradition has been running on ever since the pre-Socratics have been losing track of it.

365
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:35,200
So, what are you going to do?

366
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:44,480
Well, one of the things you have to do is get back to the phenomena that they had, and that the primitives presumably have and so forth.

367
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,680
And how do you do that?

368
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,280
Well, that's where we are now.

369
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,079
There we are.

370
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,239
It's phenomenology, is how you do that.

371
00:42:50,240 --> 00:43:07,759
So, from now on, we're going to talk about the phenomenological method, because that's Heidegger's way of recovering this primordial understanding of being, which has temporality, not as presence, and so forth.

372
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:27,839
And Heidegger's way of doing it is a sort of funny, I mean, fun, nasty, convincing attack on Husserl, which he can make because he's now safely got his chair, got Husserl's chair in Freiburg.

373
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:40,919
And so, in the background, he's really taking over Husserl's definition of phenomenology and turning it around 180 degrees so it says exactly the opposite of what Husserl was trying to say.

374
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,719
Husserl is the ultimate metaphysics of presence.

375
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:54,999
He finally gets himself into the position of thinking that there is only the living, streaming present, the now, in our, it's the here-now predicament, and I think I talked about way back with C.I.

376
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:55,399
Lewis.

377
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,919
So, you know, Husserl.

378
00:43:56,919 --> 00:44:04,839
And now Heidegger's going to turn that around to say, no, no, the now is not even the most important dimension of temporality.

379
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,760
But he hasn't done that yet.

380
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,199
That's for next semester.

381
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:19,640
But what he's going to do now is just sort of sneak up on and flip around what phenomenology means so that phenomenology becomes his method against Husserl.

382
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,599
And so first you start with the formal conception, he said.

383
00:44:22,919 --> 00:44:25,079
And there he and Husserl are all in agreement.

384
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,840
Phenomena is what shows itself, what appears.

385
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:34,680
And even semblance is phenomena, when something appears as it isn't.

386
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:44,120
So to understand the phenomena, we have to understand appearance, and we have to understand how things can appear and how they can also be hidden.

387
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:53,240
And we have to understand when things are covered up, we have to see that they're covered up and understand how to uncover them.

388
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:02,199
All this is on page starting on 51, when he's giving you, well, starting on 49, when he's giving you the phenomenological method of investigation.

389
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,719
That's where I am now.

390
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,600
I just got hooked by an interesting passage over here I'm not talking about.

391
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,240
Because I have to look at it, the top of 48, because I may have said something wrong.

392
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,600
I don't understand why he's saying this.

393
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,000
Top of 48.

394
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:42,639
Awareness of something present at hand in its sheer present at hand, which Parmenides had already taken to guide him in his own interpretation of being as the temporal structure of pure making present.

395
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,799
Whoa, I've got to think about that.

396
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,280
Maybe only Heraclitus has got it right.

397
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,560
I think Parmenides just got dumped from the list.

398
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:52,720
I always thought it was both of them.

399
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,519
Well, I don't know.

400
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:54,480
I have to.

401
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:57,119
He makes a comeback in Heidegger.

402
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:07,120
Yes, but in being in time when he's going back to the primordial phenomenon and primordial words, I guess he's only got Heraclitus and Anaximander to go back to.

403
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,720
Okay, but then I'm sure he's going to discover Parmenides has got the right view.

404
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,280
He better.

405
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,080
I mean, he's got, he hasn't got much to go on.

406
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,679
Anyway, but in this book, I realize Parmenides is not one of the superheroes.

407
00:46:21,919 --> 00:46:25,759
He's the first of the guys who's got it totally wrong.

408
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,680
I never noticed that.

409
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:36,000
Just in case, you know, don't go around saying at cocktail parties that Parmenides got it right, because you'll be making a fool of yourself.

410
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,879
Okay, now, where were we?

411
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:48,000
I'd say the formal conception is simply what he's talking about in 51 and 52.

412
00:46:47,999 --> 00:46:55,680
And it's the old story which you've heard again and again of apophansis, or in italics, down about 15 lines.

413
00:46:56,879 --> 00:47:01,200
The phenomenon signifies that which shows itself in itself.

414
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,800
Sometimes he says shows itself as it is in itself, thing thing.

415
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:11,559
According to the Apophan, the is that Apophansis, or is that, oh, where's Adam or Needham?

416
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,919
Or is that phenomenon?

417
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,440
That's phenomena, isn't it?

418
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:26,760
Yeah, okay, accordingly, the phenomena or phenomena or phenomena are the totality of what lies in the light of day or can be brought to light.

419
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:32,039
What the Greeks sometimes identified with the that's ta'anta, isn't it?

420
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:32,759
Entities.

421
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,399
Yeah.

422
00:47:33,399 --> 00:47:33,800
Okay.

423
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,599
Never mind the details.

424
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,440
You don't have to know Greek.

425
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:46,840
Just know that the phenomenon is what shows itself as it is in itself.

426
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,599
He says it again on 54.

427
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,120
He says it all over.

428
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:59,079
At the middle, second paragraph, the phenomenon is understood from the beginning as that which shows itself in itself.

429
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:01,399
We just, that's, that's basic.

430
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,320
But that's just formal.

431
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,040
We don't know what shows itself as in itself.

432
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:19,800
Now that's just the, so the formal conception of phenomenology says that, you know, he calls it the formal conception right after the line I read in the middle of 54, the last of the bottom paragraph, at the beginning.

433
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,720
We've only arrived, he says, at the formal conception of phenomenology.

434
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,080
And it's going to get a lot more interesting when it gets more concrete.

435
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:33,720
But then there's something called the preliminary conception of phenomenology.

436
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,999
And what is the phenomenon in the distinctive sense?

437
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:40,440
And that's he's going to introduce to you on 59.

438
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:42,839
That's where he's going to flip whisceral around.

439
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:56,239
So on 59, the first full paragraph, he asks in the second sentence, what is it that phenomenology is to let us see?

440
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:59,840
What is it that must be called a phenomenon in a distinctive sense?

441
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,680
And so forth.

442
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,559
And then he goes, he makes this amazing move.

443
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,560
Remember, I said that really he's interested more in the hiddenness than in the presence.

444
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,600
Manifest, oh wait, what is it now?

445
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:21,360
Manifestly, it, namely the phenomena, is something that proximally and for the most part does not show itself at all.

446
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,720
It is something that lies hidden, in contrast to that which proximally for the most part does show itself.

447
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,800
But at the same time, it is something that belongs to what thus shows itself.

448
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:54,399
If you hear in the background, that's because, keep in mind always in my reading anyway, that we're talking about the background, the basis of which, on the basis of which is hidden, because like the light in the room, that on the basis of which the background practices withdraw, have to disappear for you to pay attention to the entities and see them and use them.

449
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:56,320
And that's what he's talking about here.

450
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,520
So it lies hidden, but at the same time, it belongs to what shows itself.

451
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:04,000
Namely, it's the background of the foreground.

452
00:50:03,999 --> 00:50:08,399
And it belongs to it so essentially as to constitute its meaning and its ground.

453
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:12,080
That's what the on the basis of which does.

454
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:30,320
Yet what remains hidden in an egregious sense or relapses and gets covered up and so forth gets disguised is not just this entity or that entity, but the being of entities are our previous observations have shown.

455
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,240
Being can be covered up so extensively that it's forgotten, and so forth.

456
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:42,120
Okay, so it turns out now that the phenomena in the distinctive sense is something essentially hidden.

457
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,239
But it's not something essentially hidden like in Kant.

458
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:47,079
He's got that in the back of his mind.

459
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,480
I forget where he actually puts it in the foreground, but I'm going to tell you right now.

460
00:50:51,479 --> 00:51:01,720
In Kant, what is essentially hidden is the thing in itself, and it's so essentially hidden that it's utterly unintelligible and we can never know it.

461
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:15,079
The phenomenon, unlike the thing in itself, is something that is essentially hidden and withdrawn, but is something you can, and when it's functioning, it's got to be hidden and withdrawn and all that.

462
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:19,639
But you can reflect on it and make it explicit.

463
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:29,000
And that's what you've been doing for the last whole semester when you talk about worldhood, the referential totality, moods, coping, and all that.

464
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:44,840
You are making that what is normally not noticed but is there in your preontological understanding, namely, really, namely, I'm going to come back to this, something like world and the structure of worldhood.

465
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,879
You're going to make all that explicit.

466
00:51:47,879 --> 00:51:48,919
And you can do that.

467
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:50,680
Phenomenology does it.

468
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,919
That's where I want to read now.

469
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:53,799
Where am I?

470
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,080
58.

471
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,320
So we've done the formal meaning on 58.

472
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,399
And the phenomena in its distinctive sense on 59.

473
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,319
And yep, okay.

474
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,159
And it's not Kant.

475
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,760
It can be hidden, but it must be.

476
00:52:14,919 --> 00:52:23,799
But if it's a phenomenon, it's one, I'm sort of stressing this essentially hidden more than he does, because I think it's more interesting and important than he realizes.

477
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,879
But anyway, but he does see that.

478
00:52:25,919 --> 00:52:30,719
So it's essentially hidden, but on the other, it can be made to show itself.

479
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,879
That's the crucial gizma.

480
00:52:32,879 --> 00:52:35,119
I mean, that's not Husserl.

481
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,640
Husserl doesn't think that the phenomena is essentially hidden.

482
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,840
And he does.

483
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:48,640
And this whole structure that Heidegger's got is his own idea.

484
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,280
And now we're back at the bottom of 54.

485
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,200
I'm doing it in a different order.

486
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,840
But now comes the crucial move.

487
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:06,720
That which already shows itself in the appearance as prior to the phenomenon as ordinarily understood, and that is more primordial than the ordinary phenomenon.

488
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:27,680
And accompanying it in every case, even though it thus shows itself unthematically, that is, the background is always there, but pre-ontological, can be brought thematically to show itself, and what thus shows itself will be, I'm skipping for something, will be the phenomena of phenomenology.

489
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:35,040
So phenomenology has got to deal with something that is hidden but can be made to show itself.

490
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:39,360
I remember that so few have had the concourse that it's not worth repeating very much.

491
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:48,560
But in Kant, Heidegger says right there at the top of 55, it's like the forms of intuition in Kant, and the forms of intuition in Kant are space and time.

492
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,720
And space and time are normally hidden, that is withdrawn.

493
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,080
You don't notice and think about space.

494
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:04,959
And time, you know what time it is, that sort of optic, but time is as a big deal sort of container or whatever it is, you don't think about it at all.

495
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:08,800
And that's a good idea because it makes you dizzy to try to think about time.

496
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:17,239
But in any case, so, but you, but though they are hidden and necessarily hidden, remember, keep thinking of like the lighting in the room.

497
00:54:17,479 --> 00:54:21,720
They have to withdraw so that you can deal with the particular entities.

498
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,879
You can make them explicit and thematize them.

499
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:27,239
That's what Heidegger does.

500
00:54:27,879 --> 00:54:29,000
And he does it.

501
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,240
And phenomenology is the name for the activity in which you do it.

502
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,280
And that just takes it away from Husserl.

503
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:42,999
That makes Husserl just the formal conception, whereas he's got the distinctive concept.

504
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,999
Heidegger's got his own distinctive version of what phenomenology is.

505
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:53,480
Another way to put it is, and I think I said this, but I never can remember what I say in office hours and what I say here.

506
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:00,840
Did I talk about this sort of almost joke where there was this phenomenological summer school when I was a graduate student?

507
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:07,079
There was Spiegelberg, who was one of the early phenomenology sort of groupies around Husserl.

508
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:14,039
And he, like all of them, most of them Jewish, were refugees in the United States by that point.

509
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:15,399
Spiegelberg was at St.

510
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:18,919
Louis, and he had a summer school in phenomenology.

511
00:55:18,919 --> 00:55:25,959
And as far as I can gather from the few people I ever talked to who were there, it amounted to just describing things.

512
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:34,360
You can describe the way this bridge near his house looked on a rainy day, or how it feels to be dumped by somebody you love, or whatever.

513
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,200
That's phenomenology.

514
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:59,999
And that's and you could get that if you were a Husserl person, because Husserl, who wrote 30,000 pages in his lifetime, just describing, in shorthand, 30,000 pages, just describing everything, seeing objects, seeing people, having the social institutions, temporality, spatiality, Husserl would describe it.

515
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:05,360
But the Heidegger point is, you aren't just supposed to describe any old thing.

516
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:12,800
If you're doing phenomenology, you're supposed to describe something that has two important characteristics, or maybe three.

517
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,000
One, it's invisible, it withdraws.

518
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:20,399
Two, it's the condition for seeing whatever you do see.

519
00:56:20,399 --> 00:56:23,360
And three, it can be made visible.

520
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:29,759
But it's mainly the background condition story that Spiegelberg didn't get, and that Husserl hasn't got either.

521
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,800
Spiegelberg just was sort of reducing Husserl to absurdity.

522
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:53,919
But with the idea of the background practices again, that's what you, when Heidegger's done defining phenomenology, there's only one thing phenomenology can study, the background practices, because it's got to study something that's hidden, that is somehow dimly visible all the time, if you just don't see it.

523
00:56:53,919 --> 00:57:02,480
And it's got to be hidden, but on the basis of it, it makes possible what you do pay attention to, and you can pay attention to it.

524
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:04,320
I mean, that's what he differs from Wittgenstein.

525
00:57:04,399 --> 00:57:05,280
Remember my first lecture?

526
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,480
Wittgenstein says it's such a mess that you can't, with the background practices, there's nothing you can say about them.

527
00:57:10,479 --> 00:57:12,159
And Heidegger says, watch me.

528
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,879
And we've been saying things about them for the whole semester.

529
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:18,399
Okay, where are we now?

530
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,120
So it's got to be hidden, and it's got to be able to be made to show itself.

531
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,239
What could that be?

532
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,720
Oh, yeah, I was going to do this in a much more pedagogically fun way, but I blew it.

533
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,079
But let's do it anyway.

534
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,599
Suppose you have to lay that out.

535
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:32,399
It's hidden.

536
00:57:32,399 --> 00:57:34,879
It makes us able to see what we do see.

537
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:40,480
It's always sort of marginally known by us, and it can be made explicit by us.

538
00:57:40,479 --> 00:57:41,360
What could that be?

539
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:44,040
What fills that role?

540
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:45,480
What candidate?

541
00:57:45,479 --> 00:57:47,879
Well, the answer is supposed to be being.

542
00:57:47,879 --> 00:57:55,159
Being is what is the always there, but hidden, but can be spelled out and thematized.

543
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:00,600
That's the difference from go from pre-ontological to ontological.

544
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:05,080
That's exactly what you do when you do phenomenology.

545
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:07,479
You only need one more piece in the puzzle.

546
00:58:07,479 --> 00:58:09,560
I mean, and what's the name for that?

547
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:12,599
That thematizing when you do phenomenology?

548
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:13,879
Well, how do you do it?

549
00:58:13,879 --> 00:58:15,879
Well, that's where the oligon.

550
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:26,360
So he's got, having done the phenomena, which is what we've been doing up to now, the phenomena, namely, which is both, which is hidden but can be brought out and so forth.

551
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,919
Now we've got to do the ology of phenomenology.

552
00:58:28,919 --> 00:58:31,800
That's logos on 55.

553
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,759
So, and what does logos do?

554
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:42,200
Well, logos, or discourse, as he says, of 55, is guess what?

555
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,360
It's talking about the phenomena.

556
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,639
It makes manifest whatever it is it's talking about.

557
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:56,199
I mean, ology, you know, isn't just talking about phenomena because there's geology and what else.

558
00:58:56,519 --> 00:58:58,600
There must be a lot of ologies around.

559
00:58:58,919 --> 00:59:09,239
But phenomenon, phenomenon, phenomena is the way you talk about the phenomena.

560
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,080
This is the move he's making on 56.

561
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,919
Skipping the first full paragraph, four lines down.

562
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:42,959
The logos lets something be seen, namely, that what the discourse is about, and so forth and so forth, and skipping down now, some, in on the far right side of that first paragraph, halfway down, in discourse, so far as it is genuine, what is said is drawn from what is talked about, so that discursive communication is.

563
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,399
Oh, I just remembered that I'm supposed to be stopping 15 minutes early.

564
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:47,039
Oh, dear.

565
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:50,399
So, anyway, let's finish reading that, and then I'll worry about that.

566
00:59:53,999 --> 01:00:07,200
So, in discursive communication is drawn from what is talked about, so that the discursive communication in what it says makes manifest what it is talking about and thus makes this accessible to the other party.

567
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,239
This is the structure of logos as apophansis.

568
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,759
And it's guess what?

569
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,160
Logos is letting something be seen by pointing it out.

570
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,960
So, remember, the phenomena is just what is seen.

571
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:29,600
But now, if you're busy pointing out what is seen, making assertions about it that calls people's attention to it, that's logos.

572
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:37,040
And so, phenomenology points out the phenomena, which is normally hidden.

573
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:41,440
And now I'm going to skip stuff because I realize time is running out.

574
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,079
He does, I'll try to sort of condense it.

575
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:51,120
Heidegger talks about the modes of covered-upness next, and he goes over them very fast.

576
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:56,160
But there seem to be three modes of covered-upness on 60, and I'm just going to mention them.

577
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:02,320
There is the way the background is structurally hidden, which is the one that interests me, at the bottom of 60.

578
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,360
There are coverings up which are accidental.

579
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:10,080
There are also some which are necessary, grounded in what the thing discovered consists in.

580
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,679
And we've been talking about necessary covering up.

581
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,160
I keep repeating, that's what the light in the room is about.

582
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:22,520
Necessary covering up is how the background practices have to stay in the background so you can see the things in the foreground.

583
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:28,200
And then it also can be buried over, he talks about on 60.

584
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:38,760
That is that's what happens historically, I take it, as the tradition gets more and more hardened and the original insights get covered up.

585
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,040
And it can be disguised, he also says on 60.

586
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:44,600
Disguising is the one I really don't like.

587
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:47,640
Disguising, you'll hear lots about in Division II.

588
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:55,480
That's the fleeing story that you want to, because there's something unsettling about the background, you try to cover up the background.

589
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:58,520
And that's called disguise.

590
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:00,919
But I haven't time to say more about it anyway.

591
01:02:01,959 --> 01:02:04,840
There's more than I want to say about it in Division II.

592
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:18,599
So, well, you do phenomenology by doing, to do phenomenology is, obviously, I've been saying this again and again, but I'm going to read one place, is to do ontology.

593
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:20,040
They're meant for each other.

594
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:21,720
I mean, that's what I just said when I said it.

595
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,399
I could have done it more rhetorically.

596
01:02:23,399 --> 01:02:28,280
When you define finally what phenomenology is about, turns out it's about the background.

597
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,360
When you describe what ontology is about, it turns out it's about the background.

598
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:34,600
Turns out they were meant for each other.

599
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:41,160
And on so at the top of 60, only as phenomenology is ontology possible.

600
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,320
And in the phenomenological, I'm still reading a little more.

601
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:53,640
In the phenomenological conception of phenomenon, what one has in mind is that which shows itself is the being of entities, their meaning, and modifications.

602
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,800
So now I have to go very fast, but I can do it.

603
01:02:57,999 --> 01:03:10,160
So, and what and how and the main thing that we see this in is the phenomenon is the background, and the background is the phenomenon of world.

604
01:03:10,479 --> 01:03:16,320
So, you so the phenomenon par excellence, I think, is finally the phenomenon of world.

605
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:23,760
Because world is there, it's in the background, it's holistic, it's background practices, and it lets everything show up.

606
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:36,399
So, you do the phenomenology of the phenomenon of world, and you do the existential analysis of the structure of the phenomenon of world, and that's called worldhood.

607
01:03:36,399 --> 01:03:43,039
And what you find out is what we read long ago, but I'm going to read it again quickly.

608
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:56,480
What you find out is that the understanding of being or the phenomenon of world, book on 119, in italics in the middle of the page, the phenomenon of world is what we're going to talk about.

609
01:03:56,479 --> 01:03:58,559
And then comes, guess what?

610
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,719
The phenomenon of world gets us to the understanding of being.

611
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,919
And that's what he says in the next paragraph.

612
01:04:05,919 --> 01:04:11,440
That wherein Dasein understands itself is something which is primordially familiar.

613
01:04:11,439 --> 01:04:20,560
This familiarity with the world, with the world, does not necessarily require that the relations are theoretically transparent.

614
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:28,560
However, the possibility of giving these relations an explicit ontological interpretation is grounded in this familiarity with the world.

615
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,079
And now comes the crucial line.

616
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,839
And this familiarity in turn is constituted for Dasein and goes to make up Dasein's understanding of being.

617
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:47,240
So finally, the background practices turn out to be familiarity, and familiarity goes to make up Dasein's understanding of being.

618
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:48,600
That's terrific.

619
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:53,720
And now, in basic problems, that's my last quote.

620
01:04:53,720 --> 01:05:02,840
Heidegger says this on page 162, and I'm going to read this long quote, and then I'm going to run.

621
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,000
The middle of the top paragraph.

622
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:16,600
Transcendence, which is a name for the way the world is beyond all the entities in it, transcendence is a fundamental determination of the ontological structure of Dasein.

623
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:19,320
It belongs to the existentiality of existence.

624
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,720
Transcendence is an existential concept.

625
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:29,159
It turns out, I say this because it's so important, and another way to deal with Husserl and John Searle.

626
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,319
Transcendence is an existential concept.

627
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:37,879
It turns out that intentionality is founded in Dasein's transcendence and is possible solely for this reason.

628
01:05:37,879 --> 01:05:47,960
So that's to say, Husserl, who spent all his time thinking about intentionality, and Searle too, except that he has got a view of the background, which Husserl didn't really have.

629
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:57,800
So, but anyway, transcendence cannot, so transcendence is possible solely on the basis of what am I?

630
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,320
Transcendence cannot be explained in terms of intentionality.

631
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:16,440
Okay, the task of bringing to light the Dasein's existential constitution leads one, first of all, to the twofold task of interpreting more radically the phenomena of intentionality and transcendence.

632
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:19,239
Why it's twofold is so interesting.

633
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,839
I can't resist telling you.

634
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:28,560
I think it's because the background practices, one, you have to make the move to see that they're primordial intentionality.

635
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,079
They're not goal-directed.

636
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,640
They're not representational, but they still are a kind of coping intentionality.

637
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,759
That's one of the moves.

638
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:40,720
And the second move you have to see is that the background practices aren't even goal-directed.

639
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,680
And the background is not a kind of intentionality, but it's a kind of activity.

640
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:57,360
Nonetheless, it's a holistic way the practices function together to reveal things, even when it's not something specific that you're doing or seeing.

641
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:05,600
I think that's the twofold task, intrinsically one, of interpreting more radically the phenomena of intentionality and transcendence.

642
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,320
Now comes the punchline, which I can read and then run.

643
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:22,320
With this task of bringing to view, along with the more original conception of intentionality and transcendence, a basic determination of Dasein's whole existence, we run up against a central problem that has remained unknown to all previous philosophy.

644
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,839
I think I did read that once before.

645
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:25,199
Makes your hair stand on end.

646
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:45,840
Heidegger's saying the most important thing that anybody should have ever thought about, namely worldhood and transcendence and the meaning of being as background, has never been thought before in previous philosophy and has involved philosophy in remarkable, insoluble aporia, that is, hopeless messes.

647
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
And now that's it.

648
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,439
You've just finished Division I.

649
01:07:51,439 --> 01:07:53,520
You're ready for Division II.

650
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,439
We're going to give out time to give out the evaluations.

651
01:07:57,439 --> 01:08:00,559
Tyler, I have to come talk to me a second.
