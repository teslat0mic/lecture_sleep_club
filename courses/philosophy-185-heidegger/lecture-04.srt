1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,039
Where we ended last time was on page 92.

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:13,199
This is just to take up where we left off, talking about various versions of world.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,399
And on 92, there's a sentence that sort of pulls together things, all the things, some of the things we've been saying.

4
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:30,679
On 92, at the beginning of the bottom paragraph, on 64, about a third of the way down, worldhood is an ontological concept.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,399
Remember, that's the fourth meaning of world.

6
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:41,560
An ontological concept that stands for the structure of one of the constitutive items of being in the world.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,159
You'll discover that the next chunk of the book is about the in part.

8
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,000
But he manages to make an interesting distinction and take them apart and do them separately.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,560
He says, but we know being in the world is a way in which Dasein's character is defined existentially.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,599
Thus, worldhood itself is an existentiale.

11
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,439
All that should be familiar to you.

12
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:14,039
An existentiale, remember, was a structure of a being that has the way of being of existence, namely that takes a stand on its own being.

13
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:23,800
And so we know that it does that by having a whole lot of equipment and having a world.

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,840
So world is part of the existential structure of Dasein.

15
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,719
Now, that's just for last night.

16
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,439
Now, I want to just prepare you for two things.

17
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,759
One, I might have to go back beyond a little bit to the assigned reading.

18
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,120
I don't like to do that.

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,879
I think it's very important that I give you a chance to read it first before I talk about it.

20
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,080
And maybe we won't get there.

21
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,599
It's always hard to say.

22
00:01:48,599 --> 00:02:13,480
But what I want to warn you about is next week's reading, which starts out very simple and continues what's going to be today very simple, namely, this amazingly detailed and convincing account of the structure of worldhood, the thing that Wittgenstein said you couldn't do.

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Take this Govinnel, this hurly-burley of all the stuff that everybody's doing and find some kind of structure in it.

24
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:27,280
Heidegger finds just an amazing amount of structure in it and constantly gives you concrete examples.

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,799
It's fun to read.

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,519
It's phenomenology at its best.

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,280
And that's what we're going to do today and probably some of next Tuesday.

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:47,279
But then, out of this detailed description of the structure of worldhood, Heidegger draws ontological conclusions about being.

29
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:50,879
And it's the hardest stuff in being and time.

30
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,320
Just don't panic.

31
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,439
And if you don't understand it the first time, let me help you after 30 times.

32
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,599
I'm beginning to understand it, I think.

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,599
And it's really not only very abstract and hard, but it's very important.

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,359
It really is Heidegger's telling you what he's up to.

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
But for the time being, we get to relax and have fun.

36
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:27,599
And it's one, it's not going to be all sort of vague as I've been up to now because I was trying to describe the kind of general background of what was going on in the book and talk about the background, which is hard to talk about.

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,680
This is very concrete.

38
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:38,800
And you can just keep checking it against your own experience of hammering or writing on the board with chalk or whatever, piping at your computer or whatever.

39
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,400
I was going to say one more thing about it.

40
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,280
What was it?

41
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:43,840
Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,400
And it's best in being in time.

43
00:03:46,399 --> 00:04:05,480
So I don't have to bring in, I don't have to carry the history of the concept of time and the book on the foundations of logic and what else on this and oh, and basic problems, all of which lots of the time say something in his lectures that's more detailed or more understandable.

44
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,120
But here, I don't know any place else.

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,480
I don't know all the something like hundred books now that are out of his lectures.

46
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,319
He wrote down every course he ever gave, and they're all being published.

47
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:21,800
And I don't know any place where he goes into the detail that he does here.

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:31,000
And he obviously, I think, just decided this was he was going to work it out this time and not just sort of talk generally about it.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,079
And when he does his phenomenology, it really is fascinating.

50
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:54,680
So just think now, how would you go about trying to describe the structure of the everyday world that everybody's always involved in coping and absorb coping with, and see if you like how he does it.

51
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:10,439
So he's going to call, this is an analysis of environmentality, which is just to say of the everyday world around us that we're in and which we encounter all the time in our skillful coping.

52
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:24,920
Now, the first thing I need to say, which isn't something he needs to say, because he's writing in German, but we're reading it in English, and in the discussion in my office hours Wednesday, people, somebody, sort of challenged me on it.

53
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:34,439
They didn't think of it as a challenge, but I did, to try to explain what in the text corresponds to my talking about absorbed coping.

54
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:39,079
Because those that phrase does never occur in this translation.

55
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:48,639
So I'm going to try to tell you, so just so you've got what the German is and how I'm translating it and why, and then we will go into the details.

56
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,360
So absorb gets translated weirdly on page 80.

57
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,240
What do you mean?

58
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,079
Once or twice the translator says absorb.

59
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,319
Oh yeah, he does on 80, but he says it in a context which is very confusing.

60
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,959
The bottom of that top paragraph, the only paragraph on 80, in German we're on 54.

61
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,399
Just this sentence.

62
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:21,599
Being alongside the world in the sense of being absorbed in the world is an existential founded upon being in.

63
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, what's weird about that, I hope you already have enough of a feeling for the phenomena.

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,839
What in the world would it be to be alongside the world?

65
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,279
This is one of these remarkably wrong translations.

66
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,279
I mean, there are some translations that go, well, you could do it that way, you could do it that way.

67
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,959
Sometimes there are translations that say just the opposite of what Heidegger's trying to say.

68
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,800
You are always already involved in the midst of everything, not alongside it.

69
00:06:50,800 --> 00:07:06,560
The German, it's sort of like a bad joke, is sein by, which means being by, but it means being by in B E I in German, the way Shea means being at home.

70
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,320
If you're living at somebody's house, then you live by B E I, them.

71
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,920
And so it's fine.

72
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:23,600
What Heidegger's saying when he says sein by is being at home in the world, not being alongside the world.

73
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:31,799
Now, that would be fine to translate it that way, but you can't translate it that way because Heidegger's also got the view that we're never at home in the world.

74
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,120
That's got to do with anxiety and stuff that we come up with, we'll come up to later.

75
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,040
So, what are we going to do with Zein Bai?

76
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,399
Well, it's not easy to see.

77
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,200
One thing you know was not to do what he did.

78
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,480
Well, my version is being amidst, amidst the things.

79
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:53,640
That really doesn't get you enough of feeling sort of at home in them.

80
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,600
So, you can think of it as being at home as long as you have a little sense that in a certain way everything is weird.

81
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,039
But, okay, so much for the that.

82
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,480
And he goes right on to say, in the sense of being absorbed in the world, and absorbed is fine.

83
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:20,600
That is his word for the way you're just totally plunged into what you're doing, and when you're doing it well, you're forgetting yourself altogether.

84
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,520
And what about coping?

85
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,200
Now, I have to tell you that.

86
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,160
Well, coping gets talked about on 95 at the very what?

87
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,200
I don't see it on 90.

88
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, yeah.

89
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:52,200
Right at the beginning of that section, at the end of 66 in German, the being of those entities which we encounter as closest to us in the exhibited phenomenology phenomenologically, if we take as our clue our everyday being in the world, which we also call our dealings in the world.

90
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,840
Okay, his word for this thing I'm calling coping, he's calling dealing.

91
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,919
The German word is umgang.

92
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,120
I think coping or dealing is fine.

93
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:11,480
And he says it also means something more complicated, like intercourse with the world and figuring with things.

94
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,920
Certainly, we don't want that.

95
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,480
Dealing is okay.

96
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,240
I think coping is better.

97
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,439
I guess I think coping is better because it seems more rock-bottom.

98
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,200
I mean, remember, you're not dealing with doors and stuff in any sense of paying any attention to them.

99
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,960
You're just taking account of them and using them to get done what at that time needs to be done.

100
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,560
So I stick to coping.

101
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:47,920
So I'm going to say always that you're absorbed coping and you are amidst the things in the world.

102
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
That's the basic.

103
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,600
And now we're ready to talk about this sort of ground-level phenomena of absorbed coping.

104
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:09,920
Only you're going to talk about it now, not as the skillful activity, but sort of what you're coping with when you're absorbed coping.

105
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:20,879
And in other words, because we're starting to talk about the phenomenon in the world, we're trying to talk about the way we encounter equipment to talk like Heidegger and the environment.

106
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:28,480
And he talks about, he's going on to say something about that right away on 95, right after where I stop.

107
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,680
Such dealings have already dispersed themselves in manifold ways of concern.

108
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,320
The kind of dealing which is closest to us is, and I'm going to stick to dealing in here because that's just fine.

109
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:47,200
But I can't help thinking to sticking to coping when you hear me giving my line, because I'm just used to it, and I think it's fine, too.

110
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,480
So you just get used to hearing dealing and coping meaning the same thing, you never get used to it and don't pay any attention.

111
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Just you know what you mean.

112
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,560
So here we go again.

113
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,759
Such dealings have already dispersed themselves into manifold ways of concern.

114
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:14,520
The kind of dealing which is closest to us is, as we have shown, not a bare perceptual cognition, but rather the kind of concern which manipulates things and puts them to use and has its own kind of knowledge.

115
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,639
That's know-how.

116
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,120
The little reviews come in here.

117
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,040
That's the kind of knowledge that you have when you're able just to deal with things.

118
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:27,960
Okay, now we, having said that, we're about ready to be.

119
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,440
And that's page 67 of the German.

120
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,040
And also.

121
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,439
Yeah, and here's a passage which sounds a lot like Basic Problems, where he talks about going out the door for a minute.

122
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,639
And it's helpful.

123
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,839
So we're going to look at that too.

124
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,000
96, about five lines down, sort of the middle of page 67 of the German.

125
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,559
And the sentence before that intrigues me.

126
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,080
And as I see it, I'll just read it.

127
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,000
I wonder what he's saying there.

128
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,640
But as an investigation of being, what he's doing here, it brings to completion and explicitly the understanding of being which belongs to Dasein, which comes alive in any of its dealings.

129
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,600
Well, that's good.

130
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,199
The understanding of being is always there, no matter in all the dealings.

131
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,000
We know that.

132
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,480
That's something he's going to come back to.

133
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,559
Now, so let's go what I want to read is: those entities which serve phenomenologically as our preliminary theme.

134
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,639
Remember, we're talking about the stuff now that makes up the world.

135
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:42,280
In this case, those which are used or which are to be found in the course of production become accessible when we put ourselves into the position of concerning ourselves with them in some such way.

136
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,879
Strictly speaking, this talk of putting ourselves in such a position is misleading.

137
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:53,920
For the kind of being which belongs to such concernful dealings is not one in which we need to put ourselves first.

138
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,879
This is the way in which Dasein always is.

139
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,519
When I open the door, for instance, I use the latch.

140
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:09,120
That is, we're always doing this business of to go in and out, and we're always using without even noticing it the equipment for doing that.

141
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,120
And so let's go on.

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:29,600
The achieving of phenomenological access to the entities we encounter consists, and now he's going to try to get you not to think about what we deal with as substances and not to think about our coping skills as some kind of rules, unconscious rules for how to deal with doors and so forth.

143
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,200
Those are the interpretations you want to push aside all the time.

144
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:42,560
The achieving of phenomenological access to the entities which we encounter consists rather in thrusting aside our interpretive tendencies which keep thrusting themselves upon us and running along with us.

145
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:53,520
Sometimes he says they run ahead of us and which conceal not only the phenomenon of such concern, but even more the entities themselves as encountered of their own accord in our concern.

146
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:07,840
All that's to say, well, whatever this stuff is we're going to talk about, which is equipment, of course, it's not going to be what people have always thought it was, substances with properties, and who are just sitting there, each one self-sufficient.

147
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:21,360
There are such things, but that's not what he's going to talk about because we're always already in the world, coping with doors and using the latch and so forth, and not thinking about it.

148
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:35,079
And it would be a long story, not that that doesn't interest him very much, to say what a skill is, but he certainly thinks a skill isn't anything like mental representations, conscious or unconscious, of stuff in the world and rules for coping.

149
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,440
We'll come back to that when he criticizes Descartes for thinking something like that.

150
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay, so now we've got to ready to define equipment.

151
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,839
Equipment's the probably okay translation for zoig.

152
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,879
Zeug is the German, and it's sort of funny.

153
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,240
German is such a what my kids used to call a Lego language.

154
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,879
You put all the little pieces together in bigger and bigger words, and you talk about anything that way.

155
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,320
Zeug is a little piece that goes onto anything.

156
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:17,560
There's houses, which are Bohnsoug, and there are toys, which are Spielsoug, and there are screwdrivers, which are, I don't know what, my German's not good enough.

157
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,840
Some kind of Zeug.

158
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,440
Zeug just means equipment for doing anything.

159
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,039
I mean, it's a big deal.

160
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,639
I mean, it covers everything.

161
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:35,559
That's what's which is hard to see that he's going to include houses in his story about equipment, so they're equipment for living in, and toys, and so forth.

162
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,880
Everything that we cope with are soigs.

163
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,519
And so we're going to Hoagland says paraphernalia.

164
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,919
Other people have other fancy words.

165
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,799
I think this is this is as good as any, yeah.

166
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,039
Ah, no, no, that's not right.

167
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,759
I mean, I I misled you then.

168
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,160
I hadn't really thought about making the distinction.

169
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,679
No, let's just test it.

170
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:17,200
Could there be something which was not made for coping, but which you could use in coping, a natural thing?

171
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,200
Now, let me see if we can think of one.

172
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,319
Yeah.

173
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,000
Ah, that's a nice one.

174
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,720
Okay, so there's a, I don't know, and it may be that you can't call it equipment in German.

175
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,400
I don't know what kind of toy it would be.

176
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,000
Wait, I have to, I'm stuck about this because I'm not sure.

177
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,279
If equipment is aha, it is always social.

178
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,240
That's one of the morals I was going to get out of this lecture, but I hadn't really seen it coming.

179
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,720
I can't tell you why yet.

180
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,919
But a tree that falls, you can use it.

181
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,759
But in his way of defining equipment, it doesn't count as equipment.

182
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,960
And you don't know why yet, but you're going to find out pretty soon how we're going to rule out trees.

183
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,599
Yeah.

184
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,720
Ah, what is the tree there?

185
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
Oh boy, this is interesting.

186
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,040
I don't know.

187
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,000
Let me think.

188
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,200
No, it's being used.

189
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,720
And I wouldn't be surprised that it even has readiness to hand.

190
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,559
I mean, because you can use it to cope.

191
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:42,799
And I'm discovering only this year, after all my years of teaching it, and fighting, particularly for the last three years with a TA who's no longer with us, which is a kind of relief for me.

192
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:59,759
But fighting with him about this business of whether what's, I saw, finally saw that all of our disagreement about what counts as equipment was that we weren't distinguishing what makes it equipment and what mode of being it has.

193
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:08,279
Equipment has the mode of being of readiness to hand, but so does any old tree that if you're using it as a bridge.

194
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,200
And now, how come?

195
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:22,839
I mean, once you see that, lots of things that we used to fight about, me and Rick Kenedo, like, is a hammer in a drawer still count as equipment?

196
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,240
And does it count as ready to hand?

197
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,039
And I used to keep insisting it isn't ready to hand, it isn't ready to hand, and he kept insisting it is equipment.

198
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,640
And the answer is both.

199
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes, it's equipment.

200
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,720
And when it's in the drawer, it's not ready to hand.

201
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,439
In fact, I'll come to this, but I'll say something mysterious now.

202
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:52,440
A hammer in a culture that ties things with mines or glues them and has no nails in a drawer or even in your hand isn't a hammer.

203
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,639
So we've got to sort all that out.

204
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,319
And Heidegger's got it all sorted out.

205
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,720
It's just me that didn't have it sorted out.

206
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,359
And I don't know any commentary that it has either.

207
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,439
And so we have to go step by step.

208
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,519
So we want to understand what it is to be counted as equipment.

209
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:11,240
And I bet, and soy does equal equipment.

210
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,720
And I bet that's only in a culture.

211
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,200
So she was very right to ask that question.

212
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:23,159
But we haven't defined why we can't call the fallen bridge equipment until we get to, we're going to do it.

213
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,599
We see it on page 98 and on German 69, the crucial move.

214
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,039
And that is.

215
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,720
Oh, oh no, it doesn't.

216
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,759
I mean, the thing I was going to read is a different point.

217
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:57,119
So as long as I got you to 98.6, it fits the other thing I said, namely that the being, it says the kind of being which equipment possesses, in which it manifests itself in its own right, we call readiness to hand.

218
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:07,039
And I said, yes, all equipment does have as its way of being under certain conditions, namely when we're using it, readiness to hand.

219
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,640
And so do other things.

220
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
But I didn't look up the right thing.

221
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,639
I didn't get into this when I was thinking, writing these notes from this angle.

222
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,839
So let's look for another.

223
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,200
On 68.

224
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,319
Oh, no, that's the German.

225
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,519
On 97.

226
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,960
Let's go back there.

227
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,640
Ah, okay, good.

228
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
That's important.

229
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
There we go.

230
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:35,200
What I'm trying to get is on 68, the first full paragraph in German.

231
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,039
Oh, I keep saying 68, sorry.

232
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,960
97, the first full in English.

233
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,720
68 in German.

234
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,960
Now, the crucial thing he's going to say there, I'll read that little paragraph.

235
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,240
Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as having equipment.

236
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,799
To the being of any equipment, there belongs a totality of equipment in which it can be this equipment that it is.

237
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,000
Equipment is essentially something in order to.

238
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,040
And I'll be very explained a lot there.

239
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:10,960
A totality of equipment is constituted by various ways of the in order to, such as serviceability, usability, and so forth.

240
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,720
And he goes on, all this is important.

241
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Let me just tell you what we're really looking for.

242
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,480
We're looking for the holism, what it's crucial to something.

243
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,960
This is so important for Heidegger that he has seen this, and it's right, and it makes a big deal point for him.

244
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,799
That equipment is always only equipment in a totality of other equipment.

245
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:43,639
And that's the crucial thing that's going to make the, you see why the bridge, why the tree is not going to turn out to be equipment, it's not in a totality of other equipment.

246
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,320
If it were a bridge, it would be.

247
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:52,279
It would have a road leading up to it, and it would have a place for boats to go under it, and so forth, and it would be in the totality.

248
00:21:52,599 --> 00:22:04,439
But by the way, just a fussy point, but still, totality is sort of misleading because totality could just be a heap of bricks or something.

249
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:25,319
The Gestalt people, who are really interested in holism, would say not that this Garnsheit, which is the German, should be translated here anyway, a whole, where in a whole, and I think I should say this, what counts as a part depends on its position in the whole.

250
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:27,720
That's the Gestaltist point.

251
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,599
People say the Gestaltist point is that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.

252
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,880
That's not interesting.

253
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,159
That's not right.

254
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,799
So is a heap of bricks more than the sum of a part?

255
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,399
It's a heap, I suppose.

256
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:48,200
But in any case, what the Gestaltists want to say is what it is to be whatever it is, it gets only by the way it fits into the whole.

257
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:56,519
Their kind of example is a note in a melody will be heard as a different note depending on the different melodies it's in.

258
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:03,639
And because it gets its quality of the kind of note it is from its position in the hole.

259
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,080
And you see, you wouldn't even say a totality for that.

260
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:15,039
So, anyway, I may or may not remember to say it, but I think it's something Heidegger certainly, when he says Garn's gonze, he means whole.

261
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,000
So, where are we?

262
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:21,600
I am on 60, on 97, and I'm reading something.

263
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,279
Ah, yeah, okay, let's go back.

264
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,720
Taken strictly, there is no such thing as an equipment.

265
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:34,639
To the being of any equipment, there always belongs a whole, an equipmental hole, I'm going to say, in which it can be this equipment that it is.

266
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,599
Equipment is essentially something in order-to.

267
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,480
The totality of equipment is constituted by the various ways of the inorder-to.

268
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,679
I read that.

269
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:52,879
Now, but it's so hard to understand this, partly because now that I do understand it, I see that even Heidegger can't quite get it right.

270
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:00,160
That is, it's not enough to say that equipment is constituted by ways of in order-to.

271
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:08,159
I love his example because this tree that's fallen across the water can be used in order to get across the water.

272
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,119
It's not that that Heidegger wants to point at.

273
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:18,640
He wants to point out that if it's equipment and not just a tree used to get across the water, then it's got more than an inorder-to.

274
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,759
That's in order, it's more than just in order to get across the water.

275
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,879
It's got to be fitted into a hole of other stuff.

276
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,319
That's part of what it is to be equipment.

277
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,960
Now, it's like, if you think of it, it's just ordinary English.

278
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,279
You just don't, just because you can walk across this tree and use it as a bridge doesn't make it a bridge.

279
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,679
A bridge is a piece of equipment in a whole collection of other pieces of equipment.

280
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:52,079
And Heidegger's very set on that because he wants to show that equipment isn't a substance.

281
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,759
It's not self-sufficient.

282
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,399
It only gets to be the equipment it is in the whole of other equipment.

283
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,599
And that's something that no philosophers have ever paid attention to.

284
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,919
Yeah.

285
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:22,359
Well, at some point, I don't think a trail would be maybe enough, but then signs saying, you know, go slow, and I was putting in some way to go under it if it could be a bridge.

286
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,400
But no, I don't know.

287
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,039
I mean, this is not a kind of question that we can, you know, give any general answer to.

288
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:37,319
It's when something gets to be what it is by how it fits in with the other stuff around, then it's become equipment.

289
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,240
And I think maybe you're right.

290
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,600
It's become already a bridge as soon as you build a road up to it.

291
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:45,000
I won't object to that.

292
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,240
And then it's equipment for crossing roads.

293
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,120
And then it, but it couldn't be a bridge, this is the point, unless it was linked into the highway system.

294
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,720
And that's the Heidegger point.

295
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,279
So you're right.

296
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:00,440
Just build a road up to it, link it in, and it becomes equipment.

297
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah.

298
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:11,399
I think possibly that maybe you're right in the foundation of bridged in the repository.

299
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,639
Like we're kind of trying to stretch it by the long example.

300
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,160
Now I'm just saying the law and okay.

301
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

302
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
There is a third characterization.

303
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,839
Maybe I just sort of blurt out the general rules of this game because they turn out to be so subtle.

304
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:42,039
And this is the cause of, as I say, arguments for years, and I don't even know anybody else who's tried to work it out.

305
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,319
To understand equipment, you've got to understand suitability.

306
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:57,200
And that would mean that it has to have, Heidegger will say in a minute, the kinds of properties, real properties, that make it able to do what it does.

307
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,039
So if it's got to be a bridge, it can't be just sinking into the water when you step on it.

308
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,319
Then that's fine.

309
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,639
Suitability, but that won't get you just equipped.

310
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,799
That only gets you the log across the water.

311
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,639
And then it has to have appropriateness.

312
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,960
That's a different German word, but they get translated the same here, which doesn't help at all.

313
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,840
There is, it's got to be sudden, that's suitable, and ongames, that's appropriate.

314
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,359
Now, what about appropriate?

315
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,839
Well, there are two kinds of appropriate, and that's what he just put his finger on.

316
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,960
There is that it has its appropriate place in the system.

317
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:44,240
And when you think about that, my examples always are that a hammer is suitable for opening paint cans, but it's not appropriate for opening paint cans.

318
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,680
Or more or less fancy.

319
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,319
A chair is suitable to stand on, but it's not appropriate to stand.

320
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,519
Now, but why are there two kinds of appropriate?

321
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,559
One is to be linked into the rest of the stuff.

322
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,759
So chairs are, for cultures where there are tables, they don't work in Japan.

323
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:09,200
Chairs are strong enough to support people who weigh a good deal.

324
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,640
And otherwise, we don't find them collapsing under people and so forth.

325
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:15,759
There's lots, well, that's, by the way, a suitability complaint.

326
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:18,480
Claim they've got to be tough like that.

327
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,879
It's an appropriateness that it's only appropriate in a culture where there are tables.

328
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
Chairs go with tables.

329
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,119
Tables go with floors.

330
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,879
If you have a dirt floor, you're very unlikely to have chairs and tables fitting into that.

331
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,640
Now, but he, who was it that just said this problem to me?

332
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,279
You.

333
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,919
You got me into the third kind.

334
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:51,720
And that is that it's culturally determined by what's the appropriate use of such and such.

335
00:28:51,720 --> 00:29:01,799
So it's not just that it's integrated in with all the other equipment, it's inorder to mixed in with all these other inorder twos.

336
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,160
It's got a kind of sanction.

337
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,119
I went to a lot of trouble, so I'll go find out where I am trying to give me an example of this.

338
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:21,639
Okay, I don't know if this is going to work, but a fork is suitable for stabbing chunks of food and for holding things down when you're carving it.

339
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,319
I'm trying to distinguish forks from chopsticks in my head.

340
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,879
So that's what a fork is, for stabbing hunks of food and holding it down while you're carving it.

341
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,919
The prong thing is not a fork in Asia.

342
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,639
Since to be a fork, there have to be, on a suitability claim, a food that you can hold down and carve up.

343
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,599
And there also have to be knives and plates and so forth.

344
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,519
And the food doesn't have to come in chopstick-sized chunks.

345
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,799
And now comes the norm part.

346
00:29:53,799 --> 00:30:13,240
And you enforce the way forks are used by saying one uses one's fork to eat vegetables, one does not use a fork to eat fruit like grapes, although you could, you know, that took me a long time to think of something you shouldn't do with a fork, but I think that, but, but that seems right.

347
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:24,159
So, so now we've got a level at which what one normally, properly, and the word in here is appropriately, I'm domestic in German, what you have to do with work.

348
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,759
So it turns out to be a piece of equipment, it's got to have three necessary qualifications.

349
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:30,560
Who would have thought?

350
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,000
And not even Heidegger.

351
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,039
He's got it all in here, but he hasn't really thematized it.

352
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,799
But it's got to have, he talks about the suitability conditions, I'll show you that.

353
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,480
He certainly talks about the appropriate, has to fit into the whole conditions.

354
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,599
And he certainly, I'll show you that too, talks about the social norm conditions.

355
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:58,319
And when it has to fill all of those, and he was saying, it's not enough to be a log across the stream, not enough even to build a road up to it.

356
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,679
It's got to be the sort of thing that one normally drives across.

357
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,160
Yeah.

358
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,480
Can't you consolidate those saying these lipids, whatever we want?

359
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,560
Well, that's true too, but I'm not sure it consolidates it.

360
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,960
It just, you could say it, it's, then you don't, we'd have to unpack it.

361
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,240
And why would we say it?

362
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,519
It isn't enough just to walk up to we discovered a log across the water and say that's a bridge.

363
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,320
Well, then they've got roads leading up to it and maybe signs of their sorts.

364
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,200
Paths leading up to it.

365
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,960
They can't have it just out of from sheer jungle to sheer jungle.

366
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,839
They've got to go.

367
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:49,759
They've got to have paths, I think, and then something the equivalent of signs, whatever they use for markers to lead people to it.

368
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,920
I don't want to, I don't think you can do it that way.

369
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,080
I don't think you can just walk up and make something.

370
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,279
At least Heidegger doesn't.

371
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,359
And you're supposed to be checking this against not what Heidegger thinks, but the phenomena.

372
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:09,160
If you think that we can just walk up to something and make it a piece of equipment all by itself or without any social position and something, then we're deviating.

373
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,720
Yeah.

374
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,480
Here's the exact thing.

375
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,839
It's the activity functionality.

376
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:27,640
In order to do something, I'm walking alongside.

377
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,440
I could notice that I fast that there's three.

378
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:48,200
But you get a cost of three, then it seems to me the three of us for me become something with this, but in order to find awkward my promotion.

379
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,639
Okay, that's.

380
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,559
Okay, I see what you're saying.

381
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:06,680
It's true that you can use the stream as the trunk across the stream in order to get across.

382
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:13,880
And that's, and when you're doing that, its mode of being will be the readiness to hand.

383
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:20,200
But Heidegger's trying to distinguish that from a sense of equipment.

384
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,679
Maybe equipment is ambiguous on this.

385
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:23,559
I don't know.

386
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,599
I think maybe he's got it right, sort of.

387
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,159
I wish I had a better feel for Zeug in German.

388
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:36,599
Does it become a Zeug just, or does it have to get a word like spiel or house or something in front of it before it can be a Zeug?

389
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,400
I don't know.

390
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:48,400
But before it becomes equipment for something, for Heidegger anyway, it has to do more than just satisfy your current desire to get something done.

391
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:55,440
That's enough to let you use it in order to, remember I said order to is broader than the holism.

392
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,599
In order to do something, at that point, it's ready to hand.

393
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,680
If you are walking across it and you're using it, it's ready to hand.

394
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,039
But I don't think it's equipment.

395
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:12,240
But remember, I'm not saying that the readiness to hand is a broader notion.

396
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:18,000
It covers the holistic, normative stuff.

397
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,399
When I'm using it, it's ready to hand.

398
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:27,120
And it covers the, you just find it all by itself and you use it without any social categories.

399
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,559
And that's also ready to hand.

400
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,240
You can do that.

401
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,679
I think you can use something to SWAT insects, for instance.

402
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,880
There may not be any equipmental thing around for that in that culture or something, but you can still do it.

403
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,799
Yeah, you will have more to say.

404
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,160
That's okay.

405
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,960
I think I've talked about why the street is equipment.

406
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,519
They're saying that the street is making things, it's probably not.

407
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,840
Exactly.

408
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,880
That's exactly.

409
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,760
Good.

410
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:00,959
You got it.

411
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,120
I'm pleased for you and for me.

412
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:03,679
Okay.

413
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,920
Next, more hands.

414
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,399
Yeah.

415
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:23,039
I suppose if you, I mean, that's got the cultural piece and the suitability piece.

416
00:35:23,039 --> 00:37:09,120
You've got to say that they aren't just what we use to cross streams, but that that involves, if you want to, you don't have to add anything new but you just have to spell out that of course then there'll have to be paths up to them and markers telling you where they are and uh uh stuff like that and then but if then you got it it's all right it becomes equipment uh it uh well just is fascinating this isn't how I picture things going but I don't know I well I'm gonna go just remind me one two three four five and then I'm gonna go on for a while yeah what is the red and reference that will make bridges and people have been making a bridge and it's this kind of stuff like that people walk into the speech bridge and putting on that on the water and saying wouldn't people still say that it's a bridge because it looks like a bridge and has all the topic for bridge people it's not in any bridge it's probably hard to deal with but it's funny I came up with the same example on the actual isn't the London Bridge is now someplace in Texas if I'm not mistaken isn't that right anybody know and it's not and I don't suppose any roads lead up to it or away from it it just sits there someplace in Texas and and and you're asking is it's is it still a bridge uh it's it's and you just have to say it's a former piece of equipment which is no longer functioning like a piece of equipment that she's is that what you want to say too you say it okay that does it okay you're happy with that both of you okay you have another point yeah oh, I was going to add for it if you're talking about intention talking about the regular equipment that we intend to use.

417
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,480
I think the answer is no.

418
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:16,640
I didn't quarrel with him about it because it belongs at another part of the discussion.

419
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:21,359
But I, luckily, we've got the door latch that Heidegger has dropped in here.

420
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:26,239
You are going to use the latch as a piece of equipment, even though you don't intend to use the latch.

421
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,920
What you tend is to go out, and you know may not even notice it.

422
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,239
You may even want to deny there is a latch, and then they have to show you that, look, you couldn't have gotten in if you hadn't turned it, and so forth.

423
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:39,519
So, no, you do not have to intend to use it.

424
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,719
It can be just part of your overall activity.

425
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,480
You have to, as I said, keep saying in my terms, you have to take account of it, because otherwise you won't be able to turn it.

426
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,559
But you don't have to think, you don't have to try to turn it, or want to turn it, or think about believing you have to turn it to get out or anything.

427
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,280
Yeah.

428
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,199
Okay, where's somebody here?

429
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,280
Here.

430
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,519
Yeah.

431
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,440
Oh, an overhead for you.

432
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,440
Oh, yeah, that old thing, yeah.

433
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,640
Right.

434
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,280
Right.

435
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:31,519
Because the media is the outside speaking instead of what my two boards and spot modes are too cool anymore.

436
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,279
Well, you guys are doing Heidegger's work and mine.

437
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,519
I mean, these are all fascinating questions that you just have to look at the phenomena.

438
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:47,920
I mean, he's really trying to be true to your common sense or linguistic, however, you prefer, understanding of this.

439
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,880
Let me think.

440
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,839
Does it cease to be equipment?

441
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:58,319
It's still suitable for if you get it by an electrical outlet and still can plug it in and so forth.

442
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,319
It's, I suppose, suitable.

443
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,519
And it's no longer part of a referential totality.

444
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:12,360
That's his fancy word for this holism, of where it fits with all the other equipment.

445
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,320
I think it's not part of that.

446
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:28,920
I think it's like, it becomes like a hammer in a culture like where the Coke bottle story, like the gods must be crazy, they could have dropped a hammer instead of a Coke bottle out of their airplane.

447
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:37,079
In a culture in which there is no nails and no wood and so forth, and it's not a hammer.

448
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,559
Now, this thing was a slide projector.

449
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:41,559
That's what makes it seem sort of different.

450
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,720
But it was equipment.

451
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:47,079
But it's no longer equipment by the holistic claim.

452
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:49,319
If nothing, there's no screen anymore to show it.

453
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:55,320
And, you know, nobody's got any transparencies to write on and pens and stuff.

454
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,559
It's once upon a time equipment.

455
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:58,679
Of course, there's lots of that.

456
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,480
I mentioned it.

457
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,119
I think archaeologists dig up all sorts of stuff from, you know, it's similar.

458
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:15,239
It would be now like digging up something that you don't if you go far enough, if we go far enough with PowerPoint, people will have to be very ingenious and try to figure out what it is.

459
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,279
You look unhappy.

460
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:26,599
But it does seem taking those analysis the possibilities for overviews.

461
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,960
For tools that are smooth, are possible, are ridiculous, you know, may not be the customer.

462
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,440
Okay.

463
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:41,480
Well, look, you you are what you're saying is fine, but that you've gotta be careful and not get too much into the s the the what?

464
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:48,239
The the queen is whether the distinctions you're making are going to be illuminating in general about equipment.

465
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:56,320
Sure, there will be degrees of equipment, and sure it'll be unclear when they actually dropped out of being equipment altogether and so forth.

466
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,880
But try to focus on paradigm cases and don't worry about these weird borderline cases.

467
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,760
There's always going to be borderline cases in which you just don't know whether something's equipment or not.

468
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,879
But that doesn't matter.

469
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:16,319
What you want to find out is sort of what in the best case is what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for something counting as equipment.

470
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,760
That's what you want to find out.

471
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,360
Then you can make all these little subtler moves.

472
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,480
Now, I said I wouldn't touch anymore, but I can't resist one more hand, and then I'm going on.

473
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,399
Doesn't it prevent us from doing what?

474
00:41:49,599 --> 00:42:05,840
I mean, I can hear you, but I can't understand why would it keep us from referring to it as equipment.

475
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,600
That's not ontological.

476
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:14,239
That's just a, I mean, the being of equipment is ready to hand, and you can refer to that too, but that's a little fancier.

477
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,559
But I don't see the problem.

478
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:35,799
Well, you're using preontological in this funny way, or at least it doesn't help here, because it is all preontological.

479
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,039
Ontology, remember, is the science of being.

480
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:50,839
It's what you get when you understand these ways of being and then you reflect on their general structure and you discover how they're related to temporality and you do all kinds of stuff.

481
00:42:50,840 --> 00:43:00,360
The ontology doesn't d w everybody knows how to handle equipment and you really have an intuition where you're all using it to what would and wouldn't count as equipment.

482
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,160
And that's all pre-ontological and you may never have any notion of the being of equipment.

483
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:09,399
But we're going to go to that right now, because I we've had enough discussion of that.

484
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,320
I just have to run through here though just to catch up in case there's some quote that it would be helpful to give you.

485
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,320
98.

486
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:25,640
I'm just seeing.

487
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,559
No, that's going to be remind me, but well I'll I'll remember when I get to that.

488
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,080
Equipment.

489
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:37,000
So normal functioning.

490
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,639
We did all that.

491
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:40,440
Did I let me see if I on page 97?

492
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,799
I think we did that.

493
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,880
Oh yeah, yeah.

494
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:46,039
Okay, that's fine.

495
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:48,919
Let's oh, I think it's funny.

496
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:58,680
I say that we have to jump ahead to 115 for a good statement of it, but let's see if that's where it is that I want to talk about.

497
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,480
No.

498
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,159
There he's talking about suitableness, serviceability, and so forth.

499
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:14,720
That's a flat passage where all these things come out, but they don't come out any clearer.

500
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:21,840
I mean, he's got, well, maybe I should try the top of 115 in 83 German.

501
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:34,239
Anything ready to hand is, at least, I think, I'm trying to fix it, suitable, that's that, for some purpose and unsuitable for others.

502
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:42,079
And its properties are, as it were, still bound up in these ways in which it is suitable or unsuitable and so forth.

503
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,160
And then serviceability, let's see if they're all like that.

504
00:44:51,920 --> 00:45:01,920
Serviceability is a constituted state of equipment, is not suitable of some entity.

505
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,000
It's rather a condition which makes it possible for the character of some entity to be defined by its appropriateness.

506
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,480
Aha.

507
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:15,199
The switching from suitable there to appropriateness in the sense of reference or assignment.

508
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:16,639
We might as well introduce those terms.

509
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:18,640
They are back in the earlier reading, too.

510
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:25,760
That is the way pieces of equipment have bearing on each other, the hammer on the nail, the nail on the wood, and so forth.

511
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,920
And that's fine.

512
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,359
Now let's go to the end of it.

513
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,719
An entity is discovered when it's been assigned or referred to something.

514
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:39,120
That is, you discover what it, you, you, you know what, you have a know-how for what to do with it.

515
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,920
And it's referred as that entity which it is.

516
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,600
There is an involvement it has in something.

517
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:51,199
Okay, no, that's just filling it all out with jargon that we need to know.

518
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,000
Let me see if there's anything else.

519
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,679
So I've got these examples, which I'll run through quickly because we've done them already.

520
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:13,719
Now, I was saying a hammer used as a weapon wouldn't be suitable to bask people, but it's still a hammer.

521
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:14,920
It's not a weapon.

522
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:24,600
It's a hammer because it's got this appropriate place in the referential totality as a weapon it doesn't have.

523
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,320
And a chair and so forth, we said that.

524
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,119
Okay.

525
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,920
Look on 67.

526
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,039
I think that's one of the places that I wanted to refer to, or maybe it's important.

527
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,839
Maybe, oh, 67 is German.

528
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm doing that wrong again.

529
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,519
Now, where am I?

530
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,440
Now I don't even see where I got 67.

531
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,320
Okay.

532
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,639
Because I turned the page wrong.

533
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:00,519
Here we are.

534
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:04,600
It's on 67, it says.

535
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,879
That's crazy.

536
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,920
I don't know what happened there.

537
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,960
I can only mark it and go back and try to find out.

538
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:17,880
But it's so, I think it became clear in that discussion already, and I don't think we need to look at it anymore.

539
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah, let's go on to the next thing, which is how we relate to equipment.

540
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,360
That gets us to taking it up and using it.

541
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,640
That's an important distinction, which I didn't see for a long time.

542
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:44,640
So, and now, so that's about readiness to hand.

543
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:47,679
And now we want to find out where I am and to talk about that.

544
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,639
Okay, on 98, 69 of the German.

545
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,080
So, now you see, I mean, there's nothing very mysterious about this.

546
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:02,960
So, you get it as a piece of equipment, like a hammer, and then you pick it up and use it.

547
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:10,880
Its way of being can be like a substance if it's just lying there present.

548
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,920
Ooh, that's interesting.

549
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:16,959
It's still holistically defined.

550
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,640
I wonder if it can be present as a hammer.

551
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,039
No, I think it's present as a wooden shank with a blob.

552
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:33,359
I don't think it can be, it'll cease to be a hammer if you try to isolate it.

553
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:42,480
And it's always going to have to be involved with, I mean, have bearing on other things to be a hammer.

554
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,240
Okay, so there's something there.

555
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,080
It has bearing on other things.

556
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,880
You pick it up and you use it.

557
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:55,519
When you use it, then its mode of being becomes readiness to hand.

558
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,119
Its mode of being before you pick it up and use it.

559
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,240
Back in this argument I used to have with Rick.

560
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,600
It doesn't seem, it shouldn't be.

561
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,760
Ah, yeah, that's how it comes out.

562
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,920
Okay, the crucial passage where I win.

563
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,880
Poor Rick, he isn't here to defend himself.

564
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:28,080
But anyway, where I thought that I was showed to be right is that it's not enough to just pick it up and have it in your hand for it to become ready to hand.

565
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,799
And what does it take to become ready to hand?

566
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:40,759
Well, it has to, and there's this crucial passage now I have to find, withdraw in order to be ready to hand.

567
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:44,840
Uh-oh.

568
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,279
So, but now I can't find that.

569
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:00,200
This is what happens if you do things in the order in which they don't regret it, in the order in which they come up.

570
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:03,880
But then I try to get back to where I am and I don't know where I am.

571
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:11,080
Okay, I'm just going to go through this in readiness to hand way, and then we'll get there eventually.

572
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,960
I'd say we need to distinguish the definition of equipment, and that's what we've been doing, to its mode of being, its kind of being that equipment has.

573
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:29,640
And it can have all sorts of kind of being if it's just lying there or if it's in a culture in which it doesn't, it has no function.

574
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:34,760
But what about its mode of being when it's functioning as equipment?

575
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,760
Then you get the talk about readiness to hand.

576
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,600
And a lot of this talk is on 97.

577
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,759
I think I read that all.

578
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:49,319
Yeah, that's where reference and assignment, by the way, first comes in.

579
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,920
In the in order to, as a structure, there lies an assignment or reference of something to something.

580
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,840
It's just important to talk about that.

581
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,039
I'm going to use the definitions, I mean, those words.

582
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:02,200
I don't think they're very good words.

583
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:05,240
Assignment is probably bearing would be better.

584
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:07,559
It's the it's and reference.

585
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:12,200
The the nail, the hammer has bearing on the nail.

586
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:15,280
Then that's its reference.

587
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:21,119
And a referential hole would be all the bearing that all the various pieces have on each other.

588
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,119
But reference isn't bad.

589
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,120
It just sounds sort of linguistic.

590
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:35,119
And assignment sounds too much like you've done something conscious in it, whereas the nails just look like to be hammered, and the door looks like the two go out.

591
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,760
You don't have to assign a function to it.

592
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,480
I don't know what I would say instead of assignment there.

593
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,600
Let me think.

594
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,199
I forget the German, so I won't be helpful until I went back and looked at it.

595
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:50,639
So let's go on.

596
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,159
Each piece of equipment has only one function, and that's fine.

597
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:55,519
It fits with all the others.

598
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,559
That's fine.

599
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,680
Procreatively means socially.

600
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,079
Okay, now we're back to readiness to hand.

601
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:24,960
And readiness to hand, the way of the being, is the way of being of equipment when it's functioning as equipment.

602
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,720
And that is when you actually have it in hand.

603
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:30,879
And you're doing something with it.

604
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,920
You're handy with it.

605
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,200
You've got the skill and you're employing the skill.

606
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:40,640
All that is in the notion of its being ready to hand.

607
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:42,880
This is in the middle of 98.

608
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,960
I'm back where I was on 69.

609
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,639
Yeah, this is the crucial passage.

610
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:55,120
In dealing, this is about 10 lines down in the first full paragraph.

611
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,920
In dealings such as this, where something is put to use, do we have to back it up?

612
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,039
Maybe we have to read the whole paragraph.

613
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:03,879
Equipment can genuinely show itself.

614
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,920
Yeah, that's important.

615
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,720
We're asking now: how does equipment show itself as equipment?

616
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:13,960
It shows itself only in dealings cut to its own measure, hammering with a hammer.

617
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,119
But in such dealings, an entity of this kind is not grasped thematically.

618
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:20,519
That's the door latch story.

619
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,759
Nor is the equipment structure known as such in the using.

620
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,480
That's a little bit of a preontological story.

621
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:32,519
It's all preontological and reflective.

622
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,360
Let's see now.

623
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:43,000
The hammering does not simply have a knowledge about the hammer's character, but it has appropriated this equipment in a way which could not possibly be more suitable.

624
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,039
That is, when you're employing your skill for hammering.

625
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:48,360
That's what we need to be talking about.

626
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:56,039
In dealings such as this, where something is put to use, our concern subordinates itself to the inorder to.

627
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:01,559
That means you just are doing something, like going out the door.

628
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:06,440
What is constituted for the equipment we are employing at the time?

629
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:13,239
Sorry, we subordinate ourselves to the inorder to, which is constituted for the equipment.

630
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:15,799
That is, remember, that's how it fits in the hole.

631
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,880
That's how it bears on other stuff.

632
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,239
We are employing at the time.

633
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:25,000
Now comes the crucial line that used to just fascinate me, but I've gotten used to it, but I still think it's fascinating.

634
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:38,360
The less we just stare at the hammer thing, and the more we seize hold of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more unveiledly is it encountered as that which it is, as equipment.

635
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:52,159
That's this interesting phenomenon that Heidegger's got in mind: that the more you just are absorbed in using the equipment for what it's for, where it's in order to, the less you experience it at all.

636
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:58,080
It doesn't have any properties, those are all invisible to you.

637
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,240
It doesn't have anything.

638
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:13,039
I mean, the perfect use of the, when you're really using equipment, well, say driving your car, you're just or wearing your clothes or typing away at your computer, it becomes invisible.

639
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,000
That's what ergonomics is supposed to do with your interaction with equipment.

640
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,360
It's supposed to make it not something that you have to notice or pay any attention to at all, but you just take account of it.

641
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:37,120
The famous example that I think Merlot-Ponty and Wittgenstein used, so I don't know any lecture where Heidegger uses it, though he may probably, is a perfect example, is a blind person's cane.

642
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:44,239
You can picture that cane, if you hold it and feel it, it's smooth and it has a certain weight and it has a certain length.

643
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,760
Those are all properties of it as it's present at hand.

644
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,080
But it also is equipment for getting around in the world.

645
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:58,559
And when you take it up and use it as equipment, of course, at first it doesn't work very well.

646
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,280
All you feel is bumps in the palm of your hand.

647
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:09,039
But eventually, you get so you feel the world at the end of the cane, so they say, and I'm sure that that must be right.

648
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:17,359
And you don't feel, you don't have to figure out from the bumps in the palm of your hand when you're hitting the curve or how far away it is, or how high it is.

649
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,640
All that you get.

650
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:24,799
And you don't, and it isn't as if the, and this is something I'm just putting aside, it isn't something that interests Heidegger.

651
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:31,399
But it's not as if you interpret the bumps unconsciously, that it doesn't have, there aren't any bumps anymore.

652
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:37,879
Your body has just sort of taken over the cane, and your sensibility is out there at the end.

653
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:46,920
How the brain can do that is a story that nobody understands very well, but it's no reason, there's no reason to think that you do it by interpreting anything.

654
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,079
So, anyway, so what's the important thing?

655
00:56:49,079 --> 00:57:00,360
That when you're using equipment, the better it's more and more ready to hand, the more and more it is transparently functioning.

656
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,880
And that's when he introduces ready to hand.

657
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:11,559
He says on that page, the kind of being which equipment possesses and which it manifests itself in its own right, we call readiness to hand.

658
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:21,800
Now, the funny way to put that is the way it manifests itself, we've just argued, is to be invisible.

659
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,599
And that's a funny kind of manifesting.

660
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:33,959
But the pain manifests itself when the guy is feeling the curve or when your clothes aren't bothering you.

661
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,319
But let me just read one more thing.

662
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:42,519
A cross on 99 from where we are on 98 is an important way to do it.

663
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,880
Say this.

664
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:54,280
That which in our everyday dealings we dwell, that which in our everyday dealings we proximately dwell is not the tools.

665
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,239
On the contrary, that which we concern ourselves is the task or work.

666
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:11,000
That which is produced at the time, that means that when the hammering is going well, I'm looking for the phrase, I can't find it.

667
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,840
I've always assumed it was here.

668
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,039
I know it's around.

669
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:19,519
Anyway, when it's working well, equipment withdraws, is how you're looking for this.

670
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:21,119
Where?

671
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:21,920
I can't see it.

672
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,840
That's right in front of my eyes.

673
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:26,400
The first full paragraph.

674
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,680
On 99.

675
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,719
Ah, the second full paragraph.

676
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:33,279
Aha.

677
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,480
Now let's read it and see.

678
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:35,440
Oh, yeah, there it is.

679
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,559
How could I not see that?

680
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:44,960
The readiness to hand is not grasped theoretically at all, nor is itself the sort of thing that circumspection takes approximately as a circumspective theme.

681
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,960
That is, it's not part of what you look around and see as part of the context.

682
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:59,120
The peculiarity of what is proximally ready to hand is that in its readiness to hand, it must, as it were, withdraw in order to be ready to hand quite authentically.

683
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:08,880
Okay, that's meant to be my answer to anybody who says that the hammer in a drawer has the way of being of readiness to hand.

684
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,200
It doesn't have it at all.

685
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:15,519
It's something you could look at, but it isn't transparent.

686
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,440
It can't withdraw.

687
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:29,280
It's only when you've got it in your hand and it's become transparent that the being of the equipment is fully, genuinely, authentically ready to hand.

688
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,640
Before you take your hand, let me just relate this to what we were saying earlier.

689
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:51,519
And you see, the funny thing is, you could have it in a drawer in a culture in which there isn't any nails and isn't any wood, and you could pick it up and you could transparently use it to pound your tortillas or something like they tried to do with the Coke bottle and the gods Must Be Crazy.

690
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:56,079
It would still be genuinely ready to hand, as I understand it.

691
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,160
It would withdraw, and so that you can bring, you can take these two things apart.

692
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:06,120
The being of equipment depends on its place in the referential hole.

693
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:14,680
That is, that means to be a hammer, it's got to have a place in the referential hole.

694
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:23,480
But the being of equipment, when you're using it as equipment, has to be withdrawn and invisible.

695
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,640
You're just making it part of your body and your activity.

696
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:33,160
Now, having tried to sort that out, as I never have got it before, yeah, go ahead.

697
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:40,519
Ah.

698
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:44,120
Huh.

699
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:52,919
That's fascinating.

700
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,039
That's interesting.

701
01:00:54,039 --> 01:01:02,360
That should argue that, in a way, the clock, when it's functioning to tell you the time, is invisible.

702
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:08,759
It would be, I don't know how to do it, to answer you very well when you hear it.

703
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,519
But take this as an example.

704
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:21,719
Thoreau has this great example, which he doesn't use in this way, but it's an example of how the Campanile clock becomes, in a fact, transparent to its function.

705
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:29,000
He asks the question: Are there Roman numerals or Arabic numerals on the Campanille clock?

706
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,440
Anybody know?

707
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,119
What did I say?

708
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:35,079
Roman or Arabic?

709
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:36,120
You think they're Roman?

710
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:38,359
I think they're Roman too, but I'm not sure.

711
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,679
And are they tilted or are they vertical?

712
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:42,039
I mean, look, you don't know.

713
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:43,559
No, but we've seen it ages.

714
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:45,359
I mean, I've seen it for 30 years.

715
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,360
You've seen it for, anyway, a few years.

716
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,159
You don't know.

717
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,200
And that's why.

718
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:49,840
Why?

719
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:52,160
Because it functions to tell you the time.

720
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,519
And when it does that, you pick that up and the rest of it just is invisible.

721
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:01,039
If you didn't know what it was for, you'd know a lot more about it.

722
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:07,440
You could describe what these numerals were, probably.

723
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,559
But just because it's functioning, you don't have to see the, you don't see these properties.

724
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,640
Now, what happens when it rings?

725
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:15,760
I don't know.

726
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,000
It's as if you somehow don't hear the ringing.

727
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,119
The idea would be that you didn't hear the ringing, but you just came out knowing that it was whatever it was, 12 o'clock.

728
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:26,879
I don't know how to describe it.

729
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,559
But let me take your general point.

730
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:39,039
There's lots of equipment that we don't pick up and use or see, and it doesn't become invisible, but it does its job anyway.

731
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,279
All kinds of equipment.

732
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,240
I mean, the stuff that keeps the water cold in the water cooler with its thermostat and all that.

733
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:50,880
That's all into a big referential totality.

734
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:53,679
And it's functioning as equipment.

735
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:55,119
Whoa, another distinction.

736
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,720
You've got to distinguish between functioning as equipment and being used as equipment by somebody.

737
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:05,920
And Heidegger, that just shows how complicated the structure of worldhood is.

738
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,519
And he doesn't care about that one.

739
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:16,400
I mean, he could, but what he wants to do is understand the way of being of equipment when you are using it.

740
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:26,559
And he doesn't have a word, he doesn't have a concept for the way of being of equipment when it's functioning and you're not using it.

741
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:31,159
I don't, it's certainly not present at hand, not ready to hand, not unready to hand.

742
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:40,760
A while ago, one side of the right side, another sound.

743
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,840
Let me see what it is.

744
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,960
By the long one.

745
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:44,440
Okay.

746
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,000
Okay, but when the but when things are okay.

747
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,519
Well, except that when is the question is a hard one, though.

748
01:03:58,519 --> 01:04:02,280
When is the refrigerator's way of being ready to hand?

749
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:08,440
Because for that, it has to be sort of in your hand and withdrawn.

750
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:10,280
I mean, like the hammer.

751
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:12,840
Oh, I see.

752
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,400
It's okay.

753
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,639
It's I see it's functional.

754
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,320
Uh-huh.

755
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,039
So I see.

756
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:24,839
So it's withdrawn when you're relying on it and it's doing its job and you aren't experiencing it.

757
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,320
That counts as its readiness to hand.

758
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,240
I think that's probably right.

759
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:34,039
Let me so that's because would Heidegger have any problem with that, I'm asking myself.

760
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:36,519
So here we got this two Handen Heiden.

761
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:39,160
Now you don't have to have the hand in there.

762
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,119
That's just an accident of the German.

763
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:47,960
And so readiness to hand really means we don't have any word for it.

764
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,759
John Hoagland has available.

765
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:56,200
I think that's wrong because the hammer in the drawer is available, but you're not using it.

766
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:14,000
Anybody got a word for the what what how this equipment is to be named when it's doing its job and it's uh uh fitted in the hole and it's uh f making something happen that you are uh depending on.

767
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,360
And yet it's not, and it's sort of withdrawn, that's what you're saying.

768
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,800
And so we just want to say it's ready to hand, period.

769
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,519
Okay, why not?

770
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,799
Okay, I'm ready.

771
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,440
I'm convinced.

772
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,079
I'm convinced.

773
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,439
We'll say it's ready to hand.

774
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,119
So the answer is there's lots of equipment around that's ready.

775
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:36,959
I have to revise my story.

776
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,440
Lots of equipment around that's ready to hand, even if it isn't in your hand.

777
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,960
But it does have to have the quality of withdrawing to do its job genuinely.

778
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:52,159
If you're noticing its properties and stuff, that's because something's not doing its job.

779
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:53,920
It's breaking down.

780
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,480
Yeah.

781
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,960
And in that way, I don't think that it's so much with frost.

782
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,159
But say the dual of the refrigerator, although it's something out of the refrigerator, is withdrawn.

783
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:15,279
So I don't think we can separate by using something as equipment that is completely withdrawn and that it's putting the raise of hand.

784
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:28,159
There's something that seems more, when we're talking about using something as equipment where it's withdraw, by exciting, no longer interacting with the equipment at the concert.

785
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:29,360
That's right.

786
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,399
Right, right.

787
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:46,639
Well, yes, but all I want to say to that is you can get a beer from the refrigerator in a zombie-like state while you're watching some television or thinking about things.

788
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,319
And then that's the level Heidegger's interested in.

789
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:54,880
When you're really already thinking about it, you're already, you could deal with it that way.

790
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:01,159
Then either, then it's a bunch of present-of-hand things like cold and which shelf is it on and stuff.

791
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,359
That's all right.

792
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:15,399
But I think Heidegger wants to say at the rock bottom of the level of relating to equipment, even refrigerators, they become invisible and you just get what you want out of them.

793
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:19,639
That may be, you know, again, complications we don't have to worry about, that there's some equipment.

794
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,319
Oh, Heidegger does worry about it.

795
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:22,439
Good old Heidegger.

796
01:07:22,439 --> 01:07:25,880
You could say, I'll prepare you for what you're going to read next time.

797
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,039
But think of it, I won't even tell you the answer.

798
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:36,279
Is there any kind of equipment that in order to do the job that it's doing has to become visible and noticed?

799
01:07:36,279 --> 01:07:38,279
I mean, certainly that won't fit the refrigerator.

800
01:07:38,279 --> 01:07:40,840
I'm putting in the refrigerator sort of aside.

801
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:44,359
And he thinks there is, and he thinks it's very interesting.

802
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:47,159
And you're going to read about it next time, and you'll be surprised.

803
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:49,319
I bet most of you, I wouldn't have thought of it.

804
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,039
Yeah.

805
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:04,759
How would Heidegger feel about the claim that one thought might be the epitome of a withdrawal?

806
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,079
Good.

807
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:09,719
One thought.

808
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:10,679
Right.

809
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,239
Okay.

810
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:11,720
I see.

811
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,039
Well, I thought that crossed my mind.

812
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:24,359
Merleau Ponty says that the cane has become part of the blind man's body, because Merleau-Ponty thinks of the body as the sort of my coping capacity.

813
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:32,599
And Heidegger has two sentences in Being in Time about the body, in which he says it's a very complicated subject, and I'm not going to deal with it here.

814
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,880
And leaves the job to Merlot-Ponty, which is nice.

815
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,519
Only he didn't know he was doing that.

816
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:46,159
But in any case, it's we-our body is certainly not a piece of equipment.

817
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,199
I mean, we agree about that.

818
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:53,679
You don't use your hand like you just pick things up the way you might use a pair of pliers or something.

819
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:58,639
But your body does seem to be transparent when you're coping.

820
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:11,039
And I don't think Heidegger would mind, but if you had to have a way of being for the body, I bet Heidegger would say that when you're using it and getting around in the world, it's ready to hand.

821
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:18,880
And it's a way of being, and when, of course, you're being operated on for the doctor, it's just a present-at-hand piece of meat.

822
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,599
But it can show up in both those ways.

823
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:27,759
I don't know whether he'd get in trouble thinking that we would get in trouble thinking the body is ready to hand or not.

824
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:31,119
But I see lots of people who have some issues on their mind.

825
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:32,079
Yes.

826
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:38,639
Want to say that again?

827
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,439
That's big enough to have a faith handling.

828
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,000
I can't.

829
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,680
Oddly enough, I can't hear you.

830
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,960
You're talking too soft or something.

831
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,399
I just don't, or for me anyway.

832
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:57,279
Say it again loud.

833
01:09:57,279 --> 01:09:57,760
I'm sure.

834
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,960
Can you hear him?

835
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,559
Everybody, no, they can't hear you.

836
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,679
So say it again.

837
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,720
Oh, you can replace one hammer with another hammer.

838
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,559
I'll repeat for the people on the podcast.

839
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,199
Okay.

840
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,760
No, you can't replace your body with another body.

841
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,439
That's a very important difference.

842
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:16,159
Right.

843
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:16,639
Okay.

844
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,039
But it could still be that the way of being is the same.

845
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:25,920
I don't understand we don't have enough criteria for what counts as the same way of being or not.

846
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:33,559
Or we don't know enough about what's the essential thing about the body and whether it turns out to be the same as the essential thing about equipment.

847
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:40,599
I don't want to talk about body just because it's very interesting and complicated, but since Heidegger says nothing about it, it doesn't belong in this course.

848
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,639
I promise to give Meryloponte within the next two years.

849
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,519
Yeah.

850
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,599
The mode of being an equipment when it's not in use.

851
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:06,039
I think that, well, now you're asking me to repeat this thing, which is so hard, and I'm still getting used to it, but I think it's helping me a lot.

852
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:15,960
Its mode of being in the referential totality being a hammer is what?

853
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,880
I still haven't got it.

854
01:11:18,439 --> 01:11:19,559
Heidegger hasn't got it.

855
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,760
It's not my fault.

856
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,679
Heidegger thinks, Heidegger thinks that if you had to give it a mode of being, it would be ready to hand.

857
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,079
But why am I reluctant to say that?

858
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:34,039
Because it's only genuinely ready to hand when it's invisible and withdrawn and you're coping with it.

859
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:36,039
So it shouldn't be ready to hand.

860
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:37,399
That's wrong.

861
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:43,639
On the other hand, you can't say that when it's being a hammer, that it's present at hand, an isolated substance with properties.

862
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:48,840
Remember, I banged into this once already in the course of this lecture and stunned and didn't know what to say.

863
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,679
And I still don't know what to say.

864
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,799
I think Heidegger's got a big deal problem.

865
01:11:54,439 --> 01:12:03,880
I think he's going to have to stick it into the category unready to hand, which is what happens to ready-to-hand things when they stop being invisible.

866
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,679
So a hammer that's too heavy gets to be unready to hand.

867
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:15,439
Unready to hand is going to have to be the sort of extra mysterious category to put this stuff in.

868
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:21,760
And Heidegger makes it hard because he doesn't even spend much time on ready to hand, on unready to hand.

869
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,880
Let me just show you 102 where it comes up, but it's just barely in your reading.

870
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,960
But it's important.

871
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,239
He talks at the bottom of 102.

872
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:45,119
When we concern ourselves with something ready to hand, we meet something unusable, not properly adapted, the tool turns out to be damaged, and we could add yours maybe just lying around.

873
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,960
In each of these cases, equipment is here ready to hand.

874
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:59,439
But we discover its unusability, however, not by looking at it and establishing its properties, but by the inspection, the circumspection of dealings in which we use it.

875
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:05,599
When its unusable unusability is thus discovered, equipment becomes conspicuous.

876
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,159
Conspicuous presents the ready-to-hand equipment in a certain unreadiness to hand.

877
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:12,399
Boy, is he, I swear it's him.

878
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:14,159
He's very confused.

879
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,599
He doesn't know how to describe this equipment.

880
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,000
And he, oh, this is going to drive you crazy.

881
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,279
It drives me crazy.

882
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:29,439
He thinks that unreadiness to hand, the way he's going to use it, is some kind of subcategory of the ready-to-hand.

883
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:30,639
That's what he's doing here.

884
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,719
That's what he does every once in a while.

885
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,640
And I'll see if I can show you at the bottom.

886
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:42,559
The conspicuousness presents the unready to hand in a certain, sorry, the ready to hand in a certain unreadiness to hand.

887
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,880
And let me go a little further and sort of.

888
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:51,519
And then the German says, the German is bad there.

889
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,319
We get all kinds of trouble.

890
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:53,760
Heidegger's not very clear.

891
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,119
I'm not very clear.

892
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:56,800
The translators got it wrong.

893
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:18,519
So the second sentence on 103, where he says it shows itself as an equipmental thing which looks so-and-so, the German is, and which, in its availability, which is readiness at home, it was also constantly occurrent as looking thus-and-so.

894
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:32,679
So, what you see, what he says is when something stops being transparent, you see that, and this is what seems so crazy, it was already looking as so-and-so at you.

895
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:46,439
What you want to really say, so getting it out of into the good English doesn't help any, it wasn't constantly occurrent as looking so-and-so while you were transparently using it.

896
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:53,319
But it was constantly there having certain properties that made it suitable for you to use it.

897
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:58,920
It's just that you weren't seeing it that way, it wasn't looking so-and-so.

898
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:07,800
But there is a kind of murky thing here that Heidegger needs to talk about when things are conspicuous.

899
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,760
Who raised the question?

900
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:18,359
Was it oh, yeah, but the kind of conspicuousness would be something that was lying around that wasn't functioning, but then you're asking a bigger question.

901
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:22,119
You're saying, but suppose it's just lying around, you aren't even trying to use it.

902
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:27,399
That's if you're trying to use it and it's not functioning, it lies around conspicuously, it is unready to hand.

903
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:33,239
But lots of stuff just lies around, like the slide of the famous slide projecting thing.

904
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:40,279
And I don't know what's its character, as long as there's equipment around that makes it, that it's still in.

905
01:15:41,479 --> 01:16:02,159
Let's say it's still equipment, but it's neither, I'm not, my relation to its way of being can't be just present at hand, because it's in this holism, but its way of being can't be readiness to hand, because I'm not coping with it, and it's not withdrawing because it's doing its job.

906
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:14,239
It's either something we don't have a name for in Heidegger, just equipment sitting around, or if it's getting in the way in some way, then it's unready to hand.

907
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,479
Yeah, you want to follow up on that?

908
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:19,760
What is that?

909
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:22,399
Latently ready to hand.

910
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:26,399
Yeah, but that's just a kind of fudge.

911
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:28,000
I mean, I mean, that's true.

912
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,840
That describes the phenomena.

913
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,799
But its kind of being is that you could use it.

914
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,800
Its kind of being is that it could, it is equipment already.

915
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,319
Remember, we got that distinction.

916
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:46,799
But that, but it's kind of being is that you could, you use, you're using it.

917
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,800
This idea of the kind of being is that you could use it, well, that's okay.

918
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,519
Then we need a new name for it, because then we couldn't say it withdrew when it did that.

919
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:01,439
So I'll take it latently, potentially ready to hand.

920
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:02,239
What else can I do?

921
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:03,599
It's the only word I've got.

922
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,960
Okay, yeah, you back in the.

923
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,039
I can't hear you very well, but when you're actually using it, it is ready to hand.

924
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:22,319
It's invisible, and that makes it ready to hand.

925
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:27,359
Oh, I see.

926
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:31,239
That's just a bad thing about the translation, but it's interesting that you go in a...

927
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:36,199
It shouldn't, I mean, Zuhanden in German has not, it doesn't have any readiness in it.

928
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:39,159
It's just to hand.

929
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,679
It's important that it's not just on hand.

930
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,319
It's on hand or in hand if you're looking for prepositions.

931
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:49,399
But the ready doesn't do anything.

932
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:52,600
And neither does the hand, really, because most of the time you're using equipment.

933
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,479
You don't need your hands.

934
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,800
You can use equipment like this, for instance, that doesn't need my hands.

935
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,359
Yeah.

936
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:01,880
Passive?

937
01:18:02,199 --> 01:18:05,319
Well, that's when it's lying around, conspicuous.

938
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:07,800
That's what he wants to call potentially ready to hand.

939
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,000
You've got too many questions.

940
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,800
The last one.

941
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,039
Well, no, I wanted to hear from him first.

942
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:14,359
You had your hand up, and then I'll hear from you, and then I run.

943
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:14,760
Yeah.

944
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,800
That sounds kind of a description.

945
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,719
He explains how he thinks it is.

946
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:27,799
But he doesn't really have your arguments for why, like, it is that.

947
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:29,239
Okay.

948
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:38,199
Well, because that's wonderful to say that, because we're doing phenomenology, and he's asking you what I'm asking you.

949
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:39,960
Check it against your experience.

950
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,399
And you're all playing the game.

951
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:45,639
And you're saying, yeah, but I got experience of this, which doesn't fit into that definition.

952
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,119
But I don't see any place for arguments.

953
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:58,920
You either can solve, if you're a phenomenologist, your everyday experience right here and now, or if you're a linguistic philosopher, you go and you try to understand how we talk about it.

954
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,119
But we don't really have arguments for this.

955
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:03,159
Last point.

956
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:11,720
I agree with you to make the hand with ready to use when you are actually using ready to handle the point of readiness.

957
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,519
There isn't my.

958
01:19:13,079 --> 01:19:13,559
Okay.

959
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,319
Ah.

960
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:21,039
Oh, boy.

961
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:23,519
Okay.

962
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:26,159
So it could have, I like that.

963
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,199
It could have Stuhanden height.

964
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,279
The height is the readiness part.

965
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:40,000
It could have readiness to hand, but the readiness to hand is not genuinely revealed or experienced unless you pick up and transparently use it.

966
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:43,119
I like that.

967
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:47,760
Let me repeat it again because it's new to me and I want to make sure it's somewhere I can hear.

968
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,559
So if readiness to hand would be what he called potential ready to hand.

969
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,239
I think he was on the right track.

970
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:55,759
And you're on the right track.

971
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:08,800
And then readiness to hand becomes sort of activated as experienced as readiness to hand when you're transparently using it.

972
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,479
Then it is most genuinely ready to hand.

973
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:18,000
The readiness to hand is most genuinely ready to hand when you pick up this thing and use it.

974
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:18,399
Good.

975
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:20,159
Stop with that while we're ahead.

976
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:20,799
Okay.
