1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,519
Now, back to the question, two questions, which we're going to get answered in the chapter on the one.

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,919
One of the questions is: what's the ultimate source of intelligibility in the world?

3
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:17,359
And the second is, who are you?

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,239
Who is each Dasein person?

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,439
And we're going to find out both these things.

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:32,400
And I sort of jumped in and talked about all over the place last time, which was fine, except now I want to do it more systematically.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:45,120
So, starting with the who question, which is on 163, that's how he gets into it, though he doesn't come back to that until toward the end.

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:55,719
But he starts with, on 163, let me see where we are.

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:09,880
The ontological relevance of our Dasein being with, which is where he begins on number 27, German 126, page 123.

10
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:27,480
The ontologically relevant result of our analysis of being with is the insight that the subject character, remember he's always got to get rid of the subject, the subject character of one's own Dasein and that of others is to be defined existentially, that is, in terms of certain ways in which one may be.

11
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:34,040
In that with which we concern ourselves environmentally, the others are encountered as they are.

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,959
They are what they do.

13
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,280
So I keep saying that every once in a while.

14
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,120
This is one of the places he says it.

15
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,639
Later in Division II, he says, one is what one does.

16
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:48,439
That's obviously what you can say once you've got the one thing in there.

17
00:01:48,439 --> 00:02:01,959
And I also wanted to give you the punchline, if I could get it right this time, from when I started to say what the people say across the universe, the father says to the son, why don't you do something?

18
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,239
And you are what you do.

19
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:13,079
And the son says, no, what you do depends on who you are.

20
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:19,639
And Jude, who was listening in on this, says, it's, you are how you do it.

21
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,720
And that's a very Heideggerian answer.

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:37,840
You know, that's like talking about the ultimate for the sake of which, in which I said, you can't say that somebody just is a role that they're performing, and you can't say they're just the totality of their actions.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,360
And their identity turns out to depend on how they're doing their role.

24
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:52,720
So it's not, I can't just be the sum total of Burke Dreyfus's actions, and the ultimate for the sake of which just being me.

25
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:57,600
But it's not enough just to be a professor, or not enough even to just be a teacher.

26
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,120
So there's got to be this third thing, and this is Division II talk.

27
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:07,919
But since I got that story and I was trying to remember the punchline, and I found somebody who did, I thought I would just tell you.

28
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:39,119
So you turn out when you look at it in Division II, you are the special way that you take over some role which you have to have to give intelligibility in order to, you have to have an ultimate for the sake of which, and the for the sake of which is the how you take how you take over and perform that whatever public intelligible role you take up, I think.

29
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,200
Anyway, that was just filling in.

30
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,440
Now we have to go on to the stuff I have to cover today.

31
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:52,640
To begin with, I jumped in without telling you, but you may have discovered it for yourselves, presumably.

32
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,600
This is a very, very confused chapter.

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:16,480
It's very original in some ways and very important to make lots of sense of things, but Heidegger's got two different views going at once, which he doesn't distinguish very well, and which he actually sometimes, I'll show you, goes back and forth between them within a single paragraph.

34
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:21,720
I think I already mentioned this last time, but I think it's just important to say it again.

35
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,280
And whether one is he's getting from Kierkegaard, in which the one turns out to be very bad.

36
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,520
There's a negative story to tell about the norms and about conforming.

37
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:58,199
And the other, I don't know whether he gets it, but you will recognize it if you've had any Wittgenstein, which is a positive view that it's the shared practices which are the source of intelligibility, and it's a positive fact about the way we are, that we've got these shared practices and they form the background of all that we're doing.

38
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:08,679
And it's as if Heidegger has sort of understood and even extrapolated both of them, but they're in complete opposition to each other.

39
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:21,239
And yet, and this is why it's so interesting, it's true that there are these two totally different opposed understandings of the role of the practices.

40
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:31,079
And the only way to make sense of it is not to sort of wallow around in the confusion, but to keep your eye on the phenomenon.

41
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,239
And when you do, you'll be able to understand, and this is how I'm going to organize it.

42
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:44,440
There is a neutral subject, namely the role of norms and conformism as essential to Dasein.

43
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:52,999
Then there is a negative account of how that can lead to conformism, and that's bad for Dasein.

44
00:05:52,999 --> 00:06:01,359
And then there's a positive part that that can be the basis of all intelligibility, is the basis of all intelligibility.

45
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,359
And he's got to hold on to all of that.

46
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:17,200
And all you have, and he says, just, and I'm going to read it to you at the end because it's the last thing he says, is, well, don't worry about the fact that we've got no good ontological way of characterizing all this.

47
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,040
Just hold on to the phenomena.

48
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,799
That's what you have to do.

49
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,759
I'm always saying that, but in this case, it's even more important, and that he's saying it.

50
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,759
And with that, you can sort of find your way through the confusion.

51
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,520
Okay, so number one, the neutral phenomena of norms, mostly what I talked about last time.

52
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,640
It coordinates my activity.

53
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:49,999
I am what I do, and I do what one does, and that's running, always running through whatever he's saying.

54
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,560
Why am I telling myself to look at this?

55
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,879
Well, I see the middle of 155, another place where he says this kind of thing.

56
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:18,480
The end of the first full paragraph, German 119, Dasein finds itself proximally in what it does, uses, expects, avoids, in those things environmentally ready to hand with which it is proximally concerned.

57
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,680
That's this, you are what you do, one is what one does.

58
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:32,640
This is so much important part of getting rid of the idea that Dasein is a self or a subject or an ego or consciousness or anything like that.

59
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,520
It's Dasein is a whole, is whatever a Dasein's activity adds up to.

60
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:57,239
Okay, now the and the thing I mentioned last time, which I want to repeat just because it's so interesting and important, is the slyness, and that's his word, of the one, the norms.

61
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:09,160
And this is on 166.6 where he uses the term, the beginning of the second full paragraph in German 128.

62
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,280
Of course, the one is as little present at hand as Dasein itself.

63
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:21,240
The more openly the one behaves, the harder it is to grasp, and the slyer it is, that the less it is nothing at all.

64
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,080
What's the phenomena there?

65
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,520
Well, it's the same as the nearest and farthest away.

66
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,840
It's right in front of our face, so to speak.

67
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,880
It's all over the place, everywhere.

68
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:45,640
And that's how, and it's that, and that makes it so sly and hard to grasp, like the goldfish, like the water to the fish.

69
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,679
But it's also, you could be more specific.

70
00:08:48,680 --> 00:09:00,279
I mean, it's not just another case of something that withdraws to do its job, which it is, but that you can see it, sort of how it works and withdraws.

71
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,759
And this was my example of distance standing.

72
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,359
It's right in your face.

73
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,280
You're doing it all the time.

74
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:15,560
You couldn't get you know get along if you didn't have this complicated skill for how far to stand from people when you talk to them and interact with them.

75
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,999
But you don't notice it.

76
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,680
Your parents didn't notice it.

77
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,439
Nobody actually taught it to you in the sense that that they couldn't because they wouldn't have been able to tell it to you.

78
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,560
They didn't know it.

79
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,680
And secondly, it's much more subtle and complicated than anybody's ever been able to figure out.

80
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,159
There's a field, I don't think I mentioned it, called proxemics in anthropology.

81
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,680
Apparently, I haven't studied that field, whose business it is to study distance standing.

82
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:42,639
How near?

83
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,920
Proxemics.

84
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:49,200
And they try to write the rules for it, but the rules are for any culture.

85
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,560
But the rules turn out to always be more complicated and extrapolatable in other situations.

86
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I told you how near you stand could depend on whether the other person has the flu or whether there's an air hammer making a lot of noise in the background or whether you're standing in a reading room, library reading room.

87
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,680
And you have a skill for getting all of that, getting it right, where getting it right means where you and the other person feel comfortable.

88
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:27,200
And you do it all without in perfect coordination and reach the point where everybody feels comfortable and it's right there happening in front of you and it's totally sly, you don't see it, but it's directing your activity.

89
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
That's a neat point.

90
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,600
Heidegger certainly got it right.

91
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:50,799
And so I got another example I didn't mention where you don't have to be trying to do it or thinking about it in other cases where people get on an elevator and given how many people there are, they distribute themselves in a certain way that seems to work, in which everybody feels at home.

92
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:59,280
They don't all get together or bunched up in one corner against each other, except unless there are a lot of people in the elevator, and which, of course, then they do.

93
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,280
And that's all, they could feel that and work it out.

94
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,760
And it only shows up in breakdown cases.

95
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,680
And what would be a breakdown case?

96
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,039
Well, John Searle's got this wonderful example of the best kind of breakdown case.

97
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:41,480
He says, if you look, you'll see at international, say, philosophy congresses, any kind of international congress kind of meeting, that the people from, how does he say, the people from Scandinavia are, no, the people from North Africa are backing the people from Scandinavia into the corner because the people from North Africa are trying to get near enough to have a conversation, and the people from Scandinavia are trying to get far enough to have a conversation.

98
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,480
And their different distance things just clash.

99
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,999
And then you might become aware of it because it's breaking down.

100
00:11:51,320 --> 00:12:22,119
So, and now we've got a name for this: ontological existential characteristic that people are always governed by the norms and led to do without even noticing it what one does, and that's called distantiality, or abstandischkeit, at the bottom of page 164, German 127.

101
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,720
The one has its own ways in which to be.

102
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:42,200
The tendency of being with, which we call distantiality, and then that's a good translation of Abstandisch, is grounded in the fact that being with one another concerns itself as such with averageness, which is an existential characteristic of the they.

103
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,960
That's not a very perspicuous definition.

104
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,679
He's got an, because it sounds like you're paying attention, concerning yourself with it.

105
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:59,080
You don't concern yourself with how you get distributed in elevators or how far you stand from people.

106
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,480
So let's try the top of 164.

107
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,880
Maybe it'll do better.

108
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,759
I don't remember.

109
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:16,320
The care about this distance between them, like in distance standing, for instance, but it also could be any other distance more metaphorical, where you how far you deviate from the norms.

110
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,600
The care about the distance between them is disturbing to being with one another, though this disturbance is one that is hidden from it.

111
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
That's the slier again.

112
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,800
If we may express it existentially, such being with one another has the character of distantiality.

113
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:39,359
The more inconspicuous this kind of being is to everyday Dasein in itself, all the more stubbornly and primordially does it work itself out.

114
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:45,040
That's a better, I think, notion of it, though it sounds like he's defining it at the bottom of the page.

115
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,520
He's not defining it very well.

116
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,960
But distantiality is the name for what?

117
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:59,120
The pressure, you have to say, not concern again, but this fly, how does he put it?

118
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,480
Inconspicuous pressure to conform to the norms.

119
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,960
That's distantiality.

120
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,800
And that kind of inconspicuous pressure isn't a kind of intentionality.

121
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,240
That's important.

122
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,960
That's why it's so hard, as he says by the end of the chapter, to find any way to talk about it.

123
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,840
I mean, it isn't if you try to get the right distance from people to have a conversation with them.

124
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,720
You just do it.

125
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:44,240
And so this constant pressure to perform doesn't lead you to have the intention of doing such and such.

126
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:54,279
It doesn't lead you even to have this more primordial kind of coping that you have when you're an expert at things and like with the familiarity in the room.

127
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,120
So that's much closer.

128
00:14:57,239 --> 00:15:00,280
You're taking account of it all the time.

129
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:17,320
And it's forming the background of all of your activity without it ever having to be something conscious that you're trying to achieve as a goal or even something that you are just directed toward as some achievement.

130
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,760
It's just something that you are led to do.

131
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,040
And that's the way it works.

132
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,759
And it manifests itself.

133
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,080
I mean, again, what's the phenomenon?

134
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,560
Well, mostly it's invisible.

135
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,000
So there isn't any phenomenon.

136
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:37,879
It's withdrawn.

137
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:55,399
But if it manifests itself at all, it manifests itself as, and I'm not going to do distance standing, but generally, this pressure toward inconspicuous conforming to the norms becomes conspicuous when you start worrying about what the neighbors will think.

138
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:05,720
I mean, my mother, particularly, I think, I don't know if it's now, maybe that was mother's in the 50s or something, I don't know, was always worrying about what the neighbors would think.

139
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:15,319
And if we didn't mow our lawn that week and it got longer than everybody else's lawn, that would be a bad thing because the neighbors would think we were, I don't know, reckless or something.

140
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,720
And it was always like that.

141
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,840
I mean, once I remember asking her why she always put the shades down.

142
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,839
We lived on the first floor in a ranch house.

143
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,519
And she said, well, the neighbors, what would they think if they saw that we didn't have time to make the bed that day?

144
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:40,799
Well, there is a norm, and you better conform to it, and there are all these neighbors watching to make sure that you conform to it, and you will be sensitive to that.

145
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
That's the phenomena, I think.

146
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,960
Now, that leads to the negative form.

147
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:56,799
Up to now, I've been talking about the neutral form, except for the neighbors, which is already beginning to be a conformist issue.

148
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:02,319
But up to the neighbors, I meant to stop and say that's the neutral description.

149
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:11,440
It's sly, it governs everything you do, it's inconspicuous, it's making what you do sharedly intelligible.

150
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,919
That's just that's it.

151
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,239
Now, but now the negative form.

152
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:31,919
This is where he suddenly switches over as if somehow the word averageness at the bottom of 164 triggered something in him, which is reading a lot of Kierkegaard, and he goes mad against it.

153
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,480
How awful this business, this concern with averageness is.

154
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,720
I'm saving it till the end.

155
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,480
But if I don't get there, remind me, but I will, because there's the, but just not to be mysterious.

156
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I said it already last time when he says the one articulates the referential totality, but I can give you some phenomena for that later.

157
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:10,799
But here he is going completely mad against averageness at the top of 165, about four lines down, still 127 in the German.

158
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:21,239
In this averageness, with which it prescribes what can and may not be ventured, it, the one, keeps watch over everything exceptional and thrusts itself to the fore.

159
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,839
Everything exceptional means the German would be better outstanding.

160
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,520
I mean, that's the idea.

161
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:39,319
I mean, anybody who's doing anything special that is, you know, gets sort of pushed back to doing the norm, what is the normal thing.

162
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,999
Every kind of priority gets noiselessly suppressed.

163
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:46,680
Priority ought to be something like superiority, I think.

164
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:54,200
The German word for that outstanding is forun, which would be being ahead.

165
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,319
Every kind of priority gets noiselessly suppressed.

166
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:02,359
Overnight, everything that is primordial gets glossed over as something that has long been well known.

167
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,960
Everything gained by a struggle becomes just something to be manipulated.

168
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,400
All this is true, too.

169
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,680
That's the amazing thing.

170
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,639
It's not that he's suddenly lost touch with the phenomenon or is just raving.

171
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:28,359
He's just looking at the same phenomena from a different angle now and seeing that the tendency toward norms and averageness, which is just something neutral and necessary, has this bad consequence.

172
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,720
So every secret loses its force.

173
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,359
This care of averageness reveals in turn an essential tendency of Dasein we call leveling down.

174
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,799
That's the, if the translator knew Kierkegaard, he would just call it leveling.

175
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,720
It's a Kierkegaard term.

176
00:19:45,720 --> 00:20:01,920
Leveling is exactly what Pete Kierkegaard doesn't have a name for the one, but in his book, The Present Age, if you want to read more about this, in this little book, The Present Age, Kierkegaard is talking about the way everything gets leveled.

177
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,319
And he happens, for his own reasons, to be blaming it on the press.

178
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,599
But that's, you could say now the media.

179
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:19,759
I mean, part of all this averageness, leveling down, everything that's really been interesting and one becomes common knowledge and people think they knew it all along.

180
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,159
That all the media's business.

181
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,440
But of course, you get it in all other, a lot of areas too.

182
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,360
It isn't just in the media.

183
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,720
But Kierkegaard is very unhappy about the media.

184
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,880
And Heidegger just takes over leveling.

185
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:46,559
So distantiality, which is neutral, averageness, which ought to be neutral, and leveling down, which is certainly them, as ways of being for the one constitute what we know as publicness.

186
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,440
That is also a word from Kierkegaard.

187
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,759
Kierkegaard talks about the public.

188
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,119
The media is really speaking for the public.

189
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:03,039
And the public is, well, there's a place where Kierkegaard says there's no truth in the crowd.

190
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:15,680
The public has always sort of covered up everything that's really interesting and important for us into this banality, the standard way of doing things.

191
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:26,079
And it's constantly, remember I said, co-opting or coercing or repressing all the deviations, some of which are no doubt crazy.

192
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,880
But I didn't say that last time, but that's obvious.

193
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:37,919
But some of which are very important, original stuff that somebody like Heidegger has worked hard to work out in his book.

194
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,839
And people will say, oh, that just, that can't be right.

195
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,879
That's not how one thinks about it.

196
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:53,159
So he says, Publicness proximally controls every way in which the world and Dasan gets interpreted, and it is always right.

197
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,680
That turns out to be a very interesting and important sentence, because now I have to make a digression.

198
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:05,239
Sort of, how many are reading about this stuff in my commentary?

199
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Oh, needle, middle.

200
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:20,999
Anyway, in my commentary, in case you ever read it, and for those who read it, I go completely wrong and off the rails at this point because I didn't, I don't know, I just wasn't paying attention.

201
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:24,680
I only paid attention to that little bit of that sentence.

202
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,960
I mean, in the context, obviously, that's not something positive.

203
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:38,999
But I said, ah, yes, look, Heidegger thinks that publicness are the norms, and the norms control interpretation.

204
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:42,839
And they are the basis of all intelligibility, and they're always right.

205
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:48,999
I mean, it's always right to pronounce Gloucester and not Gloucester.

206
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:55,720
It's always right to do all the right pronunciations, and that's good, otherwise you wouldn't be able to understand each other.

207
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,919
And it's right to eat food with a fork in our culture and with your hands in Morocco.

208
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,800
And of course, it is kind of like a pun.

209
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:07,320
Driving, you're always on, you have to do what's right.

210
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,480
In our case, always drive on the right.

211
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,359
And it's a good thing that there's some way that one drives, otherwise, it'd be disaster.

212
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:25,080
So I thought, aha, he's got this important idea that the norms are tell us the right way to do things.

213
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,480
And if it weren't for that, we wouldn't know what to do.

214
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,159
And because of that, we've got an organized world.

215
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:50,799
And I thought, aha, he's flipping in this passage at that point from his Kierkegaardian railing to what he believes from his Heideggerian, sorry, from his Wittgensteinian, which he doesn't know, but I mean, Wittgenstein-like belief in the positive powers of the norms in the background.

216
00:23:50,799 --> 00:24:01,440
And then a lot of people wrote sort of that there was something wrong with my commentary because I didn't do Division II and that there you and that, oh, let me know, I have to say a little more about it.

217
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:11,680
In fact, wait a minute, I've got to give you guys this part, find my lecture, which is somewhere in here.

218
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:22,399
I wrote some notes for myself about this, and I have to see that I do it in the right way, the part of getting how I got it wrong and how you shouldn't get it wrong.

219
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,200
Okay.

220
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:48,640
No, I don't know what I was looking for here, but anyway, so what, oh yeah, people said I didn't understand that in Division II that Heidegger showed something was wrong with Division I and that I couldn't write a commentary just on Division I because it would be wrong in some way that I would realize if I had added Division II.

221
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,399
So I thought that might be right.

222
00:24:50,400 --> 00:25:04,799
But what was peculiar is in all the reviews, nobody ever said what it was that was wrong about Division I if you just wrote, what does Heidegger take back that he said in Division I, in Division II?

223
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,920
And I couldn't find anybody who knew.

224
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:14,039
And it looked to me like Division I was right from beginning to end, and that Heidegger thought it was, and if he was taking something back, he would have said so.

225
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,960
And so forth.

226
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,440
But there is an answer.

227
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:21,880
There is something, and this is exactly the place where Heidegger is saying something.

228
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,039
Or no, sorry.

229
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,320
Heidegger is saying something which is only half the story in Division I.

230
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:37,960
He's not making a fuss about it, but you do have to complete it with Division II, or you get the wrong view.

231
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,320
Okay, what's the wrong view?

232
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,599
The one I just gave you.

233
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:56,999
What Heidegger is saying here is that the norms are either a big disaster, which I just read, or that they are, after all, the source of intelligibility, and in a certain way, they are always right.

234
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:01,880
And the, and I went now, and I'll let you where I went wrong.

235
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:13,160
I mean, what I got wrong was I took from this sentence in isolation the idea that Heidegger thought that there was no higher intelligibility than everyday intelligibility.

236
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,039
That's a big, I think that's it, I think Wittgenstein thinks that.

237
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:24,039
I think that it's an interesting thesis, and in a certain way, it's got something right.

238
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:36,359
But Heidegger thinks that there is a higher intelligibility that goes against the average standard banal intelligibility of the public.

239
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,919
And he goes on about it at length in Division II.

240
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:55,799
And I can just tell you sort of briefly, without your having to know all of Division II, that the higher intelligibility turns out to be a kind of mastery of the culture, in which he gets it from the phronymous.

241
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,960
I mentioned Phronymus last time, I think.

242
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:06,639
He has a lot to say about the person of practical wisdom in Aristotle, who does the appropriate thing at the appropriate time in the appropriate way.

243
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,119
Now, that's interesting, because that's, in a way, what you could say about what one does.

244
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:27,440
But one Dasman, the one, the public, the average, does just the normal, average, appropriate thing, at the normal, average, appropriate time, in the normal, average, appropriate way.

245
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Whereas the man of practical wisdom and the authentic Dasein, which is what he's talking about, does the uniquely appropriate thing in this particular situation, in his appropriate way, or her appropriate way.

246
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,999
And that's the higher intelligibility.

247
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:56,720
To be able to see in a situation what the normal people don't see, whether it's original and primordial, maybe that is more basic and more appropriate.

248
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,879
And that's what I missed.

249
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,440
And I missed it because I did see something.

250
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,839
Certainly, Heidegger doesn't believe in any metaphysical higher intelligibility.

251
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,239
There he is, like Wittgenstein.

252
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:28,079
It isn't as if there's, like in Plato, the ideas, which are more intelligible than everyday intelligibility, or Descartes, science, which is more intelligible, or Husserl doing his kind of phenomenology to get us at the real level of the meaning-giving organization of everything.

253
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,599
Heidegger doesn't believe in any of those metaphysical things.

254
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,960
There isn't any higher source of intelligibility than the one.

255
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,159
So it's a very tricky.

256
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,519
You don't have a higher source of intelligibility.

257
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,239
And in a certain way, the one is always right.

258
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,599
And yet, there's another sense in which the one is always wrong.

259
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,400
And if you just stick to the phenomena, you can see what that means.

260
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,079
There's a sense in which the normal way of doing things is the right way of doing things.

261
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:28,519
And there's another sense in which the normal way of doing things covers up the more, what are his words, the outstanding, the primordial, and so forth, original, et cetera, way of doing things, which is there, but only the very skilled masters of the culture who are authentic and who are not sort of sort of making life easy for themselves by just doing what one does, only they will see it.

262
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,879
Okay, so Han.

263
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,119
Wait, first.

264
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,079
Yeah, go.

265
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,039
Oh, you don't.

266
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,079
You're going to wait?

267
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,200
Okay, David.

268
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,759
Well, that's a it doesn't sector's knowledge that they're hiring dignities at all.

269
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,079
That's right.

270
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,200
It does.

271
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,519
That's right.

272
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:50,920
Good.

273
00:29:50,920 --> 00:30:03,800
Yes, leveling levels by not only not seeing that there's this unique way, but in fact actively denying it because it's comforting.

274
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:11,960
Heidegger says tranquilizing and disburdening to think that there is all you have to do is know what the neighbors think and you'll know what to do.

275
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,799
That's the sense in which there isn't any, go back to that.

276
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:24,999
I mean, it isn't as if my mother is going to try to figure out some better way of mowing the lawn or maybe not having a lawn or anything to find out what you should be doing.

277
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:29,480
In any case, you just ask yourself, well, what would the neighbors do or approve of?

278
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:39,120
That's leveling, and that's, as you say, denying that there is any, could be, any better way of doing things than the way one normally just does them.

279
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,480
That's what you think.

280
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,360
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
That's the danger of publicness.

282
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,519
Yeah.

283
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,679
They don't have immediate theme in terms of what's probably already in there.

284
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:53,200
Yeah, that's right.

285
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:06,559
And then the fronomist, the person of practical wisdom, the authentic individual, quoting later Heidegger, later, meaning Division II, responds not, see, everybody responds to the general situation.

286
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,879
They do the normal, standard thing.

287
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:19,039
And the authentic Dasein responds to the unique situation, the concrete, particular situation, and does something that is, in effect, surprising.

288
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:34,880
Though not, so not so surprising that it's like, as I said last time, you could just go out and roll on the ground, but surprising in a way that it will later, Heidegger didn't talk about this, but it can later become part of the normal way.

289
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:44,639
But then, of course, it's been leveled out of its appropriateness to the concrete situation, and it's become some standard thing to do in some standard situation.

290
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,400
I get you, you look like maybe you're not happy that I didn't get what you really were trying to say, is that right?

291
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,319
Yes, and that's what yes, right.

292
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,399
And the exception is gotta, and where is this exception going to come from?

293
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:18,759
Well, in Heidegger, anyway, it's gonna come from just becoming more of an expert at the very practices of the culture than anybody else, which enables you to do this more refined and superior thing.

294
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:36,440
I mean, the the frontimus in Aristotle, which is his model, hasn't got any special access to calling from God, for instance, like in y like you can in Kierkegaard and do something really amazing because nobody's ever had this nice calling anywhere like Abraham had to go out and murder his son.

295
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,360
And this is pretty far out.

296
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,919
That's not a frontimus-like thing to do.

297
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:48,200
It it is not it is not even the most exquisitely appropriate thing to do at the appropriate time and the appropriate way.

298
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:55,800
So so you but Heidegger thinks all you need is just sort of better intelligibility.

299
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:01,320
That's what I missed because and that's what most people don't even notice that Heidegger's got this interesting problem.

300
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:16,519
How do you stay in the one, have no source, not God and not the good and not and and so forth, of any other kind of intelligibility and still have a higher intelligibility that is what being leveled by the public.

301
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,600
That's what I'm trying to explain.

302
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,079
Okay.

303
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,400
Yeah, Ty when you're first yeah, he yeah, he said no.

304
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,999
Okay, go ahead, yeah, Tyra.

305
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,360
Why is the rare fashion with the time will be the concept.

306
00:33:51,360 --> 00:34:00,440
I mean, then you think they will realize that preventing themselves have not faced us of intelligibility?

307
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,320
I don't think so.

308
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:03,599
I don't either.

309
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,039
I mean, I thought you were defending that.

310
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,480
No, there is no basis.

311
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,719
There is nothing but no, it's not just a formal difference.

312
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,160
It's a crucial difference.

313
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,160
There's no principle.

314
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,999
There's no word from God.

315
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:21,600
There's no getting out of the temporal into the eternal and contemplating the good.

316
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,719
There is just becoming better at being good in your culture than other people.

317
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,679
You become, maybe it helps excite bourgeois.

318
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,480
Do you know bourgeois?

319
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,400
You become a cultural virtuoso.

320
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,480
A cultural virtuoso isn't somebody that's got access to some other realm of intelligibility.

321
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,320
They just do the culture better than the normal people do the culture.

322
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,999
And the normal people think the cultural virtuoso is a deviant of some sort that needs to be shaped up.

323
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:59,599
But the cultural virtuoso is really doing something that is a better expression of the sort of tendency of the style of the culture.

324
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:02,640
That's how Heidegger sees it, and Aristotle.

325
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,799
But let me, by the way, I didn't expect at all to spend so much time on it.

326
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,719
Now I've got to tell you where it is, at least, so you can at least see it.

327
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,719
We'll help me find the guilt chapter.

328
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,879
Oddly enough, it's in the guilt chapter.

329
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,720
I won't tell you why.

330
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,279
It's only a page or two.

331
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,480
Heidegger gave whole courses on phronesis, and it's typical.

332
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,760
Here we are, on 346.

333
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,319
And it's very, very relevant, so we might as well look at it.

334
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,400
In German, it's on 299.

335
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:45,760
So he's talking about what he calls the situation in italics at the end of the first, at the top paragraph.

336
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,400
And what is the situation?

337
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,799
There you go.

338
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,760
You see the situation through resoluteness in it and so forth.

339
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:05,800
Okay, and the situation only really is understandable as, and I'm trying to find if I can find the best existing.

340
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:10,600
All I can give you that's helpful is the bottom of 346.

341
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:15,880
For the one, however, the situation is essentially something that's been closed off.

342
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,840
The one knows only the general situation.

343
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,679
It's only in contrast to that that you can understand what the situation with a capital S is.

344
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:29,080
He never says the unique situation or the concrete situation.

345
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,120
I said that.

346
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:46,600
But if you see what the structure of it is, then you see that the one responds in the standard way and does the okay, normal thing, and that's understanding the general situation.

347
00:36:46,599 --> 00:37:00,999
And whatever words you have for this other person who does what is outstanding, that is different than, and in a better way, different than, that's what I'm calling responding to the unique situation.

348
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,120
We haven't lost each other.

349
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,919
And that's a higher intelligibility.

350
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,080
So now back to the middle of 165.

351
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:18,280
Publicness proximately controls every way in which the world and Asian gets interpreted, and it is always right.

352
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,359
Now, that is not a Wittgensteinian claim, as I thought it was.

353
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,480
Look at that.

354
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,519
The practices tell us what's right, and that's what is right.

355
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:37,039
And if you just go on with the paragraph, you can see he's still railing against the leveling of the standard way of doing things.

356
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:58,640
Because he says, not because there is some distinctive and primary relationship of being in which it is related to things, or because that is, that is, it isn't as if the publicness has sort of got at the real truth about things, or because it avails itself of some transparency on the part of Dasein, which it has explicitly appropriated.

357
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,759
Hmm, I wonder if that's the front of us.

358
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,880
Just a second.

359
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,039
Something distinctive.

360
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,480
Let me think that's not because there's an interesting clause which I never noticed before.

361
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,079
That refers back to the response to the unique situation.

362
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,240
So he's saying, yes, it's always right.

363
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,759
I mean, this is not, I'm not saying I'm, I'm just giving more evidence for my view.

364
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm not disagreeing with myself.

365
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,160
I mean, he's saying, yeah, the public is always right.

366
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,480
Why is it always right?

367
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,760
Well, it's not always right because it's got at a better, clearer understanding of human relationships.

368
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:44,640
It's not because somehow it sees transparently, that is, deeply, into the nature of Dasein.

369
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:50,640
Those would be what makes the authentic person right.

370
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,400
But it's always right.

371
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,999
Now comes what I didn't read and didn't see stupidly.

372
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:04,480
It's always right because it is insensitive to every difference of level and genuineness and thus never gets to the heart of the matter.

373
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,279
Well, boy, that's not a Wittgensteinian claim.

374
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:28,999
That's a very Heideggerian, interesting claim that there is a more higher intelligibility that gets at, has a deeper sense of what's going on, what the possibilities are in the culture, and a mastery at doing the appropriate thing, and that's it.

375
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,679
By publicness, on the other hand, go back to that again.

376
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:38,280
Publicness has no understanding of what is genuine and outstanding and original.

377
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,519
Everything gets obscured and has been covered up, gets passed off as something familiar and accessible to everyone.

378
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,039
That's leveling.

379
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:59,400
Everybody knows what the normal, appropriate thing to do in the normal situation in the normal way, and that covers up the possibility of doing something special.

380
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,079
You look like you want to say something.

381
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:01,880
Yeah.

382
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,879
Yes, wait, wait, yeah, you're going already, but you just jumped ahead of where we are.

383
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,920
I mean, that's actually, it's on 167, as you said.

384
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,120
Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, you're right, we're going to get there.

385
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,999
So, anybody else?

386
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:30,760
I mean, if, yeah.

387
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,560
Okay.

388
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:47,239
What giant appropriate is that you're speaking about individual translutes, I'm sort of that orients that's appropriate to the economic development.

389
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,400
Well, that's a good question, but Heidegger's trying.

390
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,039
I mean, you're all on the right track to try to understand this.

391
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:15,360
Heidegger's trying to tell you this almost sort of inconceivable idea, and I'm just repeating myself, that there's a higher intelligibility truer to something or other than our normal intelligibility, but there isn't any other intelligibility than the intelligibility of our shared norms.

392
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,640
How is he going to do that?

393
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,239
Well, there's a hand up there, and then I'll come.

394
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,440
I haven't answered you yet.

395
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,160
Yeah.

396
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:40,799
Regarding that as well, this might not be what Heidegger would say, but thinking about it, I wonder if being an authentic person or having that higher intelligibility has to do with, at least a loaded term, but has towards an understanding of the human condition.

397
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,320
And I think as an example, I think of like inventing a new article.

398
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,279
Like someone, some genius comes along and invents a totally new style of creating art.

399
00:41:51,360 --> 00:42:07,440
And everyone thinks they're great, but whether obsolete or just inclusively, the person creates the form of art realizes that it's still emotionally evocative and so forth, still tells something, still behaves the way you are, but still there's likely to be the way art.

400
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,960
Okay, let's stop there because I just said lots of interesting things.

401
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,599
That is, that's what you're saying is a perfectly possible thing to say, but it can't be Heidegger's thing to say.

402
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:25,679
And why, and you sort of said that when you introduced it, that it wasn't maybe, it's absolutely anti-Heidegger because it's anti-existentialist, so to speak.

403
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,600
There isn't any human condition.

404
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,840
There is these very abstract existential structures, but they don't tell you what to do.

405
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,799
But I can transform your remark into one that Heidegger would like.

406
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,160
It's not the human condition, it's the cultural style.

407
00:42:40,159 --> 00:43:02,519
But there is something there that's shared by the people, and they haven't got a very clear, deep understanding of it, but the artist can bring out aspects of, so to speak, what the cultural style would be at its best or something, and that's going to be like this other thing, except without the human condition, I think.

408
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:03,079
Yeah.

409
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:04,600
Yeah.

410
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,279
Ah, yeah, it's fascinating.

411
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,799
Heidegger, Heidegger has no answer to that, and he knows he has no answer to that.

412
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:30,600
And he thinks that that's a wrong kind of question, something like why is there something rather than nothing, which he talks a lot about and thinks that if you think that there's some answer to that, you're still thinking in a metaphysical sort of way.

413
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:32,519
He has a sort of answer.

414
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:41,560
Now I'm going to jump into division, into later Heidegger, and say something pretty incomprehensible and for all I know also indefensible.

415
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:44,519
We get more light on it, though, but I don't think it's going to help.

416
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:52,279
Heidegger says that it's the German word is Eridnis.

417
00:43:53,240 --> 00:44:10,439
What's going on in the culture and why it has a style and why that style has a kind of depth which the artist or the phronomist can live out of is because it's sent by Eridnis.

418
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,039
And now, clearly, it's not sent by any kind of God.

419
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:16,600
Heidegger doesn't believe in any kind of God.

420
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,760
But Arignus is going to tell you something deep about the practices.

421
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,080
Well, nobody that I know has a very clear idea about that.

422
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:37,039
But one of my favorite TAs says that Heidegger does talk a lot about logos of gathering.

423
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:56,160
And what's really, what Heidegger may be saying is that the bottom line is that our practices have a tendency to gather, to become richer, more refined, and bring out things more and more in their possibilities, something like that.

424
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:57,279
That's the bottom line.

425
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,840
Why do our practices gather like that?

426
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,720
That's a kind of mysterious gift.

427
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:04,559
And how many know Derrida at all?

428
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:06,879
It helps to see what would be the denial of it.

429
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,239
It would be to say, no, the practices don't gather, they disseminate.

430
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,719
Things get less and less organized.

431
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:33,599
But Heidegger's picture would be to take my old TA's example: in a kind of fishing culture, the distinctions of kinds of fish, the kinds of bait, the kinds of weather that you can get, which kinds of fish, and when and where you eat which kinds of fish, more and more gathers around the fishing business.

432
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,199
That's how our culture works.

433
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,400
It doesn't spin off into endless disconnected stuff.

434
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,880
And another view you could have of how the practices work.

435
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,799
And then that's, remember, that's going to have to be the bottom line, I think, for Heidegger.

436
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:59,920
Foucault thinks that the practices work by getting themselves into sort of knots, problems, and then have to find out some way of redefining things so as to get out.

437
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,880
So problematization is Foucault's word for it.

438
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,200
Dissemination is Derrida's proposal.

439
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:21,159
And gathering or eridness, which gets translated that something like appropriation, things getting more and more appropriate, is the answer.

440
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:23,559
It certainly doesn't, you've got to be very careful.

441
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:46,120
Hey, it's not going to give you any kind of ontological in the old sense or no kind of supreme being, whether that be the good or the transcendental ego or God, is going to come in, or human nature either, can come in and give us an answer to this, which means that it, let me go on because this is just the next line, it's very disturbing.

442
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:49,480
What you are all trying to do is to make it less disturbing.

443
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,720
It would be nice if the practices were somehow grounded in, oh, another one is rationality.

444
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:00,120
Maybe ultimately there's a more or less rational way of doing things.

445
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,680
Or as he says, maybe it would be more or less true to human nature.

446
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,679
Or, of course, you could try to be true to the will of God, whatever.

447
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:12,039
But Heidegger thinks, no, no, this is just like Wittgenstein.

448
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:14,360
I know this is just what we do.

449
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:20,920
But he does think that what we do can be, we can do it more or less with more or less refinement.

450
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,719
Let me help with one more way to put it.

451
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,360
The cultural master is just another form of expert.

452
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:41,719
Experts or masters are always better at doing something than anybody else in a way that a lot of other people won't even be able to see or recognize.

453
00:47:41,719 --> 00:48:12,560
Whether you're a master violinist or whether you're a master chess player or whether you're a master basketball player, whatever you are a master in, you get there not by knowing some sort of secret thing about that practice that other people don't know, but just by having enough skill, enough dedication, enough lack of satisfaction with where you are, enough sort of anxious suspicion of everybody else's way of doing things, and just keep doing it.

454
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,759
And what happens is you learn by your mistakes.

455
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,880
That's very important.

456
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,639
I'm not talking Heidegger anymore, I'm talking sort of Dreyfus theory.

457
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:27,999
But I mean, you learn by your mistakes and taking risks and discovering what works and what doesn't work.

458
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:35,120
And you do that whether it's chess or whether it's tennis or whether it's music or whatever, or philosophy.

459
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:43,680
You learn and gradually you get better and better and get a more and more refined sense of the situations in which to do what and what.

460
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,760
And where in this situation everybody thinks it's the same as that situation.

461
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,480
You thought it was the same and you did it and you got burned, you made a mistake, you suffered.

462
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,439
Now you distinguish situation from situation B and you do what's appropriate in A when it's A and B when it's B.

463
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,999
And you can get better and better in A, B, C, D.

464
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:10,640
And gradually you've got this amazing spectrum of situations that most people don't even see, and you respond to each one appropriately.

465
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:12,800
Then you're a master in that domain.

466
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,039
And the front of us is a master in the domain of living in that culture.

467
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:17,439
Yeah.

468
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:32,559
That sounds good, but I think the question that needs to be asked to what divides, what causes something to work in the top work.

469
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:43,519
And see what maybe I'm like trying too hard to large words together, but it seems like it might be possible, because Heidegger accepts both a physical reality and psychical reality.

470
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,480
Although he doesn't have a physical reality to underline more basic than.

471
00:49:49,320 --> 00:50:04,360
It's set up maybe what I decided to call new vision, like those psychological realities about ourselves, might be considered part of that physical reality, that sort of plays and what the existential reality.

472
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,240
Okay, I'll tell you Heidegger's intuition against that.

473
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:16,120
I mean, that's a perfectly sensible proposal, but Heidegger's going to have this very typical existentialist cultural relativism about it.

474
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:20,360
What in one culture works in another culture isn't going to work at all.

475
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,879
And that's not because human nature is different.

476
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,640
It's pretty much the same.

477
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:31,639
It's because what counts as working is part of the function of the style of the culture.

478
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:35,080
And there's no reason something works or doesn't work.

479
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:36,440
It just does or doesn't.

480
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:46,200
I mean, either given that culture that you and the other people after you've done it feel good about it and think, wow, we would never have thought of doing that, but that does seem to be a good thing to do.

481
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:50,200
But that's, I've got to keep stressing the difference between him and me is very important.

482
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,399
He wants some kind of ground.

483
00:50:53,400 --> 00:51:00,680
He wants some kind of explanation about why these distinctions are the right ones, good ones to make.

484
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:06,280
And Heidegger's going to resist, like Wittgenstein, any sense of ground.

485
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,120
And that's going to, in Heidegger jargon, you're not at home in the world.

486
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,039
And your nature is that you take a stand on your being.

487
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:20,759
That what coming into my mind is a sort of proverbs.

488
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:37,840
The difference between supposedly our way of looking at things in the Japanese w one way is that we've got a proverb that the squeaky wheel gets the oil, and that means that somehow if you're better at understanding the squeakiness and the oil and so forth, you're going to get master at that.

489
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,480
And the Japanese proverb is the nail that sticks out gets pounded down.

490
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:44,639
That totally opposite thing.

491
00:51:44,639 --> 00:52:02,080
And there, the more you can become part of the group and reach a consensus in which everybody together sees that this is the way the appropriate way to go, that's going to be what makes that the right way to go.

492
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:11,519
And in a culture in which everybody's an individual and you can make more of a fuss and get more attention than everybody else, then that's going to look like the right way to go.

493
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:18,240
And there is, but there's no higher level position from which to say which is right.

494
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,359
I was going to get to this.

495
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,160
So we will, I let me see where we are.

496
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:42,240
Because this lack, in Heidegger language, we are never at home in the world, which is partly because there's no grounding that settles anything for us, except we just have we just can go do something better and worse without knowing why or how to justify it.

497
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,880
There are no principles of any sort.

498
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,600
And this is going to make you anxious.

499
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:57,760
If you hear this story right that he's telling you about the fact that there's nothing more basic than the norms that you happen to have.

500
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:16,239
And the only thing that makes some people more the s the pr more authentic than others is their suffering and learning and risking until they have more sensitivity to the norms than even than everybody else, and they can extend them.

501
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:27,800
Anyway, if you believe that, you could find that very upsetting, because that is in effect to say our final intelligibility is ungrounded.

502
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,120
There is different, there's no better culture or worse culture.

503
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:38,119
It isn't as if it would be nice to think, for instance, that the way we do things is the right way to do things.

504
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:39,799
I tried to think of examples of that.

505
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:49,880
Well, for instance, sitting in a chair, isn't that more comfortable, healthier, and so forth than sitting on the ground or squatting at low tables and so forth?

506
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,079
No, that's just what we do, is sit in a chair.

507
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:55,400
There's nothing superior about that.

508
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:05,960
But if you want to think that somehow our culture has figured out, by much long evolution of the culture and so forth, the best way or the right way of doing things.

509
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,440
But if there isn't any best way or right way of doing things, then you get this feeling that things are ungrounded and we're facing an abyss.

510
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:26,999
And if you do, as I was telling some of the students in my office hours when I once taught this, just once this happened, at this very point in the lecture, it would be interesting to see, one of the students got so upset he ran out of the room and threw up.

511
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:31,799
That's really sensing the abyss of groundlessness.

512
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:37,400
And Heidegger would have thought, boy, that was a really authentic person.

513
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,879
They understood how anxious this could make somebody.

514
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,360
But what Heidegger thinks is, you don't need that kind of grounding.

515
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,159
It's a mistake to think that if you haven't got a ground, this is a pun in German.

516
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:57,080
There's grund, which is ground.

517
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:59,800
There's Abgrund, which is abyss.

518
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:05,840
And Heidegger wants to say you don't have to think that if there's no ground, then you're facing an abyss.

519
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:09,519
I think in a way Sartre thinks nausea, for instance.

520
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:11,519
It's all just contingent.

521
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:17,680
I don't remember whether Roconkin throws up after he figures this out or not, but he might well.

522
00:55:17,999 --> 00:55:24,079
But Heidegger thinks that there is a word he makes up, an unground, an ungrundt.

523
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:38,480
And the unground is just what we've been talking about: the shared norms that everybody can recognize and can even recognize, some of the people can recognize when other people or them have a better sense of the shared norms.

524
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:47,119
And you don't need, I mean, the way I say it to myself is you don't, and I've never had much of a sense of Afgrund, I must say.

525
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:52,239
I'd be perfectly happy with the unground of the norms.

526
00:55:52,240 --> 00:56:08,079
But when you've got this unground that we've got, if Heidegger's right, that doesn't keep you from becoming a student, from becoming authentic, from getting married and having kids if you want that, from climbing the Himalayas if you want that.

527
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:18,960
You can lead a meaningful, satisfying life without having solved the philosophical and religious question about why is it all that way and not some other way.

528
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,920
That, I think, is the Heidegger and Wittgensteinian intuition, and it's very anti-philosophical.

529
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,400
That's why he's so important and interesting.

530
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,359
He's the tradition.

531
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:29,999
Go ahead.

532
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,119
But no, Jurg, your comments are exactly the right ones.

533
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,240
Go ahead.

534
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:50,360
I mean, we can just bring up some people like Pervin Development and Poles.

535
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,400
That's it.

536
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:56,599
Good, good.

537
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:00,280
That's a devastating objection, and that is the right next move.

538
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,239
And I'm glad you made it because people would be feeling it.

539
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:09,879
The famous person who makes that move and who made it on me once is Jürgen Habermas.

540
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:16,519
Jürgen Habermas said, okay, all that Dreyfus is, I gave a seminar with him in Frankfurt.

541
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:24,999
He said, yeah, all that Dreyfus is saying is so, but it's about what counts as good relative to a culture.

542
00:57:24,999 --> 00:57:39,480
And you could have a very good, just exactly what you're saying, a very good Nazi who had a much subtler understanding of what it is that Nazi culture believes in and was able to do just the appropriate thing.

543
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:53,160
And Habermas said, but what we want to know is what's right, which culture, which of these various versions of the good is based on the kind of principles that show that it's right.

544
00:57:53,159 --> 00:58:15,720
And the answer to Habermas, either you believe Habermas and you go out and you look at Kant, for instance, to find out what's right, or you look at whatever philosopher, oh, you look at Habermas, which has something he calls discourse ethics, which he claims is valid for any culture that has a language, which is every culture, and defines what, if you work it out, you'll see what's right.

545
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:25,960
Or you say, which is what Heidegger would certainly say, and now we can think of Heidegger as having read lots of Nietzsche, which he had, Heidegger would just say, there isn't any answer to the question, what's right.

546
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:40,080
Wouldn't it be nice if we could know whether there were principles of reason or revelation or psychology or whatever, which told us which the Nazis were the wrong way of doing things and we've got the right way of doing things?

547
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,280
And we have a kind of intuition that that must be so and that there ought to be some way to settle it.

548
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:55,120
But nobody's ever come around with any way, you know, and this you have to admit, and it's not, it makes you unhappy, and me too, maybe.

549
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:01,840
I mean, nobody's come around with the one agreed-upon way to settle the fact that the Nazis are wrong.

550
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:03,199
Is it rational?

551
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,119
Is it language and discourse?

552
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,119
Is it the Bible?

553
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,280
You want to say something?

554
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,199
That's the awesome and somewhere in the infection.

555
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,719
Heidegger does?

556
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,039
Habermas, not Heidegger.

557
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,160
Where?

558
00:59:35,999 --> 00:59:37,840
Leaping in or leaping ahead.

559
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,960
Ah, good, good.

560
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,799
But that's very, very empty and formal.

561
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,599
Why Fine Buddha?

562
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:59,279
And that is still otherwise faithful.

563
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,920
Well, I just think that in the world there are good energies that are not very.

564
01:00:05,999 --> 01:00:09,999
Then there are these interviews that are not very good.

565
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:11,759
Okay, wait, stop.

566
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,799
I agree with you.

567
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,399
I mean, that this is an important line.

568
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:24,280
But with time running out of my but what he's doing is you were consciously you're purposely doing Levinas or you're doing Levinas accidentally.

569
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,719
I see, but no, I think, well, you're even more doing Levinas.

570
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:33,960
I mean, both Levinas and Habermas were total followers of Heidegger.

571
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,440
And then they broke away over just this issue that we're having.

572
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:50,119
And Levinas talks about how other human beings require this total, make an absolute demand on you that you respect them as human beings.

573
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:54,039
It's sort of Kantian end in itself in Habermasish thinking.

574
01:00:54,039 --> 01:01:12,920
In Levinas, who's a religious Jew, it's sort of God being the kind of other, and everybody has a kind of, God has a human face, so to speak, and human faces all remind you that there is this one vow behind them.

575
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,119
It goes back to Buber, too.

576
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:15,879
There are all stuff going on in here.

577
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,119
But we've gone as far as we can go.

578
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:26,840
But at least it's good to know that Heidegger's, he wouldn't come along and say, ah, yeah, I see Habermas is right, or oh yes, Levinas is right.

579
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,999
He thinks that he's right.

580
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:36,039
That sort of all you can get is this very formal fact that you should not take over other persons.

581
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:38,279
You see, he's got a sort of a minimal ethics.

582
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,599
Everybody ought to take a stand on their own being.

583
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:50,440
And if you do something to somebody else that keeps them from taking a stand on their own being by brainwashing them into what you want them to believe, that must be wrong.

584
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,280
That's leaping in for them.

585
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,799
You've got to leap in ahead of them.

586
01:01:53,800 --> 01:02:02,559
I take that to mean you've got to force them to turn around, face themselves, and take a stand on, and realize that they've got to take a stand on their being.

587
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,199
That's how much ethics there is.

588
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:08,639
It doesn't tell you anything about what to do.

589
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,519
Yeah.

590
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,480
It's actually important to realize how.

591
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,120
Yes.

592
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:21,920
Good, good.

593
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,119
That's a good point, too.

594
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:28,160
Yes, if you think that you know what's right, that's a very dangerous position.

595
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:28,959
All right.

596
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,999
And yeah, well, that's well, that's a nice answer to Habermas, isn't it?

597
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:40,639
I mean, at least, I mean, it sounds like Habermas might himself be part of the problem because he thinks he knows what's right.

598
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,199
Never mind.

599
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:44,559
This is a great subject for discussion, but we've got to go on.

600
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,320
We've got stuff to cover.

601
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,919
Where are we?

602
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,360
I think I'll.

603
01:02:51,999 --> 01:03:05,519
Okay, we just saw that all the stuff that really happens in the middle of 165, where Heidegger turns against average and publicness and says, in effect, by publicness, everything gets obscured.

604
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:07,200
And what have we been talking about?

605
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:17,120
Well, what is the status of the primordial that gets glossed over, of this higher, outstanding way of acting that gets leveled?

606
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:24,560
And there's lots to be said about it and what it is and how you would recognize it and how you would acquire it and how you would justify it.

607
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,120
But there's nothing more, I think, that I can say anyway about it.

608
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,640
And I want to get on to the last issue we have to talk about.

609
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:39,600
So there's publicness, Kierkegaard, and all the evils of conformism.

610
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:52,599
And he talks on page 222, he just mentions in passing, way back in Division II, he uses the phrase, making the one your hero.

611
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,519
I mean, what is that?

612
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:56,680
Well, that's what it is to be a conformist.

613
01:03:56,679 --> 01:04:03,560
That is to do what you do because it's what people do, what one does.

614
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:19,560
And that is, you make the norms the one, the ultimate source of justification, but not the one in the sense that the norms in general, but the current public, banal, standard one.

615
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:28,120
If you think that that's what tells you what to do, then you can just accept that and you are disburdened and tranquilized.

616
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:30,920
And that is conformism.

617
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:38,840
My favorite example of this kind of mindless conformism that people have is sending Christmas cards.

618
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:45,400
I mean, they are all, everybody's going around sending Christmas cards to everybody, filling all those trees and so forth.

619
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,119
And some of it makes sense.

620
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:56,279
I mean, if maybe you use it to communicate with somebody you don't see often and only once a year, you write them a message and send them pictures of the kids.

621
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,880
I can sort of understand that.

622
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,160
But the neighbors across the street send me Christmas cards that I see every day.

623
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:07,960
And even though for years I haven't sent anybody a Christmas card, they keep doing it.

624
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,560
And that is mindless conformity.

625
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:18,840
That is really just doing what one does without the slightest indication of why to do it, except, well, one does it.

626
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,199
One sends Christmas cards.

627
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:22,039
That settles it.

628
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:22,519
Okay.

629
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,280
Now, then we've got to go on to the positive.

630
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,519
So, and by the way, all that I think is existential.

631
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:40,480
Conformism is something that one can do, and so is being standing out and being authentic.

632
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,920
That's existential.

633
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,440
That's sort of the end of the chapter, which we're heading toward now.

634
01:05:46,079 --> 01:06:05,039
And I just want to say there's, but there is also, and we've been saying it in the background, a positive role for the one, which is existential, and that is this crucial line on 167, where the middle of the page, I read it last time.

635
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:09,760
The one articulates the referential context of significance.

636
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,960
And that means, he asked me to give an example and say what I mean.

637
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:30,559
That means that it's one tells you that you should cut up your food in hand sizes and not make it too hot, or you should make it so you can grab it with a chopstick, or you can grab it with a fork, and it tells you when to eat and what to eat and where to eat and who with and all that.

638
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,880
It's articulating the whole referential totality of food, for instance.

639
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:46,959
And if it weren't for that, you'd all starve to death because we wouldn't be knowing whether to cook things or not and when to eat them or not and how to cut them up or not and what is it we should eat and not and so forth.

640
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:55,039
So you and all over, of course, the one is the norms are just telling you what one does.

641
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:02,799
And you better do what one does, or you'll, if you drive on the left-hand side of the road in the United States, you won't last very long.

642
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:15,119
Now, I want to say the last thing: the existential status of the one.

643
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,159
And that's what he comes up with at the very end of the chapter and says some very interesting things about it.

644
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,199
166.

645
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,839
So the norms are the ground of all intelligibility.

646
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:35,240
That makes the norms the answer of, well, if you're going to answer who you are, let's get that.

647
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,799
I don't know where that is, but let's get that out of the way.

648
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:40,919
Normally, you are one.

649
01:07:40,919 --> 01:07:42,679
You do what one does.

650
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:55,320
So the answer, remember, is if we want to find out the who of Dasein, we formally indicate the who of Dasein as the I or the ego, but then we keep looking around and we do this chapter.

651
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:14,839
By the time we finish this chapter, we discover that you do what one does, and you are what you do, and therefore you are the one, unless you pull yourself out of it by authenticity, which was division two.

652
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:25,959
But now we also want to know, remember, not only who you are, to which the one is the answer, but what's the source of intelligibility of the world?

653
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:47,959
Well, we just discovered the one is the answer to that, too, because the one articulates the whole intelligible context of significance, which is all the things that we do and how they're all related to each other and how they're all related to ultimate for the sake of which is, which are also had in the monormative component, namely, roles.

654
01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:50,279
And that makes it.

655
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,599
So now we want to see where it is.

656
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:53,799
Just a second.

657
01:08:53,799 --> 01:09:12,639
On page 166, he says, in the second paragraph, 128 of the German, second sentence, well, and he says, the more openly the one behaves, the harder it is to grasp, the higher it is.

658
01:09:12,639 --> 01:09:14,639
We read that one, but it's not nothing.

659
01:09:14,639 --> 01:09:23,519
If we see it ontico-ontologically with an unprejudiced eye, it reveals itself as the realist subject, in quotes, of everydayness.

660
01:09:23,519 --> 01:09:29,919
That's his way of saying we see it as having replaced the role of subject as the source of intelligibility.

661
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:35,360
And he even goes so far, he sort of gets carried away with funny ideas.

662
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:43,599
It turns out the one is God, or the one is doing the job of God, which is namely, you know, giving all the world its order.

663
01:09:43,599 --> 01:09:50,159
The way he says it is at the end of the previous paragraph on 166, the first full paragraph.

664
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:55,360
In this kind of being, Dasein is an ens realissimum.

665
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,280
That's medieval for God.

666
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,919
That's the highest being, the supreme being, the most real being.

667
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:09,360
So Dasein is an ens realissimum, if by reality we understand a being that has the character of Dasein.

668
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,440
Now, never mind anything except just the way he's playing around with this phrase.

669
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:26,639
It's not just trivial to say that the one has taken the role of God, because the one has taken the role of giving the whole, all the intelligibility we've got.

670
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:30,480
And there was a sociologist named Durkheim.

671
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,879
I don't even remember his first name, any sociologist.

672
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,159
Emil, Emil Durkheim, who actually says society is God.

673
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,799
Well, that's Durkheim discovering the same point.

674
01:10:40,799 --> 01:10:58,679
I mean, that it's society, it's the customs, that's Pascal's name for it, it's the cultural norms, that's my name for it, it's Das Mann, that is the one, that's Heidegger's name for it, which gives us the whole structure of reality.

675
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,839
And how are we going to describe this ontologically now?

676
01:11:04,839 --> 01:11:06,200
What is the status of the one?

677
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,480
Is it ready to hand?

678
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,079
No, it can't be like that.

679
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,360
Is it present at hand?

680
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,759
Well, certainly it's not going to be like that.

681
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,440
It's more like familiarity.

682
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,320
It seems to be a kind of component of familiarity.

683
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:26,999
All the stuff, one of the aspects of all that we're familiar with is what one does with it and what one doesn't do with it and so forth.

684
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:32,919
But even that doesn't help much because he never tells us what the ontological status of familiarity is either.

685
01:11:32,919 --> 01:11:36,919
It's neither ready to hand nor present at hand nor Dasein.

686
01:11:36,919 --> 01:11:42,759
So in the end, he sort of has to throw his hands up and say, we don't have any vocabulary for talking about it.

687
01:11:42,759 --> 01:11:51,320
This is what's happening on 166 still, about a little below the middle now, in the middle of the second paragraph.

688
01:11:51,320 --> 01:12:05,879
One may neither decree prematurely that the one is really nothing, nor profess the opinion that one can interpret this phenomenon ontologically by somehow explaining it as what results from taking being present at hand together of several subjects and fitting them together.

689
01:12:05,879 --> 01:12:07,959
That's trying, Husserl tries to do that.

690
01:12:07,959 --> 01:12:16,199
He tries to build, and Sterl too, I guess, tries to build up shared intentionality out of the individual intentionality.

691
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,199
Heidegger doesn't want that.

692
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:23,799
He says, and so he's saying, just a second, I want to make sure I read this in later.

693
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,759
And it's also, you can't do a Hegel sort of move, which is the next paragraph.

694
01:12:28,759 --> 01:12:34,240
The one is not something like a universal subject, which a plurality of subjects have hovering above them.

695
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:44,159
That would be a funny way of describing Hegel's notion of spirit, which is sort of working through everybody to make and improve the culture.

696
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,079
Heidegger won't buy that.

697
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:54,480
And at the bottom, he says, and of course we can't understand it.

698
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:59,519
And so traditional logic fails us when confronted with these phenomena.

699
01:12:59,519 --> 01:13:03,199
That's not surprising since logic's very crude anyway, he says.

700
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,320
It's only this residue of present at hand.

701
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,839
So what's the moral of that going to be?

702
01:13:09,839 --> 01:13:11,839
Is he just going to give up?

703
01:13:11,839 --> 01:13:20,719
Well, no, the moral of it's going to be to do just what he's been doing, namely, stick to the phenomena, the end of the second paragraph.

704
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:26,480
Just, I mean, wouldn't it be nice if we could make it fit into some of our ontological categories, but we can't.

705
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:32,480
So he says, in working out our concepts of being, one must direct one's course by these phenomena.

706
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,959
One can't push them aside.

707
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,719
Then, and that's what he has to say.

708
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:47,679
I mean, in effect, he's been describing the phenomenon, and we've been describing it, for the whole time.

709
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:55,519
And he can't, it just doesn't fit in his ontology, but he's going to make it absolutely central nonetheless.

710
01:13:55,519 --> 01:14:00,959
It is the who, it is of us, it is the source of all intelligibility.

711
01:14:00,959 --> 01:14:05,679
And if you can't put it in your ontology, don't worry so much about that.

712
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,679
Just stick to the phenomenology.

713
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,280
That's the punchline on 240.

714
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,679
Oh, and then I forgot what I told you we would get to.

715
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,119
We will, in just a second.

716
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,400
248.

717
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:20,519
I just want to read the one sentence on 248 of the history of the concept of time.

718
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:27,240
Before words, before expressions, always the phenomena first, and only then the concepts.

719
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,519
Exclamation mark.

720
01:14:28,519 --> 01:14:30,199
So stick to the phenomena.

721
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,759
But now I just have time to read what I, I don't know, I just did my notes.

722
01:14:34,759 --> 01:14:35,799
How shocking.

723
01:14:35,799 --> 01:14:38,360
So read 167.

724
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:48,679
For one thing, the italics, the they as an existentiale is a primordial phenomenon belonging to Dasein's positive constitution.

725
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:54,999
So that's, remember I said there's the existential negative story about the public and leveling.

726
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:03,719
We've just heard the existential positive story about the function of norms for intelligibility.

727
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:12,200
And now I just want to so we're ready to read the bottom of 168.

728
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,879
We've got just two minutes to do it.

729
01:15:13,879 --> 01:15:23,400
But you'll understand what might have seemed very cryptic and incomprehensible, the italics in the last paragraph of the chapter.

730
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,959
Authentic being oneself.

731
01:15:25,959 --> 01:15:28,919
Cross out the one, because that just confuses us.

732
01:15:28,919 --> 01:15:42,839
It's really, in German, it would be authentic self-being, or being a self, you could say, does not rest upon an exceptional condition of the subject, a condition that's been detached from the they.

733
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:50,440
It is rather an existential modification of the they, the they as an essential existentiale.

734
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:55,480
Now, I've prepared you for that, otherwise I couldn't tell you in two minutes what's going on.

735
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:06,400
Well, the they as an existenciel, sorry, the they as an essential existentiale is public norms that we've gone over and over now.

736
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:18,239
It's the takes the place of God and takes the place of everything and explains who we are and normally and explains how everything is all the time, gets its intelligibility.

737
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:24,879
And therefore, if you were going to be authentic, you there are two forms.

738
01:16:24,879 --> 01:16:27,519
He doesn't say it here, but I'll say it my way.

739
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,440
Yeah, okay, no, he does.

740
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:38,719
The they, the one is an existential modification of the they.

741
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:49,839
That is, one way to relate to the one is to make it your hero and to live in terms of it and be a conformist.

742
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:54,159
That would be, so let me try it again.

743
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,120
So, authentic.

744
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,079
So, there are two ways.

745
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,839
Let me say it my way and then I'll read it.

746
01:16:57,839 --> 01:16:59,919
There's the existential.

747
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:01,919
That's the norms.

748
01:17:01,919 --> 01:17:03,839
That's the way the one works.

749
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:14,639
There are two existencials, two ways an individual can relate to that structure, that existential structure.

750
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:24,239
One can either make it yourself, define yourself as the one, and do what one does, and be a conformist.

751
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,799
That's an existential modification of the one.

752
01:17:28,799 --> 01:17:31,440
Or you can be authentic, and we talked about that.

753
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,999
That's a different existential modification.

754
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:45,360
You can either live in leveling and let it tell you what to do at all points, or you can become a cultural master and respond to the unique situation whenever it's important to do so.

755
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,679
Now let's read it again.

756
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:53,959
Authentic being oneself does not rest upon an exceptional condition of the subject, a condition that's been detached from the one.

757
01:17:53,959 --> 01:17:56,759
So being authentic, you don't get out of the one.

758
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,240
It, namely being authentic, is an existential modification of the one.

759
01:18:01,559 --> 01:18:02,759
Oh, I was misreading it.

760
01:18:02,759 --> 01:18:05,719
And then I started reading it right now, and I got it wrong.

761
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:06,679
So it's okay.

762
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:14,279
So there it says authentic self-being, that's fine, is an existential modification.

763
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:32,599
It doesn't say, but I didn't claim it did, that so is being inauthentic, namely living by way of the norms, an essential, an existential modification of what is constant and basic, namely the norms.

764
01:18:32,759 --> 01:18:34,839
I think that's pretty clear.

765
01:18:34,839 --> 01:18:39,400
Okay, that's one quick, quick remark then, but we're over time.

766
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,599
Being authentic, does that mean all that terms?

767
01:18:42,599 --> 01:18:54,119
I always do Latinx, Latin Labor, because if everyone went authentic, everything, you know, is not ah, I see.

768
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,160
You know, well it'd be interesting.

769
01:18:55,160 --> 01:19:03,799
No, well, the trouble, if everybody went authentic, they could still do the normal, average, banal thing, for instance, when they brought their groceries.

770
01:19:03,799 --> 01:19:12,599
So it only it only doesn't the authentic person doesn't at every moment respond to the concrete situation and never respond to the general situation.

771
01:19:12,599 --> 01:19:13,719
And that makes it all right.

772
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:21,959
If everybody went around all the time responding uniquely to the unique situation, we'd be as bad off as if everybody went around just doing crazy things.

773
01:19:21,959 --> 01:19:23,159
Yeah, okay.
