1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,001
Try again.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,200
Okay, I could either just give up on Gareda, on idle talk, and go on to falling, but having spent this much time on it, I figure we ought to at least try to get some kind of closure.

3
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:21,760
So I've written out what I think is the right way to think about it and try to prevent some of the wrong ways to think about it.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,080
And here we go.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:33,841
For one thing, I caused a problem, but it was a good problem because you have to make mistakes to learn from the mistakes.

6
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:38,321
It was a mistake to bring in gossip and to bring in bullshit.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:48,080
Both of them have their own kinds of motivations for misusing language, and that's what all of them have, a misuse of language.

8
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:58,161
But you can just give up any, just stop gossiping and stop bullshitting.

9
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:02,881
But whatever it is that idle talk is, it's much more complicated.

10
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:13,920
It's something which, in a certain way, you just got to have, the way you've got to have the leveling that goes with intelligibility when you have the one.

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:31,120
But yet there's a wrong kind of talk where it goes beyond the kind of leveling that's necessary, and then it becomes idle talk.

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,600
And we've got to figure out what that is.

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,281
So let me start.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:50,560
I've been convinced that idle talk is not a bad translation because it doesn't seem to tie in with what some kind of motivation like showing off or prying into other people's business or anything.

15
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,920
Another possible translation is chatter.

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,880
And Kierkegaard, at least his translation, calls it talkativeness.

17
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:12,440
And now we have to understand what it whatever it is, there is some kind of way of using language which has a positive function.

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,600
And it's typical of the use of language in everydayness.

19
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:20,921
And we want to understand what it three levels.

20
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:30,120
That's my whole hope in to make this sensible is to say that there are three ways of using language that you can distinguish.

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:40,280
Primordial talk, which is using language in its most appropriate way to reveal things.

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:49,160
And whatever language is, I was going to say this later, but as I'm talking, I see it might be better just to say what is using language in its most appropriate way.

23
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:55,481
So we can keep that as a guide for when we, there are two stages of losing it.

24
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:57,720
But what is it, the it that we're losing?

25
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:02,361
Well, that's very important on page 56, which I keep mentioning.

26
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:08,921
He says more in one paragraph about what he means by talk back there or discourse.

27
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,881
When I say talk, that's because that's what the German word is, Reda.

28
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,720
Discourse is all right.

29
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:36,120
And I guess I should, it would be more less confusing if I talked the language of the translation that you're reading, but really I can't do it because I just hear the talk, very common sense notion of talk is somehow what Heidegger's getting at, not some fancy thing which we call discourse.

30
00:03:36,120 --> 00:04:03,840
So, anyway, so but he's explaining talk or discourse, whichever, and by telling you that they're related to what the Greeks called logos, then about halfway down the first full paragraph in discourse, and so far as it is genuine, what is said is drawn from what is talked about.

31
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:14,241
So, the discursive communication in what it says makes manifest what it is talking about and thus makes this accessible to the other party.

32
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:21,041
That's the structure of logos as apophansis, that is, logos as showing something.

33
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,041
He goes on to say the showing something.

34
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:33,601
This mode of making manifest, in the sense of letting something be seen by pointing it out, does not go with all kinds of, does not go with all kinds of discourse.

35
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:36,241
Oh, yeah, then you couldn't have requesting and other stuff.

36
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:44,161
But there is a special basic positive, positive is a word that's going to have to be used for something else.

37
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:50,000
Primordial use of discourse, and the beginning of the next paragraph says it again.

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,600
When fully concrete, talking, letting something be seen, has the character of speaking, vocal proclamation in words.

39
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:05,120
All that is the crucial thing is it's letting something be seen by pointing it out.

40
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,640
That's the primordial, basic, right function of talking.

41
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:33,640
And then there's also a kind of, and this is the tricky one, a kind of idle talk which is necessary to carry on the business of average everydayness, which is what he's talking about.

42
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:45,880
And there's a positive kind of disclosedness that's typical of everydayness, and that also comes under idle talk on 2.11.

43
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:49,481
I try to keep you so you don't get lost.

44
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,921
The important thing is that there are three things to distinguish.

45
00:05:52,921 --> 00:06:00,041
If you only have two, you get confused because you try to make one of the two do too many jobs.

46
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:17,801
There is the primordial kind, there is what I'm going to talk about now, the positive kind, which has a useful function, such a useful function that you couldn't get rid of it and still have average everyday coordinated practical activity.

47
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:25,801
And then there's the use of talk, which is covering up and not showing things as they are.

48
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,281
And I'm now on the second kind, which is the positive kind of talk.

49
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,361
And he talks about that on 2.11, right at the beginning.

50
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:41,960
The expression idle talk is not to be used here in a disparaging signification.

51
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:51,321
Terminologically, it signifies a positive phenomenon which constitutes a kind of being of everyday Dasein's understanding and interpreting.

52
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,041
Now, it's positive.

53
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,201
We don't know why yet, but that isn't to say it's primordial.

54
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:10,361
That is, it's not going to be just the best kind of pointing out things as they really are to somebody who shares the situation with you so that you both can see it and understand it.

55
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,120
That's the primordial kind.

56
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:21,281
That's the, I keep going back to that phrase, which for some odd reason I can't remember, but I always remember when I see it.

57
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:29,120
So let me just, so remember, keep remembering that the basic situation is letting something be seen by pointing it out.

58
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,320
So there's got to be somebody you're pointing it out to, and you've got to be right in the face of it, and you've got to have the skills to recognize it.

59
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:56,320
It isn't enough to, if one chess grandmaster says to some ordinary chess player, well, to take my example of the tank, the guy who's the Hun type general who said, you know, put the tank here and pointed at a place in his sort of fortress.

60
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,120
It didn't work because he wasn't pointing it out to me and my brother because we didn't have the skills to see it.

61
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,320
So you've got to have the skill, you've got to have the thing to see.

62
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:09,120
But now that's the primordial one.

63
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,281
The positive one is what he wants to talk about under this notion of idle talk.

64
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,680
And so we have to keep our eye on that.

65
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
And that's what we're going to do.

66
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:30,481
So we want to distinguish between the three kinds, primordial familiarity, which he calls genuine discourse back on 56 when I was reading.

67
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:33,520
And he talks about it again on 208.

68
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,841
So let's look at that.

69
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,921
The middle of 208, the very middle, right below 165, or a little below 165.

70
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,480
Keeping silent authentically is possible only in genuine discoursing.

71
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:52,161
That's the same as primordial discoursing, as I'm using the term.

72
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,961
That's when you're pointing out to somebody something which you both have the skill to understand.

73
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,680
To be able to keep silent, Dasein must have something to say.

74
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,481
That is, it must have its disposal an authentic, rich disclosedness of itself.

75
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:11,161
And that's like the two people who understand whatever they're talking about.

76
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,281
In that case, one's reticence makes something manifest and does away with idle talk.

77
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:27,960
As a mode of discoursing, reticence articulates the intelligibility of Dasein in so primordial a manner that it gives rise to, oh boy, I'm reading the wrong passage there for you.

78
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,960
I mean, I'm still, that's all about the genuine.

79
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:31,880
I said I was going to talk about the positive.

80
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,601
I will.

81
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:36,760
But, well, how did I get that quote doing this job?

82
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:39,400
Oh, it's supposed to be about the genuine.

83
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,961
I just misled you, but my notes don't mislead me.

84
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:54,681
All this is he wants, you can talk in such an intelligible way, in so primordial a manner, that you get, that the hearing is genuine and the being with one another is transparent.

85
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,400
That's all the number one good kind.

86
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,041
Now, I owe you a talk about number two, the positive kind.

87
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,081
And then we saw that the first place where he says it's a positive phenomenon is on 2.11.

88
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,361
I read that already.

89
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:09,560
But let's look again.

90
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,161
I want to fill it out a little more.

91
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,201
So on 2.12, there's a chunk about it.

92
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,681
And this is now we've gone from primordial, genuine, to average intelligibility.

93
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:31,320
But average intelligibility is still intelligibility, and we better have average intelligibility, or life isn't going to be on.

94
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,760
You're not going to be able to go on.

95
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:43,241
Pause, you should ask yourself: Could you always be in a situation in which the exact thing you're talking about is in front of you and the person you're talking to, and you both have the skills to recognize it?

96
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:45,361
That's asking an awful lot.

97
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,041
Nobody can do that.

98
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:58,561
There's much more in the everyday world than what you stand in front of, so to speak, face to face, and much, much more than you have the skill to recognize and deal with.

99
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:01,841
So you get this average intelligibility on 212.

100
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:07,201
In language, there is spoken when one expresses oneself, there lies an average intelligibility.

101
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:21,681
In accordance with this intelligibility, the discourse which is communicated can be understood to a considerable extent, even if the hearer does not bring himself into such a kind of being towards what the discourse is about as to have a primordial understanding of it.

102
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,281
That's pretty clear.

103
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,320
We do not so much understand the entities that are talked about.

104
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,881
We already are listening only to what is said in the talk.

105
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,681
What is said in the talk gets understood.

106
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:39,761
But what the talk is about is understood only approximately and superficially.

107
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,761
Well, that's really my carburetor example was an example of that.

108
00:11:45,760 --> 00:12:01,841
It may not be, it has some maybe misleading aspects, but there is something, I mean, it's only misleading if you assume that the person who hears the mechanic say the carburetor was dirty has no clue as to what a carburetor is.

109
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:03,281
But that's not how it is.

110
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,961
They don't know much about a carburetor.

111
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:14,321
They wouldn't recognize one if they saw it, but they know it's something in the car, and they know that it's something that if it works, the motor runs, and if it gets dirty, the motor doesn't run.

112
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:22,881
And you could tell them some more, that it's kind of like an atomizer, which they do know what that is, maybe, that sprays the air and the gas and so forth.

113
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:37,561
And you could, without them having the skill of a mechanic to really understand and fix carburetors, you can, there is this positive level which he's talking about here, which is approximate and superficial.

114
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:53,481
My relation to carburetors is certainly that, but it's something that you can at least gives you some way to coordinate your activity, to tell the next time it happens, you can say to the mechanic, oh, I bet the carburetor is dirty.

115
00:12:53,481 --> 00:13:00,041
You can say to your wife, the carburetor was dirty, even though she understands as little as you what that really means.

116
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,001
She also understands it means something inside the motor isn't working right, and so forth.

117
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:12,441
And so you still have the same thing in view and the same averageness, and you have a common understanding of what's said.

118
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:15,321
All that is the positive version.

119
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,401
I think so.

120
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:24,841
Okay, and so that's positive, average, everyday intelligibility.

121
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:32,281
And then you sort of gradually go into some third thing.

122
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,881
And that's when he talks about how the function of language is perverted.

123
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,401
That's the word he uses in the middle of 213.

124
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:49,241
He's talking about, well, let's just read that paragraph, because that's where he's introducing the third kind.

125
00:13:50,841 --> 00:14:01,161
Discourse, which belongs, talk, still, I want to say, which belongs to the essential state of Dasein's being and has a share in constituting Dasein's disclosedness, has the possibility of becoming idle talk.

126
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,361
Yeah, and it's, remember, you have to keep saying, and that's still all right.

127
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:05,641
That's positive.

128
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,641
So let's see what, when does it go wrong?

129
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,440
When it does, it serves not so much to keep being in the world open for us in an articulated understanding as to close it off.

130
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:16,160
Ooh, I never realized how misleading this is.

131
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:20,400
I know that whenever I read this chapter over and over, I get dizzy.

132
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:34,721
Well, now, having started with idle talk as positive, as average understanding, as certainly necessary for there to be a social everyday world at all, he switches it right there.

133
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:41,841
If you can do something bad with language, it has the possibility of becoming idle talk.

134
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,601
He doesn't have enough words.

135
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:53,441
What we want is a word for primordial talk, then another word for average talk, and another word for idle talk, because look where he's going now.

136
00:14:53,441 --> 00:15:05,681
And when it does, it serves not so much to keep being in the world open for us, which even the carburetor talk did, in an articulated understanding, it closes it off and covers up the entities within the world.

137
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:10,481
Well, telling me the carburetor is dirty didn't cover up anything and didn't close off anything.

138
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:14,801
It just didn't help, didn't give me any deep understanding.

139
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,281
To do this, one need not aim to deceive.

140
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,081
Well, that's sure.

141
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:20,160
This has nothing to do with lying.

142
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,200
You can add that on your list of not gossiping and not bullshit.

143
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:24,640
It doesn't, it's not lying.

144
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,161
Idle talk does not have the kind of being which belongs to consciously passing off something as something else.

145
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,761
Using language as a con person is put that on the list.

146
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,961
That's the best way to put it.

147
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:41,520
So gossiping isn't and bullshit isn't and conning people isn't.

148
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:52,481
The fact that something has been said groundlessly, and then gets passed along further and further retelling, amounts to perverting the act of disclosing into an act of closing off.

149
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:54,320
Well, now I'm beginning to understand.

150
00:15:54,321 --> 00:16:01,401
I knew if I actually talked about it to you all, I'd finally understand where it gets so confusing.

151
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:03,801
It just got confusing, unless I'm mistaken.

152
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,881
He went too fast over the positive, smash into the negative there.

153
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,200
And that's when you don't, it looks like there's not these three distinctions.

154
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:24,361
And when you don't have the threefold distinction, you can't make any sense of what in the world, most of the time, talking is doing in an average everyday way.

155
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,681
It's doing this middle thing.

156
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:37,321
It's giving you enough understanding so that you can coordinate your activity and cope with what's going on, but you don't have the deep understanding that the people with the skills have.

157
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:49,161
But now we are on, he's trying to talk about here, and the degraded kind, the perverted kind of language, which has an absolutely negative function.

158
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:54,041
That is, it's keeping you from understanding anything.

159
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,760
So that's all over the place in here.

160
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:02,120
For instance, on 212.

161
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,241
And again, the fast move, the middle of the page.

162
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:12,040
What's being said all is now stands purity that stands in for the genuineness of the discourse.

163
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
This is really still a positive kind.

164
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,561
And the understanding which belongs to it and for its appropriateness to the facts.

165
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,800
That is, you'll have to make do with what little understanding you have of carburetors.

166
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:40,921
Now he goes on, because this discoursing has lost its primary relationship of being towards the entity talked about, which is true, but I don't have any primary relation to carburetors, in such a way as to let this entity be appropriated in a primary, I've lost this primordial understanding.

167
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:44,721
But communication rather follows the route of gossiping.

168
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:46,160
I want to know about the German.

169
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,520
I hope that isn't gossiping.

170
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,241
We decided it wasn't, didn't we?

171
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,880
It could be gossip, but it better not be here.

172
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:07,121
Because if gossiping is talking about stuff which is none of your business, that's not relevant.

173
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:08,961
That was my fault last time.

174
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:10,560
So I just cross out gossiping.

175
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,560
There is a word there, but it's a word that really means passing the word along.

176
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,800
And so whatever, do we have a word for that?

177
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,520
I don't know.

178
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,961
A single word?

179
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:31,760
For repeating what you just heard to somebody else so that it becomes more and more distant from the situation in which you heard it?

180
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:34,080
What?

181
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:36,241
Hearsay.

182
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,681
Yeah, that's good, I think.

183
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,600
Hearsay isn't gossip.

184
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:40,801
No, that's right.

185
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,121
Good.

186
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:41,760
Hearsay.

187
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,161
Yeah.

188
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,481
Put right in hearsay for gossiping.

189
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
It's even built into the English.

190
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:57,280
You just hear it, and then you go and say it, and that's all you, and that's the thought is, and that's the kind of relationship you have to it.

191
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,161
And that's a bad thing, passing the word along.

192
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:06,000
And he's again made this fast move from genuineness or skipping the positive.

193
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,760
He's smacking the negative, because now he says what's said in the talk spreads in wider circles, and things are so because one says so.

194
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,201
That's hearsay, all right.

195
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:25,520
Idle talk is constituted by just such hearsay, passing the word along, the process by which in its initial lack of grounds to stand on becomes aggravated to complete groundlessness.

196
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,961
Well, there you go.

197
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,241
He does it again.

198
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,120
And I don't know how many times I should read things to you.

199
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:37,481
One more at the bottom, the page 212.

200
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:45,161
The average understanding of the reader, I don't know if that's really in there, you don't need it, will never be able to decide what's been drawn from Pompon.

201
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, I want to say that to later.

202
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,640
That's an interesting, that's got to do with ambiguity.

203
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:56,040
And 213, let's look at 213.

204
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,401
And perverting, I read that already.

205
00:19:59,401 --> 00:19:59,961
Good.

206
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:05,000
So now, I'll give you, just to, anybody want to say anything about that?

207
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,641
That's sort of the basic insight.

208
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:16,040
That's what I hope is right and that we've learned after, I don't know how many, at least three or four hours of talking about this.

209
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:29,961
If everybody buys it, I was going to give you another example sort of based on Blattner, because I was looking at the secondary sources, and Blattner's got a pretty good grip on this, and a kind of nice example of it.

210
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:33,721
I didn't take quite his example, but it's similar.

211
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:34,600
So I'll just run through it.

212
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,241
It's just another example instead of carburetors.

213
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:41,961
So I have a primordial understanding of teaching in a university.

214
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,000
What does that mean?

215
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,361
And this is where Blattner is helpful.

216
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,040
That means I can talk with people about it who understand what I'm talking about.

217
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,360
They can make useful suggestions to me.

218
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,000
They can point out things that I've done wrong.

219
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,680
They can point out to each other things they dislike and like about it.

220
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:57,481
All of that.

221
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,481
That is not any old people, but other teachers in the university.

222
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
That's the first level.

223
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:12,560
And that's the proper function of talk as logos, as pointing things out in a shared way.

224
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:17,601
And it's a way of articulating some, what I would call sub-world, I mean, the world of teaching.

225
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,441
It's not the big world, the referential totality, but it's got its own little world.

226
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:35,120
And now, then, well, then what I wouldn't say, and I have a derivative, privative, but nonetheless positive, understanding of kindergarten teaching.

227
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:41,680
That is, I can understand it well enough to decide which kindergarten to send my kid to after going and observing some.

228
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:46,880
I can sort of see what's working and what's not working sometime.

229
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:55,040
I can talk to other parents about what they think about how their kid is doing in kindergarten and where the best one is and so forth.

230
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,600
That's the derivative, but positive.

231
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,800
And it's not covering anything up as far as I can see and pushing it into groundlessness.

232
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,560
That's just what you have to do if you don't know about teaching kindergarten.

233
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,961
And that's none of you do, I imagine, or only a few, and I haven't a clue.

234
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:25,040
And then I tried to think of, and what would it be like to be talking about it and passing the word around about it and have no relation to it, not having ever taught kindergarten or even sent your kid to kindergarten.

235
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, there is a, it just occurred to me then, there is a situation like that right now.

236
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,840
I doubt if many of you are in it, but I got sort of dragged into it.

237
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:42,481
There are the people who are very worried, and maybe they're right, about the children don't play enough anymore.

238
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:52,801
And they say, I just got a petition in the mail about three days ago, as usual, every few weeks, asking me to sign this thing saying there should be more playtime and more playgrounds.

239
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,201
And what are the poor kids doing instead?

240
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:57,121
They're learning to use computers.

241
00:22:57,121 --> 00:23:02,360
Their computer is now that are just wonderful for, I don't know, six-year-olds to learn to use.

242
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:17,721
And now, what's interesting about that is I'm sure there are some people who are actual kindergarten teachers whose views about this and how much time they should play and how much time they should use computers in kindergarten, I would trust.

243
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:23,560
And then there are other people who at least have somewhat understanding of it, like me.

244
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,000
I think my impulse would be: it's a little early for computers.

245
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:34,600
I think it's nice if they play and sing and dance for a while in kindergarten, but I don't really have any basis on which to say it.

246
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:48,201
And then there are these people sending out these petitions and being interviewed on television and having mass rallies against computers in kindergarten, who I have a feeling are just having a kind of fixed reaction.

247
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,161
They get it all from, what's the guy's name?

248
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:52,360
Anybody know?

249
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,681
You probably don't recognize what I'm talking about.

250
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:56,760
Forgetting it now.

251
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,921
Waldorf School people.

252
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:00,840
Any of you, Waldorf School people?

253
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,961
Waldorf, what's the guy's name behind it?

254
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,000
Steiner.

255
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Yeah, this is all a kind of Steiner talk, and it could be interesting, but it could just float off into everybody who's a Steiner person has a view about that you shouldn't be touching computers at all until I think they're 13 or something like that.

256
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:31,160
And that seems to me you'd be floating off pretty far into just covering up what they should be really studying and worrying about and asking teachers about it.

257
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,241
Anyway, that's my concrete example.

258
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:43,241
People have opinions, and then and with no positive experience, well, no, certainly no primordial, not even any positive experience, they still got opinions.

259
00:24:43,600 --> 00:25:03,520
And that made me think, well, maybe the extreme form of this is the talk show, in which you with a perversion of talk is that everybody gets their chance to talk and everybody calls up and has an opinion, which then an opinion which has no no not necessarily any positive relation.

260
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,321
And I wonder, so so I would call them idle talk shows.

261
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,000
That's my new, I mean, that's how that's what they really are.

262
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,320
Heidegger's nailed them, I think.

263
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,401
Did somebody have a hand coming up?

264
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:18,080
Yes, that's Tyler.

265
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:29,280
Have somebody view from these things as past numbers experientialization would be one of the ends of the strange patterns.

266
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:30,881
I think that's right.

267
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:33,760
Is that what you think, or you think I'm not reading that right?

268
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:38,560
I think one possibility is trying to understand it.

269
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:40,321
Well, good.

270
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:40,881
Keep trying.

271
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,961
Go ahead.

272
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,440
One of your simple biggest mindsets.

273
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:53,840
Right.

274
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:57,201
Yeah.

275
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,920
That's right.

276
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:13,201
Yeah.

277
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,760
We wouldn't have a primordial relation to it.

278
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,520
We don't have it uh uh I I don't know if we're we're disagreeing.

279
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,880
In you're are you just ta are you trying to take in view to um literally maybe?

280
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:46,520
I mean it seems to me even in having kindergarten in view, uh you could be standing in the middle of the kindergarten and talk about it, but if you were standing over coffee in another room and you weren't actually looking at the kindergarten, but you were a kindergarten teacher and so was I, we'd still have it in view.

281
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,201
I think that that's okay.

282
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:02,201
Right.

283
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,080
Okay.

284
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:04,921
Yeah.

285
00:27:13,161 --> 00:27:15,241
But we're visually present.

286
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,360
Yeah.

287
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:38,520
Or the way you're intact on it really is not as important as it appears.

288
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:49,961
Yeah, yeah, I think a lot depends on the way you're reading it, this uniqueness claim.

289
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:52,921
I don't I don't see the uniqueness claim in here.

290
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,401
I mean but of course we we don't know what this in view means.

291
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:56,760
That's the point I want to hear.

292
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,840
I don't think back to the kindergarten.

293
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:07,401
I don't c I can't believe that we can't have a genuine relation to the kindergarten even when we're having you know coffee or outside of it.

294
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:21,441
Although maybe if it was if it would help, if it was really the uniqueness of this particular kindergarten class at this point in the semester, maybe you would need to be actually there in front of it.

295
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:35,920
But I don't think that's I just have the feeling that's putting too strong a requirement on genuine primordial discourse that you have to be visually present and talk about that unique thing.

296
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:40,161
And I'm missing in your story and in Heidegger's story.

297
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:41,520
I'll call in your second.

298
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:46,481
The thing about the skill, it certainly wouldn't, I don't think we're disagreeing about that.

299
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:48,080
Heidegger just doesn't put it in.

300
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,641
It isn't enough to stand in front of the symposium, the podium, and do it.

301
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:58,800
I mean, let's take, but it was better to take something more like a chess master talking to another chess master.

302
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:04,721
They've got to have the position in front of them, presumably, and they've got to be chess masters.

303
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:08,800
And now, how much, you know, the chess is a funny example.

304
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,520
It certainly doesn't have to be visually present in front of them.

305
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,080
They can each there be chess masters.

306
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,160
They can have it in their mind.

307
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:17,760
I guess that's all right.

308
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,800
I don't think it becomes any less primordial.

309
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,041
But anyway, I can't go any further.

310
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:31,120
If you have quotes that push us in the direction of this actual presence and actual uniqueness, I'm ready to see them.

311
00:29:50,961 --> 00:29:51,441
Yeah.

312
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,160
Okay.

313
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,201
Well, okay.

314
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:14,921
He, the phronesis, the practical wisdom, is something that he definitely interested in.

315
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:29,000
He gave whole courses on Aristotle's notion of practical wisdom, and it shows up in Division II in the Guilt chapter, where he never mind it, it's in the Guilt chapter, nothing means what it seems to mean in Division II.

316
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:41,481
But in the chapter, he distinguishes responding to the general situation, which is what most people do, and responding to the unique, concrete situation, which is what the person of practical wisdom does.

317
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,961
And that could be what's going on here.

318
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,441
I mean, it sort of cuts both ways.

319
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:48,520
He does know it, and that's on your side.

320
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,441
I mean, maybe that's what he has in his mind.

321
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:54,280
But if he knows it, he certainly doesn't, in the two places, refer back and forth.

322
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:00,680
He doesn't say that the phronesis is using language in its genuine form.

323
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:03,880
He just says he's responding appropriately.

324
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:08,120
And here he doesn't say Aristotle is the one who understood it.

325
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:11,640
So I'm going to do it my way.

326
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:13,800
But it's important you can all keep your eyes open.

327
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,280
Let me make clear again what Tyler is saying.

328
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:25,241
I mean, how direct and unique does your situation have to be?

329
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:36,441
How direct is your relation to the object, and how unique does the object have to be when you're talking about it to somebody else in order to count as genuine primordial discourse?

330
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,841
I think that's fine.

331
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,481
Now I saw these hands that were inspired by this discussion.

332
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:42,040
Yeah.

333
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:58,801
If you go to the new stage between primordial or groundless, that we're adding in this concept of positive versus negative, they're that fairly why do you think it isn't part of it?

334
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:05,760
He used the term positive, and he certainly has lots of negative things to say about the perversion is pretty negative.

335
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:20,800
The idea is closing off because all the techniques are putting the negative closing off on words, you must all move that off.

336
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:25,441
Yeah, okay.

337
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,040
But he's got, but wait, you're doing a good job of calling attention to a distinction.

338
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:44,561
There is another kind of closing off, but he's certainly on 213 talking about a closing off which can be pushed on to complete groundlessness.

339
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,121
Where is that?

340
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:46,961
Is that the next paragraph or someplace?

341
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:56,880
His closing off is not just sort of stopping the conversation, but passing the word along more and more outside of the context.

342
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,721
Where did anybody see that?

343
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:00,241
What I'm looking for?

344
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:09,201
There's passing the word along two-thirds down on 212, but there's some place where it, oh, here's right after that.

345
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:28,280
Passing the idle talk is constituted, this is two-thirds down on 212, by just such passing the word along, a process by which its initial lack of grounds to stand on, that's the positive, I think, which is no direct experience, becomes aggravated to complete groundlessness.

346
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,360
That sounds like a bad thing.

347
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:31,080
And let me go further.

348
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:39,640
And indeed, this idle talk is not confirming vocal gossip, but even spreads to what we write and takes the form of scribbling and so forth.

349
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,760
And okay.

350
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,320
Anyway, I think that he's got it negative.

351
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,000
Okay?

352
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,361
Next point.

353
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,081
Anybody else?

354
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,561
I saw another hand that you may have already said what you want.

355
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,201
Yeah.

356
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:19,480
Well, that's what Tyler raised, and I don't, but I don't think we're concerned about it, you say.

357
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,961
Do you think we have to take sides on this question, or can we leave it?

358
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,760
I can give my first.

359
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:40,840
Okay.

360
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,080
Well, yes, I guess, but if I understood you.

361
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,080
I'll leave that to you all.

362
00:34:49,081 --> 00:35:00,041
I mean, what you need to ask yourself is: how much of a direct in the presence of X do you have to be when you're talking about it to somebody else?

363
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,760
How much skill do you have to share?

364
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,921
Do you have to have it actually in view?

365
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:13,161
Is it enough that you have both been in this, had the, as Tyler put it, had had the first-hand experience, but you're not having it right to the end?

366
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,280
You can worry about that.

367
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,560
I don't think anything important for us hangs on it.

368
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,840
If it does, you have to tell me about it because it doesn't fit.

369
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,800
I mean, I have no place for it right now in my picture.

370
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,920
So I'm going to go on.

371
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,000
And if you then tell me later that I've sort of messed up the picture, come and tell me in office hours.

372
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:35,120
People do, plenty.

373
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:36,321
And I learned a lot.

374
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,241
Okay, now let's see.

375
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:46,561
So I just got to the ideal talk show, which is the idle talk show.

376
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:53,200
And what Heidegger then calls scribbling, which we're right on the place where he's calling it, about 10 lines from the bottom.

377
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:56,161
Indeed, this idle talk is not confined to vocal gossip.

378
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:57,280
That's the talk show.

379
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,640
But even spreads to what we write where it takes the form of scribbling.

380
00:36:00,641 --> 00:36:02,881
What's the latest form of scribbling?

381
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,241
It's blogs.

382
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:11,841
It's people writing about what they don't know anything about, and other people are reading about what they don't know anything about and have definite opinions about.

383
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,881
And it's got this kind of ambiguity in it, too, that he talks about.

384
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,760
I mean, it's not, I'll just say a word about that.

385
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,241
Even on talk shows, there are people who really know what they're talking about and are worth listening to.

386
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:29,121
And there are a lot of people who are just windbags.

387
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:30,640
And the same thing with blogs.

388
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:39,120
Not all blogs are absolutely useless and just people liking to hear themselves talk or see themselves scribble.

389
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,280
But the problem is, you can't tell.

390
00:36:44,280 --> 00:37:02,441
Once you get outside the context and outside the expertise, Heidegger thinks, you, the reader of the blog or the listener to the Idol Talk show, can't distinguish the ones who are worth listening to because they really have a primordial relation to what they're talking about and the ones who aren't.

391
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:05,080
And that's the ambiguity that he talks about.

392
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,320
I think I'm ready for ambiguity in the just got there.

393
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:11,800
Yes, you can't tell.

394
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:20,760
And you know, blogs are set up so that you're supposed to be able to tell because the ones that get most hit on are supposedly the most reliable.

395
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:27,161
But they might just be the ones that appeal to the most people's prejudices or superstitions or stupidity.

396
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:34,841
There's no guarantee that just because they're blogs that a lot of people read, that the people who are writing them have anything to say.

397
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:40,440
So anyway, this is, and Kierkegaard already was talking about this scribbling phenomenon.

398
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:46,440
He called it the press or the media who were the phenomena behind it.

399
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:58,040
I'm sort of returning Heidegger to Kierkegaard, who really brought up the whole thing in terms of the evils of the press and the media where people, I'll just say this real quick.

400
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:12,520
At the time of Kierkegaard, 1850, they were just discovering sort of coffeehouses and people having conversations in a way about things that were kind of universal things.

401
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:18,120
People like Voltaire, who had views about all sorts of things, could talk to other people who had views about all sorts of things.

402
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:21,000
Kierkegaard thinks, Habermas thinks that's great.

403
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:23,321
That's the beginning of the public sphere.

404
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,880
And he thinks the public sphere is wonderful because these people who have no direct relation to what they're talking about it.

405
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:39,881
I'm putting funny words in his mouth, but it comes out that, and have no experience of what they're talking about, and certainly no commitment as not taking sides, because, as he puts it, they're outside of power.

406
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:42,481
They're just kibbutzers, I would say.

407
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:47,360
And those people now get together in the coffeehouses and make a big deal.

408
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:52,480
And Pablomas thinks that they're making great critical progress and people should pay attention to them.

409
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:07,841
And Kierkegaard thinks it's just the beginning of the end, the end being the talk shows and blogs where people have gotten taken out of the concrete shared situation in which genuine discourse is possible.

410
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,920
That's what the media does for people in the Heidegger-Kierkegaard version.

411
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,880
So no, let's go.

412
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
I mean, that was just an aside.

413
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,200
So let's go.

414
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:23,360
But if you want to read more about it, read Kierkegaard, The Present Age, where he's got this great attack on the media.

415
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:27,280
He thinks the press is going to destroy the West.

416
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,880
And so now on 17, where are we?

417
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,920
217.

418
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,201
I have things I want to read about ambiguity.

419
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:38,400
So let's just do it, because we're now ready for ambiguity.

420
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,480
And I skipped, as you can see, curiosity.

421
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,360
This is a funny grab bag of idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity.

422
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,520
They just, I mean, it seems sort of arbitrary that he's got these three things.

423
00:39:51,601 --> 00:40:04,640
It looks like if you worked at that a little, you could think of some fourth thing that you could throw in as part of what covers up what it is to be a Dasein.

424
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:09,280
But at least I can see, and I just tried to do it, how ambiguity comes in.

425
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,161
If you're outside of the situation and outside of the skill, then how do you know what to believe and what not?

426
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,040
It's curiosity that I skipped because I think it's just a totally different issue.

427
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,241
I'll get back to it.

428
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:41,161
The ambiguity on 217, he says, when in our everyday being with one another we encounter the sort of thing that is accessible to everyone, about which anyone can say anything, that's the, you know, I keep saying talk show, blog picture, it soon becomes impossible to decide what is disclosed in a genuine understanding and what is not.

429
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:49,081
This ambiguity extends not only to the world, but to being with one another and Dasein, even Dasein's being toward itself.

430
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,920
I've got to say something about that.

431
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,681
I thought that was fascinating.

432
00:40:52,681 --> 00:41:07,721
What would it be to have an ambiguous relation to yourself and even to have a sense in which, and I'm not sure Heidegger's saying this, in which the ambiguity is some positive virtue.

433
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,640
Let's go on a little.

434
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:20,840
Everything looks as if it were genuinely understood, taken hold of, genuinely spoken, though at bottom it's not, or else it does not look so, and yet at bottom it is, and so forth.

435
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,521
Well, maybe I got a little off the beam here, but I was thinking about Second Life at this point.

436
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:32,280
There's this sense in which everybody, I mean, how many know about Second Life by this time?

437
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,721
A lot of people, I imagine.

438
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:49,321
This virtual world in which it's like a masquerade, in which people go there not to be directly confronting themselves and each other, but to be sort of what they would like to be instead of what they really are.

439
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:58,360
And that way, and make a positive, and that, a masquerade in general, of which Second Life is the latest version, it was already a big hit in the Renaissance.

440
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:09,641
Romeo and Juliet were met at a masquerade, but now they would meet on Second Life, and they would be disguised, he would be disguised as a woman, and she would be disguised as a man, but it would all work out anyway.

441
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:22,560
And what's interesting is this idea that not confronting what's going on and who you're talking to and what shared things you're pointing out can actually look like an advantage.

442
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:29,280
Somehow your true self comes out when you can disguise yourself as a member of the opposite sex or whatever.

443
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:35,201
There's some ambiguity is just running rife in Second Life.

444
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:42,561
Nobody's asking sort of what is really going on, who are they really talking to, or what is the situation really like.

445
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,441
That's all been just turned into the virtual.

446
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,081
I think Kierkegaard and Heidegger would find that really upsetting.

447
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,921
Yeah, you want to say something about it?

448
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:12,480
Heidegger's even saying that, for example, you have no idea, particularly politics, but he would say, Pauline hasn't been able to talk to us.

449
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,201
That's right.

450
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,280
Yeah, that's exactly.

451
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:35,760
That's right.

452
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,241
That's right.

453
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,760
That's exactly what he's saying.

454
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,040
He's saying, and you can have to take your stand on this.

455
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:51,121
With Habermas and Charles Taylor, for instance, who believe in the public sphere, the fact that you have no experience of what you're talking about has nothing to mean, no harm.

456
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,960
You're a rational being, and you can criticize what the administration is doing, even though you...

457
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:14,280
I mean, to put this in an extremely outrageous form, which I do when I talk about this in lectures sometime, is it's as if you'd rather listen to Chomsky if you're on the far left than Kissinger, who's on the far right.

458
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,241
But Chomsky's never done anything but linguistics.

459
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:21,000
And yet, if you like his politics, you'll listen to him.

460
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:22,681
I'd rather listen to Kissinger.

461
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:27,160
Even if I totally disagree with his values, he actually did something.

462
00:44:27,161 --> 00:44:29,080
He got Israel and Egypt together.

463
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:31,961
He was involved in ending the Vietnam War.

464
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:39,561
When he talks about politics, you don't have to agree with him, but at least you have the feeling that you better pay attention to him.

465
00:44:39,561 --> 00:44:41,560
Whereas I'm not so sure about Chomsky.

466
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:44,841
I mean, he's read a lot of newspapers and correlated them.

467
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,360
But I don't, I mean, so anyway, that's the issue.

468
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,560
You have to have a feel for this.

469
00:44:49,561 --> 00:45:10,280
And this is a kind of Kierkegaard-Heideger issue that goes against sort of the whole idea of democracy and a critical electorate and so forth, and goes in the direction of you want experts to be making the decisions who are in these various domains.

470
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,400
And that's sort of unnerving and makes people annoyed, but that may still be the truth.

471
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,400
Anyway, that's certainly Heidegger's lie.

472
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,041
Yeah.

473
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:28,280
Sort of like someone noticing that are they sort of haven't understandable what's going on?

474
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,480
They don't think you know why.

475
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,040
That's good.

476
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:32,600
It might.

477
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:38,440
It might add uh that but then uh you don't know, I mean wha and what do you do about that?

478
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:46,560
You certainly don't read the the carburetor literature of the person who knows that it's something in a car that has something to do with the gas.

479
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:55,280
I mean they should why should we look at their blogs and listen to them on talk shows if all they got is this secondhand kind of understanding.

480
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,241
And then, just to repeat, we're back to ambiguity.

481
00:45:58,241 --> 00:46:01,280
If only you could tell who had the real understanding and who didn't.

482
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,241
And there are clues.

483
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:08,401
I mean, I mean, I would say it's pretty clear that Kissinger understands something about politics at first hand.

484
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,920
And I yeah, anyway, I don't want to say more about it.

485
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,121
But I just want to go back and read something here.

486
00:46:18,561 --> 00:46:19,920
No, I don't even need that.

487
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:22,800
Because I want to make sure we get where we're supposed to be.

488
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,641
Yeah, I want to get to curiosity.

489
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:25,520
Because I want to make sure.

490
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:26,721
I want to do falling today.

491
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:28,561
I want to go on to care next time.

492
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:31,681
But I do think it this I do think things are getting clearer.

493
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:32,081
I don't know.

494
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:32,960
I hope you all do.

495
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,241
I mean, people look a lot more focused than they were last time, because I was unfocused.

496
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:40,081
So, okay, curiosity.

497
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,681
We don't know really what's going on with curiosity.

498
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:52,321
But if you want to integrate it with the other two, here's a try.

499
00:46:52,320 --> 00:47:00,881
You could ask yourself the question: well, why do people engage in idle talk and in scribbling?

500
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,441
And if it's so ambiguous, and if you really can't learn anything about yourself or the world from it.

501
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,241
And the answer would be, first answer would be, well, it satisfies their curiosity.

502
00:47:12,241 --> 00:47:13,520
Why shouldn't they be curious?

503
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:15,121
That's a good thing to be.

504
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:21,360
And that's an aspect of everydayness and averageness.

505
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:32,520
It doesn't seem necessarily a perversion to want to understand as best you can, even though you're not directly involved, what people are saying about what's going on.

506
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:38,361
It's not a very high level of understanding, but it isn't covering up yet.

507
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,161
And if that's what curiosity is, then why not have curiosity?

508
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:46,120
But then he does a turns against curiosity.

509
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:48,201
This happens on 216.

510
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:50,840
Curiosity is no fancy term.

511
00:47:50,840 --> 00:48:01,721
It just means being interested in all sorts of things, which, strictly speaking, are none of your business in the sense that they're not in your world and you don't have any expertise in them.

512
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:10,920
What I think, my model of curiosity at this point is listening to the news and watching the TV news, even when it doesn't concern you.

513
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,201
You're watching some big storm hitting the coast in Indonesia or something.

514
00:48:16,201 --> 00:48:21,321
Well, that must be curiosity because there's nothing you can do about it or learn from it.

515
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,800
But people do that.

516
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,681
And now, why should we be against it?

517
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:28,921
Well, here's the bottom of 216.

518
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:39,160
When curiosity has become free, it concerns itself with seeing not in order to understand what is seen or come into being towards it, but just in order to see it.

519
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:43,321
I presume that's why you watch, mostly why one watches the TV news.

520
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,480
It seeks novelty to leap from it anew to another novelty.

521
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,521
So you get the sound bites or the picture bites.

522
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:52,760
It seeks novelty only in order to leap from it.

523
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,560
Oh, no, you do.

524
00:48:53,721 --> 00:48:59,800
In this kind of seeing, that which is an issue for care does not lie in grasping something and being knowingly in the truth.

525
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,161
It lies in the possibility of abandoning oneself to the world.

526
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:09,080
Therefore, curiosity is characterized by a specific way of not tearing alongside what is closest.

527
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:11,640
Or back to whatever closest means.

528
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,520
It's certainly in some way direct relation to what's going on.

529
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,361
That's not what's going on when you're listening to the news.

530
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,560
Consequently, it does not seek the leisure of tearing observantly, but rather seeks restlessness.

531
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:33,841
That's one, you know, one scene to the next on television, from Indonesia to Warsaw to New York.

532
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:42,321
Consequently, it does not seek the leisure of tearing observantly, but rather seeks restlessness and excitement of continual novelty and changing encounters.

533
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:49,440
In not tearing, curiosity is concerned with the constant possibility of distraction.

534
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:51,041
That's the next move.

535
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:53,441
So, why would anybody do this?

536
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:04,561
Watch the TV news, jumping from little bits of this subject to little bits of that subject, none of which concern you and about which you're learning absolutely nothing except how it looks.

537
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:05,520
Why would you?

538
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:09,600
Well, Heidegger wants to say, this is a view that goes back to Pascal.

539
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:12,081
He introduced the notion of distraction.

540
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:16,001
That really it's because you don't want to think about something.

541
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:32,961
That distraction is if you want to see and hear everything in this way, it's because what you don't want to do is face up to where is that coming from?

542
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:39,681
It sounds icy.

543
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,280
Well, they've been lucky.

544
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,640
It's only happened once.

545
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:45,521
But anyway, we'll have to just go on.

546
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:54,321
So the so the the the Heidegger's view is that it's the it's curiosity is the one of those, it's in the third level of covering up.

547
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:09,161
It's not facing up to what you should be watching and being concerned with, like how the how the Berkeley City Council is performing, which has an effect on your life and about which and dealing with things that you know something about and have sort of opinions about.

548
00:51:09,161 --> 00:51:11,561
Okay, so let's see now.

549
00:51:11,561 --> 00:51:13,800
And that's that's all I want to say about that.

550
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,481
Like, think, let me see.

551
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,241
217.

552
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,201
Okay, let's see.

553
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:19,720
Oh, there's a little more here.

554
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,481
So let's read it.

555
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,241
It's interesting that this distraction is just the opposite of wonder, he says at the bottom of 216.

556
00:51:27,241 --> 00:51:38,760
That is, curiosity has nothing to do with, I suppose, that Steinoff scene or whatever the word for wonder is, where that is.

557
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,840
Oh, you don't have it in front of you, probably.

558
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,041
Okay, never mind.

559
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:44,280
I'm going to say it is wonder, I'm pretty sure.

560
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:51,800
So that's to be amazed at the point of not understanding something, to be amazed to the point of not understanding something in which it has no interest.

561
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,641
That's the problem.

562
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:57,321
It concerns itself just to have known.

563
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,120
It's distraction and so forth.

564
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,201
Never dwells anywhere.

565
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:06,360
So the final thing at 217, curiosity is everywhere and nowhere.

566
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:12,841
This mode of being in the world reveals a new kind of being of everyday Dase Hein, a kind which Dasein is constantly uprooting itself.

567
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:30,441
If it was, if blogs and what was the, and talk shows were the problem, here I think it is just the problem of being a news junkie, where you have to, every hour you listen to make sure there isn't something somewhere in the world that you don't know about yet.

568
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,921
And you need to know, you want to know about everything.

569
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:44,081
I mean, that's because you don't want to know about the fact that, and now with a sort of punchline for this, is there's something uneasy about being Dasein.

570
00:52:43,241 --> 00:52:47,920
There's this, we're going to talk about it when we get to falling in a minute.

571
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:56,241
And this, what he calls uncanniness, I would call it unsettledness of Dasein, is what you don't want to know about.

572
00:52:56,241 --> 00:53:09,280
And that motivates you to think that you want to know about, or pretend, or believe, or something that you want to know about, all sorts of things that don't keep from your having to think about whatever this unsettledness is.

573
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:12,320
I haven't told you what it is, so that's why you look puzzled.

574
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,640
But that's all right, because we're ready to go to falling.

575
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:26,881
And falling is where the issue of the issue is, in the falling chapter, just to jump a bit ahead, is a new concept, namely fleeing.

576
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:36,561
And what he's been talking about in idle talk and in ambiguity, not so much in ambiguity, in idle talk and in curiosity are modes of fleeing.

577
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:41,121
They're not just lack of groundedness.

578
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:50,241
There's some way that Dasein is trying to not get a clear account of what the world is and what its situation is.

579
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:52,320
So let's jump to this.

580
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:54,641
We're now on 219.

581
00:53:55,521 --> 00:54:00,401
I'm afraid, by the way, I might as well tell you now, the falling chapter is a complete mess.

582
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:08,881
The whole business of falling is a mess because Heidegger's got too many different meanings of falling all going on at once.

583
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,041
I say that every once in a while, but now it's time to sort of face up to it.

584
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:21,440
Luckily, for what's really, I think, interesting and important in Heidegger, it doesn't matter how you finally thought out falling.

585
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,520
But for understanding the book, it matters.

586
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:25,601
So we have to think about it.

587
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:37,241
He says at the bottom of 219, sort of the bottom of 175 in German, that there is a basic kind of being which belongs to every Danus.

588
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,041
We call it falling of Dasein.

589
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:47,800
And now he wants to say immediately a whole bunch of stuff, all of which is sort of too many things at once.

590
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,081
So you have to read it carefully at the top of 220.

591
00:54:51,081 --> 00:55:07,641
This term, that is falling, does not express any negative evaluation, but is used significantly, used to signify that Dasein is proximately and for the most part amidst, remember, this is the right way to pronounce it, amidst the world of its concern.

592
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:13,000
This absorption has mostly the character of being lost in the publicness of the they.

593
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,241
So there's two kinds of absorption going on there.

594
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:26,280
The kind of absorption you're in when you're just going out the door or in flow and coping, which we talked about a lot when we talked about understanding.

595
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:33,241
And now we've got another kind of absorption, which is this business of being lost in the they.

596
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:37,560
And fallenness does the job of both.

597
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,201
I'll read you passages in a minute that show that.

598
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:46,440
Dasein has, in the first instance, fallen away from itself and has fallen into the world.

599
00:55:46,760 --> 00:56:01,561
Well, when you're in flow, you're fallen into the world, and when you're sort of taken over by the they, when you're falling in with the they, or that is becoming a conformist, you're also taken over.

600
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,720
Fallenness into the world means an absorption in being with one another.

601
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:08,121
That's only one kind of absorption.

602
00:56:08,121 --> 00:56:09,561
That's the they kind.

603
00:56:09,561 --> 00:56:15,681
Insofar as it's guided, and notice we're back to idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity.

604
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:17,040
So, how does it work?

605
00:56:17,201 --> 00:56:29,200
Well, idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity are that third cover-up bottom, bad bottom-level of average everydayness.

606
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:50,160
And now he's going to call that way of Dasein's being that is absorbed in average everydayness as by being curious and by having a lot of opinions and talk.

607
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,601
He's going to call all that falling.

608
00:56:53,601 --> 00:57:07,201
And the trouble is, he's also got another view of falling, that is that you are falling into falling to work and getting absorbed in what you're doing.

609
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:11,601
And they're just two different kinds of absorption.

610
00:57:11,601 --> 00:57:16,000
And if you could only just stick to one or the other, that would be fine.

611
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:18,641
But he doesn't.

612
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:21,440
So, just because, well, I won't try to jump ahead.

613
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,441
Let me go straight by sec.

614
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,521
And now that's one of the problems: that there are two kinds of absorption.

615
00:57:29,521 --> 00:57:37,201
The other kind of problem is that there's an existential kind of falling and an existential story about falling.

616
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:46,561
That is, there's a certain way in which falling is a necessary, existential, ontological structure of Dasein's being.

617
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:50,481
And we're going to hear a lot about that in the following chapter.

618
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:57,121
But there's another sense in which falling is not necessary and not universal.

619
00:57:57,121 --> 00:57:58,600
It's just general.

620
00:57:58,081 --> 00:58:05,161
I mean, a lot of people are falling in the second sense, the existential sense, but they don't have to.

621
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,640
That's really the distinction between being authentic and being inauthentic.

622
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:20,920
Being inauthentic, we'll hear a lot more about it in Division II, is falling away from yourself by letting yourself be taken over by the one.

623
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,760
It's being a conformist.

624
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,400
And you don't have to be, nobody has to be a conformist.

625
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:34,601
The world will go on just fine without any conformists, just like without any gossip and without any bullshit and without any con people.

626
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:38,760
That's an existential problem.

627
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:56,760
So you've got to constantly pay attention to whether he's telling you about this existential structure which is falling, or whether he's telling you about this existential possibility, which is also called falling.

628
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,480
So now you've got a sort of fourfold mess.

629
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:08,520
You've got two kinds of falling, absorbed in the world and absorbed in the one, the coping kind and the conformist kind.

630
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:29,800
And then you've got two kinds, two ways of falling, or well, two philosophical views of falling, the one that sees it as a universal, necessary structure of human being, and one of them that sees it as a general feature of how unfortunately most human beings behave.

631
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,440
Okay, now I'll give you some pages, unless anybody has any.

632
00:59:32,521 --> 00:59:34,280
I don't think you have anything to say about that yet.

633
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,041
I wouldn't imagine.

634
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:38,120
You've probably tried to read the falling chapter.

635
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,480
If you were very confused, I wouldn't be surprised.

636
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,081
I mean, every time I reread it, I'm confused.

637
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:48,000
So there's a structural kind of falling.

638
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:54,241
And you get hearing about that on page 220, where we are.

639
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:01,361
Skipping down to the bottom paragraph, the middle of the last full paragraph.

640
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:07,201
Dasein, now I'm quoting, has fallen into the world, which is again ambiguous.

641
01:00:07,201 --> 01:00:10,481
That means either coping or conforming.

642
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,961
If Dasein has fallen into the world, which itself belongs to its being.

643
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,201
Dasein is being in the world.

644
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:22,000
Falling is a definite existential characteristic of Dasein itself.

645
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:24,001
Keep your eye on the ball for that.

646
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:29,521
I mean, that means with one kind of falling, Dasein, all Dasein has it all the time.

647
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:36,721
And I think 224, I'll get to follow my notes, is another one of those existential claims.

648
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:52,161
Yes, the middle of 224, the first full paragraph, second sentence, 179 in the German, falling reveals an essential ontological structure of Dasein itself.

649
01:00:52,480 --> 01:01:07,040
Now, that's got, can't be the same notion of falling as on 220, where he says about falling, that it is, so there are three lines from the top.

650
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,161
I read it already.

651
01:01:08,161 --> 01:01:13,361
Dasein has mostly the character of being lost in the publicness of the day.

652
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,721
That is, mostly Daseins are conformists.

653
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:26,001
But that's not, of course, falling as a structural, existential, ontological, universal structure.

654
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:30,600
That's just a lot of people generally are conformists.

655
01:01:28,081 --> 01:01:32,120
But that counts as falling too.

656
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:36,041
Right there in the opening definition of it, he's got it as mostly.

657
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:42,040
And then on the same page where he's got it as mostly at the top, he's got it as an existential at the bottom.

658
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:44,681
This is very hard to deal with.

659
01:01:50,521 --> 01:02:05,161
So there's an existentiale, and that's all got to do with how you get with intelligibility, how you've got to have a certain, you've got to follow norms and conform.

660
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:15,081
But then there's this other claim that you don't have to be a conformist and do everything you do for the sake of the norms.

661
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:28,121
And that is, if you do everything you do for the sake of the norm, if you, quote, make the one your hero, then that's an existential, not an existential structure.

662
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,400
That's an existential possibility, as he'll put it.

663
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:37,560
That is a way of using the one to cover up something that's unsettling about Dasein.

664
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:41,560
Now look at 220 and see where we are.

665
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:45,080
Okay.

666
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:45,800
Yeah.

667
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,841
Oh, boy.

668
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:58,520
I don't know if I read it, it'll just seem to confuse you, but it's here written down.

669
01:02:58,521 --> 01:02:59,561
What can we do?

670
01:03:00,201 --> 01:03:13,000
So he says at the end of the top full paragraph, not being itself functions as a positive possibility of that entity, which in its essential concern is absorbed in the world.

671
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:23,201
If it's a positive possibility, that means that it's not an existential structure, that you don't have to do it.

672
01:03:23,201 --> 01:03:26,081
So why is it a positive possibility?

673
01:03:26,081 --> 01:03:27,760
Well, I don't know, but let me just read it.

674
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,721
Maybe it'll come.

675
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,760
I'll understand it by the end of the next sentence.

676
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,041
I don't think so, though.

677
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:41,361
The not-being itself functions as a positive possibility of that entity which in its essential concern is absorbed in the world.

678
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:49,921
This kind of not-being has to be conceived as a kind of being which is closest to Dasein and which Dasein maintains itself for the most part.

679
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,721
That's the clue that it's existential.

680
01:03:52,721 --> 01:03:57,841
So there's an existential possibility.

681
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,841
Why is it positive?

682
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,800
I don't really understand that.

683
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:14,481
If you skip down to the next big, sort of the last full paragraph, he says, in falling, Dasein itself, as factual being in the world, is something from which it's already fallen away.

684
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,560
And he's going from the positive, well, never.

685
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:21,280
He just gets to the existentiale if you keep reading.

686
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,041
So here's the problem.

687
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,400
Anybody who wants to help, now is the moment to jump in and help.

688
01:04:26,721 --> 01:04:32,720
There is something that most Daseins do, which is a bad thing to do.

689
01:04:32,721 --> 01:04:39,040
It's falling away from, and you can imagine, covering up and fleeing what it is to be Dasein.

690
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:43,201
But he wants to make sure that you understand that it's a positive possibility.

691
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:45,040
Why not a negative possibility?

692
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:45,520
Oh, good.

693
01:04:46,641 --> 01:04:48,000
Yeah, Tyler, let him talk first.

694
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,921
Okay, go ahead.

695
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,600
Uh-huh.

696
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:58,241
Okay, that's helpful.

697
01:04:58,681 --> 01:05:03,881
Eugene says we shouldn't think of positive as, what did we come across this morning?

698
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,041
At the beginning of my lecture, it was positive, which was not.

699
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,640
Yes, idle talk's positive.

700
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:10,040
Right.

701
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:12,920
No, so I should, I'm just losing my own list here.

702
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:18,681
So idle talk can be positive in the aha.

703
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,600
You see, though, why are you getting so confused?

704
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:25,800
When idle talk is positive, it's in the middle of the three, positive, so stuff.

705
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:32,920
And it's positive because it's doing the job of making understanding public and average and everything.

706
01:05:40,121 --> 01:05:42,121
Okay, it's something necessary.

707
01:05:42,121 --> 01:05:45,400
I mean, you need, and it's really positive in the sense of good.

708
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,361
But here, positive is not in the sense of good.

709
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,121
It's just not privative.

710
01:05:50,121 --> 01:05:53,080
Is that what you're okay?

711
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:54,520
But that's confusing already.

712
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:56,840
Then there are two senses of positive going on.

713
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,480
Is that right?

714
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:13,080
There's a kind of positive which you'd absolutely need for the culture to go on, and a kind of positive which would be nice if everybody stopped doing it, because nobody, we would get along fine if everybody stopped fleeing and stopped engaging in idle talk, curiosity, and so-and-so.

715
01:06:13,081 --> 01:06:15,641
But Tyler and then Curtis, yeah, Tyler.

716
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,721
Okay, and then you're here.

717
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,520
Oh, good.

718
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:23,480
Let's try.

719
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:33,721
The inauthenticity, is that the sentence?

720
01:06:35,681 --> 01:06:43,161
In terms of inauthenticity, not authenticity by virtue.

721
01:07:01,121 --> 01:07:04,321
Where is it the being no longer in?

722
01:07:06,001 --> 01:07:07,280
I don't know.

723
01:07:14,001 --> 01:07:15,040
I see.

724
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,800
Hmm.

725
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:26,560
Well, okay, but this kind is a falling away, but well, let's just let me know what Curtis has to say.

726
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:27,201
Yeah.

727
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,841
Sorry, go ahead.

728
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:32,881
What?

729
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:37,201
It's not a pivot thing?

730
01:07:37,201 --> 01:07:39,921
Wait, wait, maybe it'll stop and I can hear you.

731
01:07:40,561 --> 01:07:41,921
Okay, here, now.

732
01:07:45,121 --> 01:07:46,961
Wait, well, let's wait one more.

733
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,601
Try again.

734
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,961
Positive and event that is constitutive.

735
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:51,920
It's not pivotive.

736
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,840
It constitutes the being of Dasein.

737
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:06,321
So just like idle talk makes possible this idea of everyday being, fallenness also constitutes Daseine, the way of being absorbed in the world.

738
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,161
Well, it's constitutive of average everydayness, but we could get along.

739
01:08:10,641 --> 01:08:12,401
Can we get along without it or not?

740
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,280
It's part of our structure of being Dasein.

741
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,961
That's why it uses positive.

742
01:08:19,201 --> 01:08:22,400
All this is positive in the sense of ontological structure.

743
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,161
And Daseine.

744
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,960
Okay, and falling is a positive structure.

745
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:28,841
Now, why is falling a positive structure?

746
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:30,440
Tyler is saying no.

747
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,320
A positive is an existential modification of a basic structure.

748
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:51,241
Well, that sounds promising, but now Eugene, think, what do you think?

749
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,921
That's primitive, because you're not really being a subject.

750
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:00,520
That's what it is to sort of write.

751
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:04,841
It's just the minus of the positive thing, which is being a subject.

752
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:18,760
Okay.

753
01:09:20,041 --> 01:09:22,121
But okay, now just help me.

754
01:09:22,121 --> 01:09:36,921
But this kind of positive turns out to be like the negative in whereas we've got to keep remembering that, whereas in the first half of this lecture, this lecture has a confusing character.

755
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:39,640
I'm afraid it's not, I mean, I think it's not my fault.

756
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:41,241
I'd be glad if it were.

757
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:53,400
The positive is the middle kind of thing, which for intelligibility, remember, we always have to deal with situations that we're not in and talk about things that we're not skilled at.

758
01:09:53,400 --> 01:10:02,520
And that's doubly positive, I guess, because it's positive in the sense that it's a possibility for Dasein.

759
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:07,560
And it's a good possibility because our culture depends, our social world depends on it.

760
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:17,840
Now, there are other positive possibilities for Daseheim, which we're now reading about, and they are being involved in idle thought, curiosity, and ambiguity.

761
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:21,201
And it looks like we don't need them.

762
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:24,400
They aren't what's holding up our culture.

763
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:38,560
But they're still positive, even though they don't have a constitutive function in having average everydayness.

764
01:10:40,081 --> 01:10:41,440
We go, okay.

765
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,360
Because, hmm, hmm, hmm.

766
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:49,520
Okay, I don't want to, there's a further weird thing, but I don't want to say it.

767
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:49,760
Yeah.

768
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:54,720
Make something clear.

769
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,520
Good.

770
01:10:56,961 --> 01:11:05,201
221 people were not making the same phenomenon for falling.

771
01:11:05,201 --> 01:11:10,800
This whole paragraph you talked about falling constitutes.

772
01:11:10,801 --> 01:11:14,241
Yes, polling is an existential characteristic of Dasein itself.

773
01:11:14,241 --> 01:11:15,360
I read that on 220.

774
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,201
Okay, it's the same point.

775
01:11:18,161 --> 01:11:18,720
Yeah, I did it.

776
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:20,081
I said I misspoke.

777
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:21,440
Existential, yeah.

778
01:11:30,801 --> 01:11:34,961
Logically, that's how I'm reading the idle thought and fallingness here.

779
01:11:35,121 --> 01:11:38,161
You clearly said it's part of the constitutive structure.

780
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,081
You see this phenomenon, you realize without it, you weren't really.

781
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:56,081
Well, that's what I don't understand, because I don't think authentic Dasein is in, it has the structure, it deals in idle thought, curiosity, and ambiguity.

782
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,241
Exactly.

783
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,680
He does too.

784
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,400
Okay.

785
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:12,920
Okay.

786
01:12:12,921 --> 01:12:15,560
Well, we have the capacity to fall.

787
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,800
That's not the same as fallenness, where fallenness is, you've already done it.

788
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,440
I mean, I don't know what he thinks.

789
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:30,921
Fallenness and sending out the possibility for falling in the positive side of the structure of Dodd Zign.

790
01:12:31,001 --> 01:12:33,480
It's positive and intensive without falling.

791
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:36,280
So, but witch falling.

792
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:43,480
I mean, surely it's positive that we have to fall into work and fall into the flow, and we have to conform to the norms.

793
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,840
That's all positive.

794
01:12:44,841 --> 01:12:49,241
But does this positive?

795
01:12:53,560 --> 01:13:05,560
That possibility, yes, that capacity is part of the structure of Dasein in a funny way, because this is really, this is the basic thing that's hard to get your head around.

796
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,560
It's not a structure that every Dasein has.

797
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,161
That would be existencial.

798
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,440
It isn't a structure constitutive of Dasein.

799
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:20,520
It's a capacity or a tendency, more like a tendency that every Dasein has.

800
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:28,680
And unless you resist this tendency, you will get, you will become a conformist and you will become whatever else.

801
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:32,360
You will watch talk shows and blogs and all that.

802
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,440
But you don't have to do that.

803
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:43,680
So this peculiar thing, an ontological structure of Dasein, which you don't have to have to be Dasein.

804
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:48,720
All you have to have to be Dasein is a tendency toward that structure.

805
01:13:43,161 --> 01:13:50,081
That's what you're saying.

806
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,680
That is your point.

807
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,921
Boy, I don't like it, but I can see that there is such a point.

808
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,720
I mostly wish there were better words for it.

809
01:13:59,121 --> 01:14:08,560
The existencia, I think, ought to be actual ontological constitutive structures of every Dasein to be Dasein.

810
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:13,760
I don't think the capacities and tendencies ought to be in there.

811
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,280
That's right.

812
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,320
Well, this isn't a condition of the possibility.

813
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:34,161
It's a condition of Dasein, which is a possibility, but it isn't something that you have to have in order to be Dasein, I don't think.

814
01:14:34,881 --> 01:14:37,360
Wait, I guess that's how we disagree.

815
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,400
But let me try again.

816
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:52,480
Do you have to have idle talk, curiosity, ambiguity, and all this bottom groundless cover-up in order to be Dasein?

817
01:14:53,680 --> 01:15:00,241
Yes, but that isn't, having the possibility for that isn't something like what makes Dasein possible.

818
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:02,640
That's like a bad joke.

819
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,600
Okay, well, that's what we disagree about.

820
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:19,121
Okay, let's have if we have trouble defining what's positive about this, or how it might be positive, what do you mean by positive?

821
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:22,800
We can look at what might be negative, what the opposite would be.

822
01:15:22,801 --> 01:15:29,880
And it seems, given the contrast that he puts up earlier in the paragraph, where he says this isn't not being, it's still being in the world.

823
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:37,480
It seems like the only thing that would be negative would be if somehow fallenness made you not in the world or deworlded somehow.

824
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:41,880
And it seems like his emphasis is that, in fact, this isn't de-worlding at all.

825
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,800
Even being a good former is a kind of being in the world.

826
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:52,280
And in that sense, it's a positive possibility because it's still a way most often it takes a stance on its own being.

827
01:15:53,241 --> 01:15:53,720
Okay.

828
01:15:54,360 --> 01:16:14,680
I think that's a diff that issue is clearer than this other issue, which is a different one about sort of to what extent the way of being that is a kind of falling away from Dasein, a fleeing, an attempt to cover up its nature, to what it, how to how to describe that.

829
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:20,600
Remember, the problem is, well, it's it's, I think it's not existential.

830
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:29,800
Well, I guess some way I can agree with Curtis, it's not existential as something that is constitutive of Dasein.

831
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:31,961
It doesn't have to do that.

832
01:16:31,961 --> 01:16:34,680
It can live in a genuine, authentic way.

833
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,840
However, the tendency toward it is an existential.

834
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,241
That's that much we agree about.

835
01:16:41,241 --> 01:16:51,320
Let me jump, because time is two minutes from up, to a place where Heidegger seems to be actually thinking about this and facing up to this puzzle.

836
01:16:51,320 --> 01:17:01,800
On 229, I'm not, now that we've had this whole discussion, this will either turn out to be less interesting or more interesting than it was when I read it this morning.

837
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:04,600
So let's start at the top of 229.

838
01:17:05,881 --> 01:17:07,560
I'm going to read that whole paragraph real fast.

839
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:15,121
Since our aim is to proceed toward the being of the totality of the structural whole, we'll take as our point of departure the concrete analysis of falling we've just carried through.

840
01:17:15,121 --> 01:17:19,840
Now, Dasein's absorption in the one and its absorption in the world of its concern.

841
01:17:19,841 --> 01:17:33,360
Notice he's got these two absorptions named and in there, make manifest something like a fleeing of Dasein in the face of itself, of itself as an authentic ability to be.

842
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:40,880
So there is a kind of negative-ish something, and it isn't something that Dasein always does.

843
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:42,400
It's a possibility.

844
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:52,081
Now, this phenomenon of Dasein's fleeing in the face of itself and in the face of its authenticity seems at least a suitable phenomenal basis for the following investigation.

845
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:58,720
But to bring itself face to face with itself is precisely what Dasein does not do when it thus flees.

846
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,480
It turns away from itself in accordance with its own most inertia.

847
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,081
That is, it has a tendency to do this, but it resists it.

848
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,241
Now comes the sentence I wanted to get to.

849
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:27,440
In investigating such phenomena, however, we must be careful not to confuse ontico-existential characterization with ontologico-existential interpretation, nor may we overlook the positive phenomenal basis provided for this interpretation by such a characterization.

850
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,400
You see how that's all concerned with what we were just talking about.

851
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:35,280
It says you don't want to confuse, it's sort of what Curtis and I were talking about.

852
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:44,001
You don't want to confuse the existential structure of Dasein with some existential tendencies of Dasein.

853
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:52,000
The existential structure is the ontico-existential story he's trying to tell.

854
01:18:52,001 --> 01:18:56,081
You don't want to confuse that with the ontico-existential characterization.

855
01:18:56,081 --> 01:18:58,600
That's when he's saying generally Dasein is this.

856
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,840
For the most part, Dasein is this.

857
01:19:00,841 --> 01:19:11,960
And he wants to say, and this general way that Dasein is for the most part can be a positive phenomenological basis for the interpretation.

858
01:19:11,961 --> 01:19:12,920
Isn't that neat?

859
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:16,040
That is sort of a rigid designation.

860
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:27,000
I mean, you start with average everydayness and all these sort of negative seeming ways that Dasein is fleeing and covering up and falling and so forth.

861
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:37,881
And you use them to lead you to talking about an essential ontological existential constitutive structure of Dasein.

862
01:19:37,961 --> 01:19:45,320
You want to say one word because I think yes, it's now.

863
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,520
Yes, it's positive because you can use it as a formal indicator.

864
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:56,920
You can start with these, what Dasein generally is, and then you can see that Dasein has a tendency to do all these things.

865
01:19:56,921 --> 01:20:03,241
And from there, you can see what the structure of Daseine necessarily existential is.

866
01:20:03,241 --> 01:20:04,280
That's what I have.

867
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,081
I just betrayed.

868
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,520
I think we're agreeing.

869
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,400
That's amazing.

870
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:07,880
Okay.

871
01:20:07,881 --> 01:20:08,840
Socrates.
