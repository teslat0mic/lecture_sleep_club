1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
And what I want to cover today is meaning, which I had already talked about once, but I want to say a little more about it.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,359
And then going on to understanding and interpretation, which I've already said a lot about, but I still need to say something more about it.

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:28,479
And finally, to discourse, which is the section you were supposed to read for this week, about which there's lots to say, and I will start on it.

4
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,999
There it goes, being in time.

5
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,559
It is decomposed.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,479
Okay, let me recompose it.

7
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,319
Yeah, okay, maybe.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:59,119
So, meaning is so strange a chapter in here.

9
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:25,199
I told you, Heidegger is just trying to take over this, the word zen in German, the word for meaning, take it over from this inner mental content that it has for Ussero, and as it has for Searle, and as it has had in Heidegger's time anyway, for the Germans and the analytic continent, Anglo-American philosophers, and give it a new meaning.

10
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:39,160
And it's because he wants to say that things are intelligible on the basis, not of some inner content, but, and we'll come back to this again from all kinds of angles.

11
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:46,359
But the familiar world is rock bottom for him as to what is intelligible.

12
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:51,479
And the familiar world, and what right has he got to say that the familiar world is intelligible?

13
00:01:51,479 --> 00:02:04,439
Well, he would just say, just look, I'm doing the phenomenology I'm describing, I'm telling you that you just look at the familiar, the everyday world, and you will see that it's intelligible.

14
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,879
You would help to see it if I could see the page numbers here that I want to read.

15
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,400
I want to read 193, but I, for a minute, when those pages have disappeared.

16
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,720
Aha, here we are.

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,639
Things.

18
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,679
Looking promising, yes.

19
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,160
Okay.

20
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,120
On 193, I'm just trying to explain what he says.

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,679
Oh, yeah, okay.

22
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm trying to explain this italics, this very obscure-sounding sentence.

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,800
We're starting on the third line on 193.

24
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:51,640
I'm in the lower half of 151 in the German.

25
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,239
So, top of 193, very top, I'll start.

26
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,559
Meaning is that wherein the intelligibility of something maintains itself.

27
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:04,280
That's supposed to be such a general definition that it could cover anybody.

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,559
But then he's got his own version, skipping a sentence.

29
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:17,679
The concept of meaning embraces, this is his concept, the formal existential structure of what necessarily belongs to that which an understanding interpretation articulates.

30
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:31,440
And then in italics, meaning is the, on the basis of which, of a projection, in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something.

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,239
Now, that I had read already last time, but I just wanted to tell you that then comes this new thing.

32
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,439
It gets its structure from forehaving foresight and foreconception.

33
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:53,360
I felt I couldn't just leave you with those words, which seemed to be saying something important, without telling you why they got suddenly dumped in here.

34
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:56,239
He hasn't said anything about that before.

35
00:03:56,559 --> 00:04:06,239
It's a new vocabulary for talking about this ultimate background structure of the familiar world.

36
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:21,679
And as he says, insofar as understanding, next sentence, insofar as understanding and interpretation make up the existential state of being the there, meaning is the formal existential framework of the disclosiveness which belongs to understanding.

37
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,160
Now, all this is just saying the same thing over and over again.

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,200
He's named this worldhood already.

39
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
He's called it, he's talked about disclosing already.

40
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,720
And he said that those belong to the basic structure of Dasein.

41
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,799
Now he says it again, meaning is an existentiale of Dasein.

42
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:54,479
But now he's contrasting it with the usual sense, not a property attaching to entities, lying behind them or floating somewhere in an indeterminate domain, which is where they were for Husserl, some kind of strange abstract entities.

43
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:59,119
For him, he's trying to say, no, that's just the structure of the world.

44
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:10,280
The phenomenon of everyday dealing has its own structure, and now Heidegger's going to name this structure in a new way.

45
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,999
It's got forehaving.

46
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,999
Where does he first say that now?

47
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:15,960
Oh, yeah, right up there.

48
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,559
It gets its structure from forehaving, foresight, and foreconception.

49
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,559
I'll say a word about each one.

50
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:25,479
I'm not terribly sure what they all mean because he doesn't tell you.

51
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,040
He just sort of dumps them into the discussion.

52
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,479
But it's always good to have a guess as to what they mean.

53
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:40,119
And then if it turns out that there's some passage somewhere that makes this interpretation wrong or supports it, you've got something to go on.

54
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:43,400
Forehaving is the most basic.

55
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,679
And it's something that you've always got, and you're always already in it.

56
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:53,559
Or I even like to think it's not something you have.

57
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:56,040
It's more like what has you.

58
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
And what would that be?

59
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,080
Well, I guess that's familiarity.

60
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,759
That is, another way to put it is, we're always already in a network of solicitations.

61
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:17,720
It's the same thing, I think, that he calls primary understanding, except he's talking about the whole of it and not one example of it.

62
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:26,599
And the whole of primary understanding, all the interrelated network of solicitations, is the familiarity you've got with the world.

63
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:36,840
I mean, the door is soliciting you to go out when that's appropriate, and the windows to close them when that's appropriate, and the seats to sit in when that's appropriate, and the floor to walk on when that's appropriate.

64
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,199
All of that added up, adds up to familiarity, and you've always already got it.

65
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,199
That doesn't mean that you were born understanding doors and windows and chairs and all that.

66
00:06:47,439 --> 00:07:04,000
You got it gradually, and as you got Dasein gradually, from the moment you came out of the womb until you were had enough familiarity to have a world, and you were you, and period, for that.

67
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,280
And now, and what is foresight?

68
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:20,160
Well, it's probably got to do with circumspection, which is a way of picking up some aspect of the familiarity.

69
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,280
So, in familiar rooms, doors solicit us to go out when it's appropriate, and chairs to sit on when it's appropriate.

70
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,080
And we can notice the chairs and make assertions about them as comfortable or not.

71
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:40,640
But that's going to come up again on page 199, but I don't want to jump to it there here.

72
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,320
And foreconception.

73
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:52,799
Well, to begin with, the German is for griff, and it's true that a concept is a budgriff in German, but for conception hasn't got anything to do with concepts.

74
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:55,120
It's supposed to be more basic than concepts.

75
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,320
So, we have to call it something like a four grass.

76
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,599
But then we have to make up some kind of story.

77
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,679
What could he have in mind there?

78
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:10,880
These are all kinds of subtle distinctions in which he's just describing the same thing over and over, emphasizing different angles.

79
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,400
So, he's got familiarity, he's got circumspection.

80
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,120
This one might be assignment.

81
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:24,240
That is, remember, that we've got a four, the door has a four watt, namely to go in and out.

82
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:55,000
And the whole assignment structure is having done the sort of in circumspection, that means sort of seeing around, having done the whole aroundness of the background, which with all of its system of solicitations, he's now going to pick out the fact that it's some you're you're noticing or responding to something that's also not, if you could sort of help, if it helps to have this sort of spatial thing, it's not what you see around you.

83
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:06,280
The four concept, the foregrings is where you are placed in the chain of in order-to's.

84
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,439
That is, that now we're going to emphasize that the door is the to go out, and the latch, well, let's start.

85
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:42,840
The latch is to open the door, the door is to go out, the to go out leads to the front steps, and that goes toward this, leads you toward the street and toward the grocer, and that's, and finally, it leads you to getting to the for the sake of which, for getting something to eat, and ultimately to the ultimate for the sake of which, if you've gone out the door and go through all that to get to the grocer, because you understand yourself as the family provider.

86
00:09:42,839 --> 00:10:06,679
So, in that chain, you have a chain of assignments, and those are, and anywhere in that chain, you can talk about the foregrasp, because wherever you are in the chain, the whole chain is already being taken into account in what you're doing.

87
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,640
I don't find that, I mean, and it may be my fault, I don't know.

88
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,560
If you don't find this very illuminating, it's somebody's fault, either Heidegger's or mine.

89
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:26,080
I mean, it seems to me it's just renaming phenomena that we already know, and I don't really see that it, and I'm not sure how he's renaming them, and I'm not sure why he's renaming them.

90
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,320
So, but I've done the best I can since you have to deal with this.

91
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:34,160
And every once in a while, he brings up the forehaving and the foreseeing.

92
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,800
Yeah.

93
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,600
Well, there are yes and no.

94
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,240
I didn't want to think back into this, but I'll say it one more time.

95
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:12,560
There's a certain way in which, yes, you're always seeing as, and you're always picking up the as structure of the world and responding to it.

96
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:18,000
So, in some way, you're taking account of the door as to go out.

97
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:31,519
But in your actual experience, when you're most in flow, when you're most dealing, and everything is going fine, that doesn't show up in your experience that there's a door.

98
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:49,119
Here, the way to think about it is that to go out is what you experience, and you don't need to experience, well, better, and so there is a solicitation to go out, but you don't experience it as a solicitation, you just experience the pull to go out.

99
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,520
You're just pulled to go out, and you don't experience it as a solicitation by the door.

100
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:04,280
That is, you don't experience it in terms of the solicitor, but all you do is you respond to the pull to go out.

101
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:07,559
And the government, not as the pull to go out, you just respond.

102
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:17,160
And that's so on the level of describing what goes on when you're most coping or dealing, the as structure isn't in there.

103
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:35,560
But on the other hand, when you spell it out from either by your reflecting on it, and the door gets stuck and you realize that you've been taking it as a door, or when somebody else sees what you're doing, they would say, well, you're going out and you're doing that by taking the door as a door.

104
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,439
That's fine.

105
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,480
Don't worry about it.

106
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:48,440
I mean, he just, they're just two different ways of talking about or levels or something.

107
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:51,720
And I don't think we want to, I don't want to talk about it anymore.

108
00:12:52,359 --> 00:13:15,799
The main point is: if there's anything new, it's just a new sort of polemical point that once you see the structure of everyday familiarity and everyday coping, which we just did, see, in terms of this new language, what he calls the force structure of those three somethings.

109
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:27,720
Once you see that, then you see that you don't need to introduce any intentional content to explain the way we relate to things.

110
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,479
You just need to describe it.

111
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:47,440
It's only if you think of us as minds apart from a meaning a world, that then you have to worry about how the mind gets directed towards the objects in the world and how the objects in the world get taken to be something and as something.

112
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:50,720
But all that's, so to speak, always already done.

113
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,560
And you don't have to ask how we do it.

114
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,960
Now, I always want to say that doesn't mean that you can't ask how the brain does it.

115
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:11,680
It's always important to realize that there may be, there is presumably another level of description of all this, but the philosopher's mistake is to ask how the mind does it.

116
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,360
And the mind doesn't do it.

117
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,960
Dasein does it.

118
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,440
And Dasein is this being that's already grown up in a familiar world.

119
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:28,800
So it's a kind of, as I call it, a myth of the mental, to think that you need what?

120
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:37,040
You need something in the mind, which Husserl called intentional content, and Searle calls intentional content, and so does a lot of people in analytic.

121
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:56,319
And intentional content is this mental something that is self-sufficient and inner, and it's the content of a mind, and it directs the mind toward objects in the world.

122
00:14:56,319 --> 00:15:09,520
And Heidegger thinks you don't need it, and also he thinks that if you had it, it wouldn't do you any good because it's just sort of renaming what is equally still mysterious.

123
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,120
Husserl thought it was mysterious.

124
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,160
He thought it was Linderbar, and there was nothing you could say about it.

125
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:23,199
Isn't it amazing that the intentional content in the mind reaches out and directs our mind toward objects in the external world?

126
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,240
But that's, Heidegger would say, that's not helpful.

127
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,319
I mean, you just invented something that's supposed to do the job, but you can't even explain how it does the job, and you don't need it.

128
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:43,719
This is what he's saying when he says, I just read it, meaning is an existentiale, not a property, attending to entities lying behind them, and so forth and so forth.

129
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,799
None of that would do any good.

130
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,040
Okay, Dave, yeah.

131
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,119
What do you think?

132
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,439
Might there be a danger as a myth of fruit crack.

133
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,839
In other words, do you think that meaning is simply a fruit bracket?

134
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,400
Yes, but I don't think it's a myth.

135
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,559
I mean, I think the question is: this is phenomenology.

136
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,520
What do you think?

137
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,399
Do you think, how do you experience this as a presumably as a room with seats that are appropriate to sit in?

138
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,079
And, you know, going through all that litany of, again, but I mean, that's not a myth.

139
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,880
It's hardly even a fact.

140
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,079
It's a phenomenon.

141
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,639
It's something that in Heidegger jargon shows itself as it is in itself.

142
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:35,720
And I think the point is supposed to be, and that's where you start.

143
00:16:35,720 --> 00:17:00,600
Now, if there's some reason to doubt the phenomenon, if somebody convinces you on the basis of after images or dreams, like Descartes tried to do, that you couldn't be really open to a world, because although you could have the same experiences if you were asleep or if there were no world or if you were in the matrix, then if you then you have to sort of defend, you have to argue against that view.

144
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:06,359
You have to say, well, that's all parasitical on my general openness to the world, or something like that.

145
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,640
And you've got to say, well, if you've got that problem, Descartes, then you've got a big problem.

146
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:20,960
And saying, well, thanks to intentional content, it's all going to be, we're going to get out of this somehow isn't helpful.

147
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,719
Now, you, yeah, I don't understand, so I don't understand what you're thinking.

148
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:37,040
You say, yes, there's meaning, but in order to account for me, and that forest structure is a structure of subjection.

149
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,799
Do you give an account of, in effect, the genesis of a topic?

150
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,359
Oh, well, I'm not convinced of this at all.

151
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,599
I don't think the forest structure he calls it projection.

152
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,760
That's his name for it.

153
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,879
But for him, projection isn't something that the inner mind projects with its meaning on the external world.

154
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:08,639
So it doesn't, I mean, how does it help any?

155
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:19,839
How could it be true that this familiarity, which we've always had already as long as we've been Dasein, could be anything that we project on the bare facts?

156
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:22,400
There's no reason to think there are any bare facts.

157
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,079
We got to that last time.

158
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,240
No brute given, and there's nothing for us to do to make the brute given meaningful.

159
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,760
There's no space in there for a problem, he thinks.

160
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:44,479
It seems like in the way the artwork shows the point that's out of sign is displois or for frameworks explosion and so forth.

161
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,679
But that the idea of displays would be in place on it.

162
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,520
Yes, something like that is fine.

163
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:12,359
Clearly, if it weren't for us, Daseins, there wouldn't be a shared, meaningful world.

164
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:19,719
There would just be brute stuff, electrons and galaxies and trees and dogs and stuff.

165
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:30,839
And there's certain, and even, I'm not even sure how much, that might be the wrong way to describe them, the way you've got to describe them, the way Searle does in this orifice making the acoustic blast.

166
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,240
But there would just be meaningless stuff.

167
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,199
And thanks to Dasein being around, there isn't meaningless stuff.

168
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:49,399
And I think the mistake is to think that you need some kind of explanation of how Dasein does it, how Dasein does this disclosing.

169
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:51,559
Because I don't think he's got an explanation.

170
00:19:51,559 --> 00:20:03,079
He just keeps telling you the structure of the disclosing, that it's familiarity, it's got a referential totality, it's got, and now it's, and our relation to it has got a force structure.

171
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:18,040
But none of that, I think, sort of tells you anything like explaining how there is this disclosed world.

172
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:26,040
Those are just all descriptive versions of aspects and structures of this disclosed world.

173
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,480
And that's the, but it's important to discuss this.

174
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:38,359
That's why he says this, why he wants to have this notion of meaning as basic, because that's something that they all seem to agree on.

175
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:47,119
We somehow put meaning onto things or into things, but you've got to be so careful.

176
00:20:47,440 --> 00:21:05,760
You don't want there's meaning is the upon which of a projection, in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something, and that's it's the most general statement you can say.

177
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:14,879
And in turn, I'm just trying to hear this from your perspective, which is important.

178
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:26,479
Meaning is the on the basis of which of a projection, in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something.

179
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,079
And now, what I'm still trying to get used to this, and it's an existential of Dasein.

180
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,000
That's the important thing.

181
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,240
And that means as soon as there's Dasein, there's meaning.

182
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,999
And without Dasein, there wouldn't be any meaning.

183
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,520
And that's all right.

184
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,760
I mean, that's true.

185
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:11,839
And it doesn't now help to jump in with a story like you get in, let's say, Kant, of how the mind structures the data to give us a meaningful world.

186
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,799
Or you don't have, I mean, or Husserl or any of these philosophers.

187
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:32,119
It's only just Dasein as not individual Daseins, but Dasein, that there's Dasein at all, that makes it have this meaningful, makes, discloses a meaningful structure.

188
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,160
I don't know if that's any help.

189
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:43,319
You just got to resist trying to give an explanation of it in terms of some kind of inter inner mental content.

190
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,040
Yeah, Tyler, do you want to say something about this?

191
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,240
I think your brain said everything.

192
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,520
Ah, interesting.

193
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,639
That's good.

194
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:14,919
I see what you're saying.

195
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:24,520
Yes, there's something mysterious about how light dawns gradually over the whole, that you can't give, nobody can give a story.

196
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:44,520
The clearest example of the mystery that's still left when Heidegger's got his story is nobody knows a story of how language could develop, because it looks like you've always got to be at least sensitive to language to start out with, but you can't understand how you could, where that comes from.

197
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,920
And you don't understand either, step by step, how light dawns on the whole.

198
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:55,399
Nobody's got a story about how any civilization developed the language that it's got.

199
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,479
So the developmental story is still mysterious.

200
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,399
And there must be one, I suppose.

201
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm not sure whether there must be one or not, but I don't see why not.

202
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:14,040
It's funny that if there is, nobody's come across it or even claims to have it.

203
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,760
But whatever, it's a different kind of mystery.

204
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,359
And I just try this.

205
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,559
You're throwing these interesting hard things at me.

206
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:31,760
It's not the kind of mystery to which you can find some kind of mental solution.

207
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:41,199
That's what he's got against the literal Kant, thorough intellectualist, Merlot Ponty would call it, approach to all this.

208
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,680
It's let me see if I can say more about it.

209
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,840
So, oh, oh, yeah, and it's the kind of mystery which he can just put a shove aside.

210
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,119
That's the important thing.

211
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,040
He's going to say, I'm doing phenomenology.

212
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,119
I'm not going to do this developmental stuff.

213
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:59,200
Sure, it's hard.

214
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,639
You can call it a mystery if you want, depending on whether you've got some kind of argument that you couldn't get the developmental story right about language.

215
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,879
But it's not my business, he wants to say.

216
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,960
And that's important, I think.

217
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,479
The mystery can be shoved off on neuroscience, which hasn't a clue, but might get an answer on its level someday.

218
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,879
Developmental psychology, which hasn't a clue, but maybe it could get an answer someday.

219
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:28,240
But Heidegger wants to say that's certainly, whatever it is, it's not philosopher's business.

220
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:47,520
And the mistake of the myth of the mental is to think that there must be a story about how each of us, with our minds, imposes this order on some kind of unstructured, what Husserl calls hyletic, meaning matter, unstructured matter, and Kant has unstructured matter, and Husserl has unstructured matter.

221
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,200
But that's just a story from Heidegger's point of view.

222
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,160
We never got any experience of unstructured matter and imposing order on it.

223
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:56,399
Yeah.

224
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,399
That's a helpful point.

225
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,160
Okay.

226
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,919
That's good.

227
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,520
That's another way to repeat the same point, but importantly, another way.

228
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,599
That's the solicitation story.

229
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:44,120
There isn't sort of solicitations don't come divided up into the object doing the soliciting and the mind being solicited.

230
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:55,399
When we are involved and absorbed in coping, there is just the two go out and the going out is all one experience.

231
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:02,280
That's another way of saying, at his level of description, this issue of how to do it.

232
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:09,559
I mean, explaining it doesn't matter because he's got a phenomenological description, and that's all he needs.

233
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,639
And I keep coming back to this.

234
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:24,199
If the intellectualists, the cognitive scientists, the neuroscientists, if they had some story about how it would happen, I don't think he would mind.

235
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,840
But he would still say, yeah, but I don't care.

236
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,839
I'm doing the phenomenology of this.

237
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,359
And congratulations.

238
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,520
Well, not to the intellectualist.

239
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,040
I mean, I take that back.

240
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,679
The intellectualist is making up a story about how the mind does it.

241
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:48,079
And he's going to resist that because he thinks that after, from Descartes through Husserl, people have had that story and it doesn't work and we don't need it.

242
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,600
Somebody down here wants to say something.

243
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,159
Yeah.

244
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,520
You were saying that the mind imposes meaning of things.

245
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,319
If you're pleased up with the brain, that wouldn't find it.

246
00:27:58,879 --> 00:27:59,760
Well, I think so.

247
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,280
Though I realize I'm going way out on a limb.

248
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:22,319
The reason I think so is tied up with what won't really come up until the reality chapter, that whether Heidegger thinks that there is a universe out there which has the natural kinds in it with causal properties.

249
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,119
I mean, I think he thinks, yeah, the brain is a part of the universe, and it has its causal properties.

250
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:33,359
And if we only understood it, maybe we'd understand how it causes us to have experiences.

251
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:39,280
The one thing he would resist, it's important to add, is he wouldn't be a reductionist.

252
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,600
He wouldn't say, aha, then now we understand meaning and world and all that.

253
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,360
The phenomena would be as unintelligible as ever.

254
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,199
We would just understand the causal basis of it, and that would be nice.

255
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Just as what it is to be a hammer can't be reduced to the shank and the blob and the physical properties of shanks and blobs and nails.

256
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:19,919
And Heidegger wouldn't nothing science could come up would convince Heidegger that the world disclosed by Dasein could be explained by any present-of-hand facts about nature.

257
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,799
He says that in Norman or something.

258
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,479
Worldhood can never be understood in terms of nature.

259
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,040
That is something like we're going to get to today in another version.

260
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:43,799
The richness of meaning is something that you can't ever understand in the impoverishedness of the present-of-hand and its law-like relations.

261
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:49,079
So even if you had them, you couldn't use them to get back the richness of meaning.

262
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:53,079
I think I will jump to a quote which I think is very important and interesting.

263
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:58,119
I didn't expect to get here till much later, but why not read it right now?

264
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:15,879
If I could find it, I would find 121.

265
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,839
This is apropos of what we've been talking about.

266
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:28,439
About 10 lines from the bottom, middle of 88 in the German, on page 121 at the bottom in English.

267
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:37,639
The context of assignments or references, which as significance is constituted for worldhood, can be taken formally in the sense of a system of relations.

268
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:51,000
But one must note that such formalizations and phenomena get leveled off when their real phenomenal content, by the way, this is not against science.

269
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,240
This happens to be against some cognitivist AI view.

270
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,000
But you could talk about either doing it with rules, informal, or with laws.

271
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,439
It would be the same thing.

272
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:10,040
But we note that such formalizations, the phenomena get leveled off so that their real phenomenal content gets lost.

273
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,280
That's how it is in German.

274
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:15,960
Especially in the case of such simple relations as lurk and significance.

275
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:28,719
The phenomenal content of these relations in Relata, the in order to, the for the sake of, the with-which, and involvement, is such that they resist any sort of mathematical functionalization.

276
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,119
I think that means mathematical science and also artificial intelligence.

277
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,440
Nor are they merely something thought, first posited in an act of thinking.

278
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,599
That is, they're not sort of organized by concepts.

279
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:49,119
They are relationships in which concernful circumspection as such already dwells.

280
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:59,200
That's just another way of saying he realizes that he's got a story which and that's the story we're going to have today, so this is all a kind of overture.

281
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:05,920
He's got a story about how much you have to leave out to get to science and logic.

282
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,040
This one happens to be about logic, but any formalization.

283
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:13,599
You have to decontextualize.

284
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,280
You have to de-world.

285
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:37,840
You have to leave so much out that you can't, there would be, there's no reason to think, and every reason to doubt that you could ever get it back, get the world back, meaning back, and the hammering back from the residue that science and logic operate with.

286
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,719
That's an important, important claim.

287
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:41,119
Yeah.

288
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,319
Well, this must be what currents everything has the brain to do it, right?

289
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:06,200
But if all this complicated meaning and things are possible in the brain and they only function for the business, why not everything?

290
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,079
That's hard.

291
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:09,959
That's hard.

292
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:19,000
It's that when you describe, and it's important, but unfortunately, we shouldn't spend too much time on it because Heidegger doesn't.

293
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:28,199
But there's some there though he would say that the is it's sort of how many have had Davidson in any course?

294
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:51,480
It's a kind of it's a kind of it's a kind of point that says he would make the point that this holism of meaning, even if it's somehow underlain causally by a holism in the brain, can be, the two holisms can't be mapped upon each other in any law-like way.

295
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,839
That's the Davidson argument.

296
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
That's what you'd have to say.

297
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:08,439
So you've got sort of, to talk like David said, any given experience would be identical with something going on in the brain, but there'd be no law-like description of how all of experience is related to all of what's going on in the brain.

298
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,880
You see that.

299
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,720
Okay, now I saw another hand.

300
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,719
But this is really, this last question.

301
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,040
Let's hear this, but then I have to go on.

302
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,760
No amount of empirical evidence could support the intellectual conclusion.

303
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,960
He's asking, okay.

304
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:32,679
Stephen is asking, is Heidegger saying that no amount of evidence could support the intellectualist conclusion?

305
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:50,160
The intellectualist being the one who thinks that there are these meanings in the mind, these rules that the mind uses to organize the hyletic data, the unstructured matter that we experience when the world impinges on us.

306
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,400
What would Heidegger say about it?

307
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,880
Well, isn't it interesting?

308
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,960
I mean, I think Heidegger would say, and I think I've got the place, I was reading you, in effect, the place where he says it.

309
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,800
But first, I'll say it my way.

310
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:19,120
You can't prove that artificial intelligence, that is, to explain, give the whole logical structure of intelligibility in terms of formal relations, you can't prove that that's impossible.

311
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,719
And you can't prove that cognitivism is impossible.

312
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:27,920
If you could, you could write the proof and they could read it, and then they would all have to go home and give up.

313
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:43,520
What you can do is tell a story in which it looks terribly implausible and list all the ways that they failed and are failing to do it, and point out that that's just the sort of failures you'd expect if it was, it turns out, that you can't do it.

314
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,559
That's what I did in my book, What Computers Can't Do.

315
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:55,279
And I carefully never said computers can't be programmed to be intelligent, because I can't see how you could ever have an argument like that.

316
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:58,720
And I don't think Heidegger has an argument like that.

317
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:11,439
And that's why, now I want to go back that the cautious and the interesting way he puts this on 121 is that the real phenomenal content, and the English makes it even more cautious.

318
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,959
It says may be lost.

319
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,640
It's a little stronger than that.

320
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,760
It's that their phenomenal content gets lost.

321
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,320
But he doesn't say must get lost.

322
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,880
It's a very cautious statement.

323
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,599
And it's all like that.

324
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:33,079
Notice on the next page that the for the sake of which and so forth resists any sort of mathematical functionalization.

325
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,119
Isn't that interesting?

326
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:39,960
He could have said just can't be formalized, that he'd have no right to say just can't be formalized.

327
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,880
So he says just what he ought to say: that it doesn't look like there's any way it can be formalized.

328
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,320
I'm glad you asked.

329
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:51,160
Now, we're going back onward, wherever we were.

330
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:55,160
I think I've covered, but I have to see now what I've done.

331
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

332
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,240
Yeah.

333
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,800
Okay, now we're ready for the derivation of logic.

334
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:25,320
And that is exactly what we should, which is going to be the argument that step by step, so much is left out in order to arrive at subjects, or that is substances with properties, so that you can have a predicate calculus of the substances and their properties.

335
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:47,400
So much of our everyday experience is left out that it's crazy to think, or utterly implausible to think, that you could use this minimal related stuff to give a description of all of intelligibility, to program a computer, in effect, to understand our language, our world, and act in it, and so forth.

336
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,040
So now we're going to do the derivation of logic.

337
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:59,720
It's also going to be, it has two functions, it seems to me, that it's also going to answer an important question.

338
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:05,520
If our basic way of being in the world is dealing with familiarity.

339
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:26,319
How do we ever get to concepts and judgments and logic when you need something like a derivation of the conceptual out of the involved, absorbed, transparent, basic coping?

340
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,880
And that's what he's going to try to give you now.

341
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,719
And that would, as I wrote here, put logic in its place as a kind of hun.

342
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,520
I mean, in one sense, it would show you that logic has a place.

343
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,879
In another, it would say, but don't get uppity about it, logic.

344
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,960
You can't grasp your own roots, as you'll say later.

345
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,800
Okay, now let's see.

346
00:38:50,800 --> 00:39:02,000
So he's going to show how we transform absorbed dealing into dealing with thematized objects under aspects and then into detached noticing of substances with properties.

347
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,840
That's his project.

348
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:38,799
And it's important to me because it seems to me that nobody of the kind of people that I'm interested in, and the fact that you're here suggests that you are too, people like Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, who want to describe our everyday involved coping sort of experience, they admit, well, Merleau-Ponty admits that he didn't live to admit it, but Merleau-Ponty said, of course, we have to have something like the genealogy of logic, which is just what we're going to get.

349
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,559
A story about how logic can be developed out of our coping experience and out of perception.

350
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,879
And Merleau-Ponty was never able to write it.

351
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,520
There's just a few pages in his, I gather from Sean Kelly, who went to look, that there's nothing interesting.

352
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,480
And Merleau-Ponty had lots of years to do it.

353
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,880
He couldn't do the genealogy of logic.

354
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:14,200
And I don't know anybody else who's trying, except I mentioned Samuel Totis because I published his book when he died, and there's an appendix in which he tries to show how you can get concepts out of the everyday perception.

355
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:22,040
But I don't think anybody's done it very, tried it very well, done it, well, tried it even, and those who tried it haven't got very far.

356
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,520
And Heidegger's gotten further than anybody.

357
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:48,680
And so when you hear this, what we're going to talk about for the rest of the time, here it is, a very rough sketch of a program that ought to be worked out and is really what anybody who believes in the kind of basic involved coping that Heidegger believes in owes an account in detail of how we're able to have science and logic.

358
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,320
And that's what he's giving us here.

359
00:40:51,880 --> 00:41:07,400
And as he says on 196, I say here.

360
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:11,079
So he's going to, at the top, consider assertion.

361
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,359
Well, it's not helpful to begin there, I think.

362
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
So never mind that, I think.

363
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,880
But I'll.

364
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:43,720
Well, what I want is the sentence that he wants, he's going to try to show us at the top of 196 the ways the structure of the as, which is constituted for understanding and interpretation, can be modified.

365
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:50,399
Modified meaning that you will get something else, you will get a formal system instead of an as structure.

366
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,440
And how can that happen and by what steps?

367
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,480
So let me just make sure I've done it, what I want to do.

368
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,199
Yes.

369
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,559
So now we're going to do it.

370
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,680
And he says he's going to do it by starting with assertion on page 195.

371
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:25,599
And that's, and so he says at the very beginning of the section 33: assertion is a derivative mode of interpretation is the name of it.

372
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,640
All interpretation is grounded on understanding.

373
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:31,200
You should be getting used to that by now.

374
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,720
There's basic level coping, and that's understanding.

375
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:40,720
And then there's interpretation, which is thematizing it when there's some kind of problem.

376
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:44,640
And they're, in a sense, grounded in it.

377
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:55,759
So that which has been articulated as such in interpretation and sketched out beforehand in the understanding as something articulable is the meaning.

378
00:42:55,759 --> 00:42:57,279
Well, we just went through all that.

379
00:42:57,279 --> 00:43:00,720
It all seems to be just saying the same thing over and over.

380
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:12,480
Insofar as assertion is grounded on under and judgment is grounded on understanding and presents us with a derivative form in which interpretation has been carried out, it too has a meaning.

381
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:20,480
Yet this meaning cannot be defined as something which occurs in judgment along with the judging itself.

382
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,720
In our present concept, we'll give an explicit analysis of assertion.

383
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:42,199
I take it, I'm never sure about these things, but it looks like what he's saying there is interesting, and it amounts to saying that we're going to talk about, people talk about, in his tradition, assertions and judgments.

384
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:51,079
Kant's got all sorts of talk about judgment, but he wants to talk about the activity of making assertions and making judgments, which would be natural.

385
00:43:51,079 --> 00:44:01,880
I mean, and when he's going to, and he doesn't need these sort of entities, judgments and assertions, as, again, inner mental stuff.

386
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:21,880
He wants to say, well, even making assertions and making judgments is a form of dealing and coping, and we ought to be able to describe that too, and not say that somehow when we are making judgments, that's got to be, we've got to have something called a judgment, which we then are able to perform.

387
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,279
But what is it then to make a judgment and an assertion?

388
00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:27,960
Well, then he's got to tell you a story about that, which he's going to try to do.

389
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,799
And he's just going to go through the phenomena.

390
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,479
He's to understand judging.

391
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,400
We've got to understand asserting.

392
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,879
And asserting is a kind of speech act.

393
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,319
In that way, he's like Searle.

394
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:42,760
It's something people do.

395
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:45,160
And it has three functions.

396
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:59,480
And it turns out that the functions of asserting gets you finally to a point where you can understand properties and substances with their properties.

397
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,480
But you have to get there step by step.

398
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,719
And that's this derivation that I keep saying he's got to give, and he's promised.

399
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,559
So, first, let's look at the three functions.

400
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:08,840
We're still doing all right.

401
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,840
The first function, assertions perform, is on page 196 at the bottom.

402
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,279
The primary significance of assertion is pointing out.

403
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:28,480
In this, we adhere to the primordial meaning of logos as apophansis, that is, letting an entity be seen from itself.

404
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:47,040
Incidentally, he's got an interesting story about logos, which the word that gets taught, when we say man is a rational animal, when we read Aristotle is saying that, it's logos that's being translated as rational.

405
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,520
Or when somebody else says, no, no, basically, man is a speaking animal, then it's logos.

406
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,680
It's all the same word gets translated as speaking.

407
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:03,040
And Heidegger wants to get at an even more basic notion of logos.

408
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,120
Logos, finally, is letting an entity be seen from itself.

409
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,800
It's pointing out.

410
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:21,200
And saying it's rational and speaking, well, it could be rational, and it could be given words, but it could be that in some kind of gesture or some other way you could point it out.

411
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,160
And it would still count as logos.

412
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:34,480
So, in the assertion the hammer is too heavy, what is discovered for sight is not a meaning, but an entity in the way it is ready to hand.

413
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:43,119
And somewhere he says, I just realized I don't know where it is, and it isn't here, that you can make that sort of assertion.

414
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,680
That is, you could point out that the hammer was too heavy without wasting words.

415
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:52,399
I take that to mean you could just put it down and pick up a lighter hammer.

416
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,319
That's already pointing out, or how does it go?

417
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,480
Letting it be seen that the hammer's too heavy.

418
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:11,720
I had a smart student who once wrote a paper all around a similar thing when a doctor says to the nurse or assistant, whoever the assistant is, scalpel.

419
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:20,359
In this whole setup of operating on somebody that they're both very familiar with, he doesn't have to say, I need a scalpel.

420
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,439
He doesn't even have to say, scalpel.

421
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,400
He could just reach, and the nurse is going to give him a scalpel if she's watching what he's doing.

422
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:35,160
That's enough, I think, to count as a pointing out at the very bottom level.

423
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,680
Let's see.

424
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:43,320
And even if, and then, but Heidegger's more interested here in getting rid of another inner thing.

425
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:57,480
A strange claim of his is that we can point, it's easy to see how we can point things out in the vicinity when everybody can see them, like the scalpel story or the hammer story.

426
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,920
But we can even point things out at a distance, not close enough to be seen, he says.

427
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:10,599
And then when we do, let's point out that the war in Iraq is going badly.

428
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:19,800
Now, the usual view is, well, we can't see the war in Iraq, so we must have a representation of it in our mind.

429
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,079
And then we say the war in Iraq is going badly, and you get a representation.

430
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:23,880
I have it in it.

431
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,840
Now you've got a representation of that in your mind.

432
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,599
That's the Sesame Street view, remember, of the flowers.

433
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:37,799
And Heidegger wants to say that doesn't help any, that doesn't add anything, that it just doesn't notice the phenomenon.

434
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,480
The interesting thing is that language can be used to point out stuff that isn't in the vicinity.

435
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:50,159
And when I talk about the war in Iraq, I just am talking about that war, not about a representation of it.

436
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:56,639
And you are in a world in which we both share and in which that war is a part in that world.

437
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:01,120
And you just, you, then it gets pointed out to you.

438
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,840
And that's what he wants to say here.

439
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:13,120
He says the pointing out has in view the entity itself, and not, let us say, a mere representation of it.

440
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,280
Neither something merely represented nor the psychical condition in which the person who makes the assertion represents it.

441
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:25,119
That is, it's not something, you don't need anything in your mind for me to be able to open.

442
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,240
All we need is a shared world.

443
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:40,880
And if we have a shared world, like if the two kids in Sesame Street are both in this thing, this flower, then you can point out the flower without you having a representation and passing it on.

444
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:47,520
And even if you're not in a position where you can see the flower, and it's in another room or something, you can still do it.

445
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,559
So that's his first, that's the asserting, the pointing out story.

446
00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:00,800
Then now comes the beginning of the moves toward predicates, but not right off.

447
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,680
The next thing is predication.

448
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:14,000
But predication, there's something more basic than the kind of predicate that Aristotle thought of asserting a predicate of a subject.

449
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,880
He says, we assert, I'm at the bottom of 196, a predicate of a subject, and the subject is given a definite character by the predicate.

450
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:27,200
In this signification of assertion, that which is put forward is not the predicate, but the hammer itself.

451
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,399
We're back that again.

452
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,040
So we say the hammer is too heavy.

453
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:36,280
One, he's again saying it's the hammer we're talking about, not some representation.

454
00:50:36,279 --> 00:50:42,440
But what's really important here, and he doesn't make it so clear here, but I can make it clear.

455
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:52,599
To say that I've said it before, the hammer is too heavy is a situational story about an aspect of the hammer.

456
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,400
It's very different than a property of the hammer.

457
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,480
And you can tell the difference easily enough.

458
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,919
If you take the hammer and put it in a drawer, it doesn't keep this aspect too heavy.

459
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,320
It's only too heavy for me in this situation with this wood and this nail.

460
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,960
However, a real predicate would be the hammer weighs five pounds.

461
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,399
If you put the hammer in a drawer, it still weighs five pounds.

462
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,680
Predicates are properties of objects.

463
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:24,040
Aspects are something that is a relation between me and objects.

464
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:30,279
And he's going to start with that basic kind of predicate.

465
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,120
And then he can later get to the properties.

466
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:38,599
So he says, on the one hand, what does he, let's see.

467
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,599
So it's too heavy.

468
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,480
Oh, yeah.

469
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:50,440
What he's going to stress here is the positive aspect of saying that something is too heavy.

470
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,599
And that is the very bottom of 196.

471
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:59,399
When I say that, something, my assertion undergoes a narrowing of content.

472
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:02,599
That is, not mental content.

473
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:29,680
But if I say of the hammer it's too heavy, I am telling you not only an aspect, which is what I think is interesting about it, but what he thinks is interesting about it is, I'm calling attention to an aspect of the hammer, namely that it's too heavy and not, say, too light or too noisy or whatever else can happen to hammers, too flimsy and so forth.

474
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,720
When you use a predicate, there is, as he says, a narrowing of content.

475
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,119
And again, don't think of intentional content.

476
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:45,440
It's a narrowing of what it is about the hammer itself that you are pointing out.

477
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,960
And at the top of 197, every predication is what it is, only as a pointing out.

478
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,679
And so assertion means pointing out.

479
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,240
But it's a special kind, and skipping down about six lines in 197.

480
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,839
When we give such a character, our seeing gets restricted.

481
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,800
You see, that's the same as this narrowing of content.

482
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,480
Now you understand what that is.

483
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,440
I mean, we're getting restricted to the weight of the hammer, for instance.

484
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:26,400
Our seeing gets restricted in the first instance, and so that by this explicit restriction of our view, that which is already manifest be made explicitly manifest in its definite character.

485
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:35,280
In giving something a definite character, we must, in the first instance, take a step back when confronted with that which is already manifest, the hammer that is too heavy.

486
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:39,199
That is, you, I take it that means you thematize it.

487
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,599
You have to notice the hammer is too heavy.

488
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,359
You're no longer totally absorbed in it, and then you can see the problem.

489
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:59,280
I guess the picture is you're hammering away and everything's going all right, but then there's some kind of tension, and then finally you step back, you pay attention, and you see, oh, yes, the hammer is too heavy.

490
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:06,359
And that's that, and then we are doing, again, dimming down.

491
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:16,280
So, in setting down the subject, we dim entities down to focus that hammer there so that it dimmed down in its character.

492
00:54:16,279 --> 00:54:18,440
And that's the next move.

493
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:23,000
That's to predicate an aspect of it.

494
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,199
We aren't going to, by the way, don't expect to get to properties right away.

495
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:36,999
There's a kind of detour now through communication, because he's telling you what assertions do, and then he's going to tell you how you get to properties from there.

496
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,240
So, but let's what assertions do is communicate, and then that's he says that on 197.

497
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,559
I'm just making sure I've got everything that I want to talk about.

498
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:50,040
There are lots of things going on at once here.

499
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:02,200
Oh, I did want to, that the top paragraph on 197, the last sentence, setting down the subject, setting down the predicate, and setting down the two together are thoroughly apophantic in the strict sense of the word.

500
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,279
What does the apophantic mean, remember?

501
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:08,680
They are ways of letting something be seen from itself.

502
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:11,720
Namely, you're now seeing the hammer is too heavy.

503
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:16,520
And it's interesting that he's already talking about subjects and predicates here.

504
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,639
That makes me nervous.

505
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:21,079
I would like him to have another word, remember, aspects.

506
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:33,880
It's clear that he's not talking about subjects as self-sufficient things and properties of those things, like the hammer has weight.

507
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,200
He's still talking about the situational kind.

508
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:41,000
But I guess it's just because the tradition calls it.

509
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:43,159
Why is there always subjects with predicates?

510
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:52,320
Because grammatically, when I say this hammer is too heavy, there's the subject, this hammer, is too heavy.

511
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,840
So in that sense, there's already subjects with predicates.

512
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:11,920
But philosophy is going to make a big deal, starting, I guess, with Aristotle, that the really the important subjects are these substances that are self-sufficient and properties that inhere in the substances and are self-sufficient.

513
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,520
And well, they depend on the substances, but like weight, they don't depend on the situation.

514
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,720
But we haven't got there.

515
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:21,519
So just let's do communication and then we'll get there.

516
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,639
We're doing all right still.

517
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,720
197, I'm still looking at things.

518
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:38,559
So the communication lets us share, looking at something, it lets someone see with us what we've pointed out by giving it a definite character.

519
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,000
That's the second sentence in number three.

520
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,760
And going on a little, skipping a little, that which is shared is our being towards what has been pointed out, a being in which we see in common.

521
00:56:49,759 --> 00:56:53,520
Just keep thinking of the Sesame Street thing as what he's objecting to.

522
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,599
What's shared is you're in a shared world and you're pointing at some flower and both of you are seeing the flower.

523
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:08,559
What we must keep in mind is that this being toward is being in the world and that from out of this very world, what has been pointed out gets encountered.

524
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,960
Now, I don't know if I need to read much more of that because he keeps saying it over and over.

525
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,879
I think that's enough.

526
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,440
We can go to 199, where he sums up what he's doing here.

527
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:47,079
And so if we bring together the top paragraph, the middle of 156 in the German, top paragraph of 190, top full paragraph of 199, if we bring together the three significations of assertion, which we have analyzed, and get a unitary view of the full phenomena, then we define assertion as a pointing out which gives something a definite character and which communicates.

528
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,480
That's what he's done.

529
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,640
But what's he going to do with that?

530
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,880
Well, that's what we've got to find out.

531
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:10,280
Again, he's going to tell you, but I have to keep saying it, that assertions only work on the background of shared familiarity and a shared world.

532
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:11,799
So he's a little further down.

533
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:19,400
The pointing out, which assertion does, is performed on the basis of what has already been disclosed in understanding or discovered circumspectively.

534
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:24,760
And that means assertion, now he's going to say, and the tradition doesn't understand that.

535
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:33,159
But that means assertion is not a free-floating kind of behavior, which in his own right might be capable of disclosing entities in general in a primary way.

536
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:41,640
On the contrary, it always maintains itself on the basis of being in the world.

537
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:42,759
And that's fine.

538
00:58:42,759 --> 00:58:45,000
Now he's got that.

539
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:01,640
And it requires a forehaving, it requires a foresight, and we've done all that.

540
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,160
So Kaidig is going to go on now to his job.

541
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:15,680
His job is this kind of derivation, I keep saying, that nobody has, and that he at least is trying to have.

542
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:24,320
And he's asking this important question, which I keep wanting to say, this is the question that analytic and continental philosophers should all be worrying about.

543
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,920
Except none of them are, except I think Sean Kelly is, and he's writing a book about it.

544
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:52,720
But the question Heidegger's asking, and he's at least asking the right question, the middle of 200, the end of the top paragraph, right above the bottom of 157 in German, he's asking by what existential ontological modifications does assertion arise from circumspective interpretation.

545
00:59:52,719 --> 01:00:10,720
And now he's going to, he has to, those existential ontological modifications are the steps that you get when you go from absorbed coping to being able to think of, like a logician, of substance with properties.

546
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:16,640
And the first step is a very sort of mysterious one.

547
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:21,919
Mysterious in the sense that there ought to be a lot to be said about it, but who knows what to say?

548
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,440
Nobody knows what to say.

549
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,480
On 199, but this is some, maybe some of you will know what to say and make a name for yourselves.

550
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,240
He's going to talk now about how the predicate gets loosened from the object.

551
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:44,480
Now that sounds strange, but it's a big, deep, interesting phenomenological question, right below 157 in the margin of 199.

552
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:48,640
Where are we?

553
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:52,199
I lost it.

554
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:53,760
Just a second.

555
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:55,920
199.

556
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:57,840
Right below.

557
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:00,839
I'm looking for where he says the predicate gets loosened from.

558
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,880
Ah, here it is.

559
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,240
Down a little lower.

560
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:05,719
Any assertion requires a foresight.

561
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:15,079
In this, the predicate which we are to assign and make stand out gets loosened, so to speak, from its unexpressed inclusion in the entity itself.

562
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:16,680
That's very interesting.

563
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:18,040
He's trying to.

564
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,599
What do you think that means?

565
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:24,040
Well, you need a little bit of Merleau-Ponty to understand what it means.

566
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:28,200
Merleau-Ponty talks about the woolly redness of the carpet.

567
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:30,119
That's another kind of aspect.

568
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:34,439
I mean, it's got a woolly redness, but you can't separate.

569
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:40,679
Woolly red isn't a color that you can find on a color chart by paint.

570
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:54,520
The woolly redness of the carpet and the shiny redness of fire engines and the apple redness of apples might be the same color of red that if you wanted to paint them and went and bought paint, you'd buy the same color.

571
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:02,359
But the woolliness and the shininess and the juiciness are experienced right in the color.

572
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,160
Marilla-Ponty has a lot to say about it.

573
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:16,280
But what Heidegger is asking himself, without explaining it very well, is how do we get from juicy red and woolly red and shining red to just red?

574
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:26,840
That would be loosening the predicate from the object that is loosening it, so to speak, from its unexpressed inclusion in the entity itself.

575
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,960
And the same with the property heaviness for the hammer that he says down there.

576
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,639
Heaviness belongs to the hammer.

577
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:35,719
The hammer has the well, no, sorry.

578
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:37,720
I jumped ahead.

579
01:02:38,279 --> 01:02:42,440
Let me stick with the property of the let me stick with the move with the color.

580
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,960
So if the interesting question is: well, how do you loosen a predicate?

581
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:54,480
I mean, you can't go out to the paint store every time and buy a color chip and hold it up to the fire engine and the carpet and the apple and stuff.

582
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,999
How do you see them all as examples of the same property, red?

583
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,000
And nobody's got much of a story.

584
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,599
Heidegger's got no story at all.

585
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,040
He just says we do it.

586
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,079
Meryl Ponty was sort of promising a story, but he didn't do it.

587
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,159
I'll just give you two examples, neither one of which are going to be very satisfactory.

588
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:34,160
Totis' story is that we get into a certain detached attitude in which we're not likely to feel the shininess or crunch the juiciness or get wrapped up in the woolliness, but we just take a detached spectatorial attitude and lo and behold, so to speak, the redness comes out of it.

589
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:50,320
It's not very convincing because most of the time we're able to see the color of something, namely, you know, the color of his t-shirt is red, and we can see that without having to bring a color chip and without having to go into a detached state.

590
01:03:50,320 --> 01:04:03,919
And then Sean Kelly's got a view that it's by concentrating more on the redness that you can sort of leave out the material and leave out the shadows and get to the color red.

591
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,319
Maybe that's the right way to go, but who knows?

592
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:12,079
Anyway, there's a whole field in here, and Heidegger's just finessing it, but he at least knows that there's a question.

593
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,320
And it's a nice question.

594
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:25,919
So I don't know.

595
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,319
Why?

596
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,520
Why do you think?

597
01:04:30,400 --> 01:05:09,479
Yeah, now a foresight is the what now the way that we it's got to do with circumspection it's got to do with but it's got to do with what pulling out one or another of I'm going to get back we've got forehaving that's the familiarity we've got foresight that's taking up some affordance or other now why would that do it I don't know why would that I'm I I mean I'm inclined to think that Heidegger doesn't know what he's talking about, but that's a bad idea, bad thought to have.

598
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,320
I mean, Heidegger usually knows more than we do about what he's talking about.

599
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:18,040
But let's read it and see if we can get any clue.

600
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:23,240
So we're going to look, we give it a definite character.

601
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:27,159
I'm right down two-thirds on page 199.

602
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:29,639
Thus, any assertion requires a foresight.

603
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:38,520
In this, the predicate, which we have assigned and make stand out, gets loosened, so to speak, from its unexpressed inclusion in the entity.

604
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,760
And here, the predicate with the hammer ought to be too heavy.

605
01:05:42,759 --> 01:05:51,559
And now we ought to somehow, we know that we narrow our, we pay attention to the too heavy.

606
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:53,159
We narrow our interest in the hammer.

607
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:55,800
We don't care if it's too noisy and so forth.

608
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,240
But that would still be situational too heavy.

609
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:01,320
So how are we going to get out of that?

610
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:07,800
To any assertion as a communication which gives something a definite character, there belongs an articulation of what is pointed out.

611
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,079
And this articulation is in accordance with significations.

612
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:14,199
Such an assertion will operate with a definite way of conceiving.

613
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:15,679
The hammer is heavy.

614
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:18,159
As soon as you get to heavy, you got to the property.

615
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:19,760
Heaviness belongs to the hammer.

616
01:06:15,399 --> 01:06:21,679
The hammer has the property of heaviness.

617
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:27,519
When an assertion is made, some foreconception is implied, and it remains in the room because of the language.

618
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:35,599
Like any interpretation, assertion has foresight, forehaving, foresight, and foreconception.

619
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,559
At the end, he's got all three there.

620
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,359
Why did he pick out foresight on the way?

621
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:42,399
Good question, Dave.

622
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,079
I have no idea what the answer is.

623
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:44,880
Anyone know?

624
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,679
Yeah.

625
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:52,159
Yeah, maybe I don't have to be experienced.

626
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,960
I guess that's right.

627
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:10,960
If foresight is what tells you to pick out one affordance from the whole web of affordances, which is familiarity, and that's what it seemed to mean, at least that's my guess.

628
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:20,639
So then it's the same kind of operation that enables you to pick out some aspect of the hammer from all the others, like being too heavy.

629
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,119
But then, maybe that's all it's supposed to do.

630
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,199
Wouldn't that be interesting?

631
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:36,079
If it was not heaviness, but too heavy, I could understand how foresight picks it out.

632
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,439
See, I think you need another move to get to heaviness.

633
01:07:39,439 --> 01:07:43,119
I'm going to just, I mean, correcting Heidegger is not a good enterprise.

634
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:43,679
Yeah.

635
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:47,040
What does it?

636
01:07:49,439 --> 01:07:50,319
Yes.

637
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,359
Hmm.

638
01:07:55,479 --> 01:07:56,559
Do you think so?

639
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:02,359
I mean, just transparent hammering is going on, as opposed to being given the character too heavy.

640
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:04,839
Yeah.

641
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:07,880
Okay, yes.

642
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:09,159
Indefinite.

643
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:21,880
And then you focus in on the two on the on, well, the problem still is there, and I don't know how to deal with it, but are you focusing in on the too heavy, or are you already focusing in on heaviness, which the hammer has even in a drawer?

644
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,199
That's right.

645
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:38,199
Okay, so the first move is to focus on the too heavy by the foresight, but then my correcting of the bottom of 199, I'm afraid, is right.

646
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:40,759
And I don't like it, it makes me nervous to correct Heidegger.

647
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:46,920
He seems to say that what you do with your foresight is go right to the heaviness belongs to the hammer.

648
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,759
It has the property heaviness.

649
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,799
I don't like that.

650
01:08:49,800 --> 01:09:00,519
I wish he would say, first you pick out the too heavy, and then you need another move, which he does give you on the next page, where you go to the property heaviness.

651
01:09:00,519 --> 01:09:03,399
So let's go there.

652
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:15,079
I mean, I'd like to say what she is saying and he is saying, that having picked out the too heavy, we're now ready to make a move toward the property heaviness.

653
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:17,079
Let's see what we can do there.

654
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,759
To what extent, at the top of 200, to what extent does it become a derivative mode of interpretation?

655
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,519
What has been modified in it?

656
01:09:24,519 --> 01:09:32,519
We can point out the modification if we stick to a limiting case of assertion, which functions in logic as normal cases.

657
01:09:32,519 --> 01:09:38,759
Now, that limiting case of assertion is de-worlding, de-situating, I'm sure.

658
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:40,359
So we'll find out.

659
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:45,880
So, which functions in logic as a normal case, and, as an examples, simplest assertion phenomena.

660
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:53,679
Prior to all analysis, logic is already understood and takes as its theme the categorical statement: the hammer is heavy.

661
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:03,040
Now, there's the right place to bring in the hammer and say, look, logic just helps itself to the de-situated claim that the hammer is heavy.

662
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:03,760
But let's go on.

663
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:11,199
The unexplained presupposition is that the meaning of this sentence is to be taken, this thing, a hammer, has the property heaviness.

664
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:18,559
Well, how does that differ from the bottom of 199, where it looked like you already had got the quote-quote property?

665
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,719
The hammer has the property of heaviness.

666
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,960
I think it's just confused.

667
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,199
You see what I'm worrying about?

668
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,119
I mean, he seems to go through it twice.

669
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:32,479
And the foresight ought to get him to the too heavy at the bottom of 199.

670
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:40,479
He needs a whole nother move, he says, which is characteristic of logic to get to the thing, a hammer has the property heaviness.

671
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:44,559
If anybody can help, you and then you will, I'm delighted.

672
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,199
Yeah.

673
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:04,479
Well, it is a deficient mode, but I don't know if that helps because we're trying to...

674
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:06,800
There are two deficient modes, it seems to me.

675
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:18,079
One is you narrow down from just being absorbed in the hammering to paying attention to one aspect, literally aspect, that it's too heavy.

676
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:29,759
And then there's another move of again leaving something out where you leave out the situation and leave out the too heavy and get to the property heaviness.

677
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,840
And that's what he says logicians do.

678
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:39,719
I mean, they don't the heaviness is not a relational property between the hammer and me, but too heavy was.

679
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,239
Let's hear what you have to say.

680
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:41,880
Yeah.

681
01:11:48,600 --> 01:12:05,639
What I'm asking is, having done a nice job with foresight getting us the aspect, I hope, of too heavy at the bottom of 199, which is how I'd like to read it, he then says, aha, but we can go to another even more derivative mode of interpretation, it looks like.

682
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:16,359
We get to this limiting case of assertions, which I take to mean you take them out of the context, you treat them just as a statement, and then you get the hammer is heavy.

683
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:20,119
This thing, a hammer, has the property heaviness.

684
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:21,479
That's fine.

685
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:28,679
And I don't care whether you get there by foresight or what.

686
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:45,399
He doesn't tell us, but it seems to me he ought to tell us what kind of attitude or mode of dealing gets us from the too heavy to the heavy.

687
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,599
Yeah.

688
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:07,880
Pick it up from a certain amount of force and punch to another and some things might have available with you, but that thing has a certain heaviness.

689
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,040
And when you're getting dressed in one, I think you're not think about it.

690
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,359
Let me see here.

691
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:19,040
Oh, but it's in the balance.

692
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,920
It wasn't in your foresight.

693
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,960
I like that.

694
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,319
And let me just repeat it.

695
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,920
It's out of desperation, I admit.

696
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:41,839
But I think if you have to make sense of this passage at the bottom of 199, you've got to think that somehow, I don't know how you're going to do this.

697
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:50,000
The property of heaviness is already somehow in your experience of the hammering.

698
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,359
And you and what?

699
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,920
Your foresight brings it out?

700
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,359
I'm still stumped.

701
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:01,599
I mean, you still have the problem.

702
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,319
We still have the problem.

703
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:04,319
Are you going to help us out of this problem?

704
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,239
Well, doesn't he say that?

705
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,000
Heaviness at the 199 bottom.

706
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:13,279
Heaviness belongs to the hammer.

707
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:14,559
The hammer has the property.

708
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,679
I'm just taking his word there of heaviness.

709
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:22,479
Both property and heaviness are desituated stuff.

710
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:28,559
That's the assertion, doing it with the help of the foresight.

711
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:42,159
But then what more is added when we go to a derivative mode of interpretation at the top of 200, with a limiting case, which finally seems to get us the thing has the property heaviness.

712
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,040
Where are you now?

713
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,439
158 already.

714
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:54,559
Well, wait, what do you say?

715
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,439
Again.

716
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:56,880
I see.

717
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,799
Wait, 158 in the margin.

718
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,479
Okay, the entity, let's try that.

719
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:03,239
Then I'll, whoever, somebody had a hand back there.

720
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,119
Wait, wait, cursor.

721
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:09,960
The entity which is held in our forehaving, for instance, the hammer, is approximately ready to hand as equipment.

722
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:15,639
If this entity becomes the object of an assertion, then as soon as we begin this assertion, there is a changeover.

723
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:19,799
Well, the changeover is crucial, all right?

724
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:26,920
But now there's something ready to hand turns into something about which the assertion is made.

725
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:31,239
Our forehaving is aimed at something present at hand and what is ready to hand.

726
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:38,040
Now, what you want to say is way back at the bottom of 199, that's already what he's talking about.

727
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,319
Is that right?

728
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:51,719
Because there's already a change, the changeover must have already taken place because the changeover is what gets us.

729
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,680
Well, let's go in a minute.

730
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:56,359
Our foresight aimed at something present at hand and what ready to hand.

731
01:15:56,359 --> 01:16:01,479
That's, I think, well, let me sort of blurt out.

732
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:19,479
I think what should happen is one stage would get us to the aspect of it, too heavy, and then a changeover, a modification, a desituating move, would get us to where logic is, and then you get.

733
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:22,040
So let me try this word: the too heavy comes back in a minute.

734
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:23,960
About ten lines.

735
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,279
I mean, in concern for circumspection, there are no such assertions at first.

736
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:32,839
But such circumspection has, of course, its specific ways of interpreting.

737
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:38,839
And these, as compared with the theoretical judgment just mentioned, may take the form the hammer is too heavy.

738
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,840
And rather, just too heavy.

739
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:44,359
Oh, there it is, where you do something without wasting words.

740
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:49,599
What's the wrong order?

741
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,559
I mean, why?

742
01:16:52,159 --> 01:17:03,599
It's as if that's the passage that I think ought to come before the passage in which you then do a changeover and you get to the plain object and so forth.

743
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:09,359
But what's happening in prematurely, sort of at the bottom of 199?

744
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,920
How come the too heavy is now here?

745
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,079
You'd expect the too heavy to be down there.

746
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:15,839
Okay, Curtis, can you help us?

747
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:31,759
Well, I think there's a confusion of sorts, which I will just sort out in a hurry because time is up.

748
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,759
I mean, there's a phenomenological question and a textual question.

749
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:51,199
The phenomenological story, I'll just, so you won't get lost, is that there's transparent coping, and then you narrow that and focus on the too heavy, then you produce a changeover, you step out of the situation, and you look at an object which has the property heaviness.

750
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:56,960
Now, that seems okay, and that all seems to be something you can do maybe with foresight.

751
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,159
I don't know.

752
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:02,399
But then comes the further question: why is he telling the story in such a funny order?

753
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:11,840
Where first he went at the bottom of 199, he talks about the heaviness, and then there, then he gets to the too heavy, then he gets back to the heaviness.

754
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,159
I don't understand the development there.

755
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:15,679
Okay, go on.

756
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,359
Yeah.

757
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,359
Regarding foresight, forehaving, his role in his window, this goal is breakdown.

758
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:34,040
We talked about the forehaving page 191 and find it right there, and seeing it a world we already have.

759
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:35,000
That's right.

760
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,639
Then we just.

761
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:40,920
Yes, right.

762
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,719
Yes.

763
01:18:48,279 --> 01:18:48,840
That's right.

764
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:51,159
It's deworlded.

765
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,519
That's good.

766
01:19:04,359 --> 01:19:05,479
I think that's good.

767
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,239
So there's a change in your.

768
01:19:07,399 --> 01:19:09,639
Where's the change in your forehaving?

769
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:14,840
Okay.

770
01:19:15,159 --> 01:19:15,800
Yes.

771
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,239
Well, that's interesting.

772
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:17,719
Okay.

773
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:21,239
That's the right phenomenological story to tell.

774
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:22,760
That's what you must be trying to tell.

775
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,960
Boy, time is up.

776
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,920
I don't know what to do.

777
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:28,679
Just quick, Dave, and quick you.

778
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:34,199
Let's stop.

779
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:38,040
And slow down and do it again.

780
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:39,880
Okay, maybe textually that.

781
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,000
Try reading it that way.

782
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,679
It runs over fast and slows down.

783
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,960
Is that what you?

784
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:54,040
Okay, so that would make the text work, and thanks to Curtis, we would get the phenomena, and then everybody would go home happy.

785
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:54,759
Okay.
