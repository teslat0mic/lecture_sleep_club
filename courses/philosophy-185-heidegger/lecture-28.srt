1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,001
So let's start.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,160
To begin with, I want to go back and try to say more clearly what's going on with the truth chapter, though I find it very, very subtle and minimal and hard to get a grip on.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,800
This may not be right either, but it's at least better.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,800
So I think to begin with, we've got to understand what Heidegger's up to.

5
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:29,200
In the truth chapter, he's got three different jobs.

6
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:33,201
I guess really four different jobs, but I'm only going to talk about three of them.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,840
I'll tell you which one the fourth is and why.

8
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:37,440
I'm not going to talk about it.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,001
But the three are, he wants to reject the correspondence theory of truth, roughly say that it's incoherent and useless.

10
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:52,561
And then, this is the subtle part, tries to recover the phenomenon behind the traditional view.

11
00:00:52,561 --> 00:01:00,320
Something that is really going on, that the traditional view got wrong, but which you've got to pay attention to and try to get right.

12
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:03,440
That's what we're going to talk about a lot of the time.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,361
And then derive, and then he owes an explanation, as usual when you do this sort of thing.

14
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:16,440
Well, how come for 2,000 years a lot of very smart people believed the correspondence theory of truth?

15
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:35,160
What's going on there that makes that seem so obviously the right way to think about things, that there's something subjective or mental or ideal whereby minds or propositions have content and correspond to objects.

16
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,121
That seems a very plausible view.

17
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:44,281
So he has to tell us why it seems plausible and wrong and why it's wrong.

18
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:56,120
I mean, we've already seen that it's hopeless for the incoherent, but now he wants to also show the particular mistake that leads to this incoherent view.

19
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:59,240
Okay, so starting with one.

20
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:08,281
We make an assertion that an object, this is just the sort of facts of the case.

21
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:15,320
We make assertions like the lectern is on the table and or the lectern is brown.

22
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,600
Let's stick to that one.

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,521
That's the sort of traditional one.

24
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:22,120
This object has this property.

25
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:26,841
And that seems all right, and we can get it right or wrong.

26
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:35,641
If I say this object is blue, that assertion isn't going to do the right thing, isn't going to get to the object at all.

27
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,240
So we've got to understand that we can get it wrong.

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:55,721
And now, and the wrong conclusion to draw from these simple facts is that, again, there must be some content in the subject that corresponds or fails to correspond to the property of the object, namely that in this case, that it's brown.

29
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:11,281
And that view turns out to be incoherent in the sense that we can't really understand what it is for something ideal or mental.

30
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:16,480
I keep saying ideal or mental because there are two different kinds of representations that could correspond.

31
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:24,401
One could be something you have in your mind, intentional content, as Searle would call it, and lots of people call it.

32
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:33,680
It's something, or that's how your assertion, how you're related to an object, so that you make this assertion about it.

33
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:42,240
I have a representation of this lectern, and I have a representation of the lectern that's brown, and that's my mental content.

34
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,081
And then I assert it of the object.

35
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,921
But it also could be ideal.

36
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,601
Heidegger doesn't talk much about that.

37
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,761
Husserl talks a lot about that.

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:59,680
So propositions like the lectern is brown seem to correspond to the object, even if nobody's saying them or entertaining, making assertions like that.

39
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:11,281
And then we're told, well, the propositions have propositional content, which is some kind of ideal entity that is what makes them, relates them to the object.

40
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:13,440
And Heidegger's got both in mind.

41
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:29,841
But the one he's really after, because it's being in time, he's writing, and because he doesn't want to fight with Husserl at this point in his career, is the subject kind, the intentional content, which is the representation in my mind of the object.

42
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:34,320
And that's the view he really wants to criticize.

43
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:37,281
But now, I'll get back to it.

44
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:43,281
I'm going to go over each of these three points in more detail, but I'm going over them just roughly now.

45
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:50,761
He wants to return to the phenomenon of agreement or correspondence and in some way get it right.

46
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,360
I've said that already.

47
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:55,560
I'm going to say the things, sort of what I'm saying three times.

48
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,000
I said it very generally in the introduction a minute ago.

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,040
I want to run through each of the three quickly, and then I want to run through each of the three in more detail.

50
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,841
But I'm just going over them, or am I?

51
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,201
No, I'm going to stick with this one.

52
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:10,761
Sorry.

53
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:18,360
So I'm going to do the first one first, and that is, now I should be on about 260.

54
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,081
I don't know.

55
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,880
I seem to have lost a piece, but that's all right.

56
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,841
We can find it.

57
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:34,120
I mean, I'm just looking for the place where he says we don't have any idea what this notion of agreement or correspondence could be.

58
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:44,600
How does something ideal or mental get to be corresponding to or agreeing with or in some way even like an object?

59
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:58,360
I mean, whatever it is I've got in my mind, or whatever ideal entity propositions have as their content, it doesn't seem to have anything to do with brown lecterns on the table in such a way that you could just say, compare them.

60
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,281
Look, how similar they are.

61
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:02,281
They're not similar at all.

62
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:05,480
That's this first kind of objection.

63
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:06,761
What way?

64
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:07,560
Yeah.

65
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:09,881
Yes.

66
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,961
Okay, right, good.

67
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:26,600
In clarifying the truth relation, we should notice also what a peculiar peculiar to the terms of this relation with regard to what do intellectus, the mind, and race, things, agree?

68
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,160
In their kind of being, in their essential content, do they give us anything at all with regard to which they can agree?

69
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,841
If it's impossible for intellectus and race to be equal because they are not of the same species, are they perhaps similar?

70
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:42,160
And then he decides they're not even similar.

71
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,721
So you have to go back and try to figure out some other way of talking about this.

72
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:57,121
At the end of the paragraph, from these questions, it becomes plain that to clarify the structure of truth is not enough to presuppose this relational totality.

73
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,880
We've got to go back and inquire into the context of being that provides a support of this totality.

74
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,721
That is, we've got to go back and find out something about the phenomenon.

75
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:07,760
I want to write in here.

76
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,800
I don't know why I lost 258.

77
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,920
Okay.

78
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,800
And so then that's, and when he's that's now I connect up with what I was writing and thinking about this morning.

79
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:31,680
Namely, the question which keeps coming up, particularly when I talk to some of the students in office hours about this, is, well, does he believe in the notion of agreement and correspondence at all?

80
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,480
Well, in a certain way, no, because he thinks that you can't make any sense of it.

81
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,761
But he does think that there's some phenomenon that's being gotten, and that he wants to get at that phenomenon.

82
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:56,481
And really, I suppose, you could call it agreement, except that agreement has now been sort of taken over by these agreements of these fictitious entities that don't agree with each other.

83
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:04,721
He's going to have to find a phenomenon of agreement, which is not the agreement of something mental with something objective.

84
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:07,441
But this is what he's saying, I think, on 260.

85
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:11,681
So look at the middle of the top paragraph.

86
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:21,081
We must, at the same time try to bring into view a phenomenon which is characteristic of knowledge, the phenomenon of truth.

87
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:24,201
What does truth become phenomenal?

88
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:29,081
When does truth become phenomenally explicit in knowledge itself?

89
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:33,481
It does so when such knowing demonstrates itself as true.

90
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,161
By demonstrating itself, it is assured of its truth.

91
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:43,480
Thus, in the phenomenal context of demonstration, the relationship of agreement must become visible.

92
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,641
It's that last little piece of the quote that I'm interested in.

93
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,881
There is a phenomenon of agreement.

94
00:08:49,880 --> 00:09:02,121
And we've got to get on that phenomenon before we can spell out how to think about truth and how to say what's right about the traditional view of agreement.

95
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,520
Yeah.

96
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,760
Okay, that's a tough one.

97
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,441
Boy, is that a tough one?

98
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,961
I don't know.

99
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:16,760
If he does, they would be obviously breakdown states.

100
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:27,161
He doesn't think that in our normal talking, in our normal coping, in the flow of the way we are in the world, mental states play any role at all.

101
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,921
I'm clear about that.

102
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:37,001
But I think he does think that when there's a kind of breakdown, we do attribute it to mental states.

103
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:56,041
We say something like, well, he believed such and such, or that when he mentions in moods that when somebody's in a weird mood, then you have to attribute some inner mood to them because they're out of tune with the shared mood that everybody else is in.

104
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,321
And so I think he does believe that there is mental content.

105
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:12,241
And I think he thinks that it's just not the basic under stuff out of which you understand knowledge and you understand action.

106
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:21,361
Searle thinks that intentional content in perception and action is the way to understand our relation to the world and our ability to act.

107
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,281
Heidegger certainly thinks no.

108
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,081
But then, I don't know if anybody here agrees or disagrees with me.

109
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,401
It seems to me he needs a notion of mental content.

110
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,640
I don't see how he can get rid of it, and I don't see why he should get rid of it, as long as he understands where it fits in.

111
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:36,961
Yeah.

112
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:48,641
Oh.

113
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,761
You're a perfect straight person for this.

114
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,961
Yes, that's where that's level two.

115
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,161
In Heidegger's jargon, that's not wrong.

116
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,841
That comes in too late.

117
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,441
It's true that we've got lots of beliefs, and it's sometimes important to find out what we believe and what other people believe.

118
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:13,360
It's true, what was the second thing you said?

119
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,561
I just lost it.

120
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:17,201
You said beliefs and something else.

121
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,360
Okay, and we make choices and decisions, and all that is absolutely right.

122
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:49,240
But you should be getting used to the idea now that that's all on the background of familiarity and transparent, skillful coping, pressing into possibilities, which are on the basis, to talk Heidegger talking, that's on the basis of that basic way in which we are the world existingly, just absorbed in it.

123
00:11:49,561 --> 00:12:00,681
Like Hassart says in one place I just saw, like ink in a blotter, which is a nice metaphor, when we're like that, then we're not having beliefs about anything.

124
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:03,721
We're just doing it, and we're not making choices about anything.

125
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:07,081
We're just responding to whatever is pulling us at the moment.

126
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,041
So, I'm glad you asked.

127
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:21,561
I mean, that's the important phenomenological intuition to keep in mind, is always that the tradition, of which Sterl is a perfect example, has got something right.

128
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:31,880
It's just that they think that they've got the basic thing, and what they've got is a certain kind of interesting, important, and not to be belittled.

129
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,001
And that's why I say breakdown phenomenon isn't quite the right word.

130
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,681
It's a disturbance of the flow phenomenon.

131
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,360
That's what they've got.

132
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,760
Yeah.

133
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:55,721
Whether you see something like internal monologue, it encompasses all of the coping.

134
00:12:57,801 --> 00:13:01,160
Is there an internal monologue accompanying all of our coping?

135
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:01,961
Not my coping.

136
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,121
Usually I find out only later what I've done.

137
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:22,761
Oh, well, I do think that a lot of the time we're thinking about stuff, where we're heading and what's going to happen in class and what just happened in class.

138
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,681
Heidegger doesn't have to deny that.

139
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:29,401
He just has to say that that plays no essential role in our perceiving and acting.

140
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,041
It's just accompaniment.

141
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:38,961
You could shut it up if you're a good Buddhist, I think, or and could go into a kind of mindless state, and you'd be better off if you could.

142
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:53,361
But there is this sort of yakking inner track, and so I think Heidegger's going to say, Yeah, there is this kind of constant talk going on, so much the worse for us all, but it isn't playing any important role.

143
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,240
I think it'd be crazy to deny it.

144
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,721
No, it's just well, sort of not.

145
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:06,321
It's sort of this con this thought and then that thought and all kinds of sort of that's the internal monologue.

146
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:20,321
If you once you think that that's what's basic, is the influx like Kant, the sort of stream of experience and inner sense, then you're in the old traditional view in whatever version you happen to have it.

147
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,881
You look like you want to say something else.

148
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,921
Oh, okay.

149
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:27,361
Yeah, yes, go ahead.

150
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,240
With what?

151
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,681
When we're reading.

152
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:34,961
Where is that?

153
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,561
That's interesting.

154
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:42,001
We're thinking, and what is we what are we doing when we're thinking?

155
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,841
Well, look at the phenomenon.

156
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:52,001
We are perceiving the book, and through that, the ideas.

157
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:57,920
And I don't know if Heidegger has anything to say about it.

158
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:19,001
The important thing I think to say about it, if you're Heidegger, is it's derivative, and you could do an interesting phenomenological study of it, but it would all again be on the basis of the general familiarity of the books and of what's in the book and the skill for reading the book, all of which has to be in place.

159
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,921
But I think, I mean, maybe I'm missing something, but I don't know any place where Heidegger talks about that kind of thinking.

160
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,760
He has his own notion of thinking.

161
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,360
He thinks thinking is very important.

162
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,041
It's something he's doing.

163
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:40,441
But before he writes the book, I mean, it's there, there are thinkers, and they try to understand the human condition and what's going on in the world and find language for expressing it.

164
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,361
He's got a story about that.

165
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,521
He's also got a story, which is interestingly more down to earth.

166
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:54,841
That when he tells his class at one point in one of the lectures, think about the bridge in Heidelberg.

167
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:58,921
And then he says, And where, and what have you got in your mind?

168
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:02,681
Some representation of the bridge in Heidelberg that you're consulting?

169
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:07,001
No, your mind is just directly at the bridge in Heidelberg.

170
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:20,360
And he says, Of course, if it's snowing on the bridge in Heidelberg, it isn't snowing here in the classroom, but then you're, but you have your mind directed toward the bridge in Heidelberg, and in this case, that it's being snowed on.

171
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,441
And he thinks, and I think that's right.

172
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:26,840
I mean, he just says he's just, again, sticking to the phenomena and not, what does he say?

173
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:37,800
And you're slipping in some representation that's supposed to help, but I think he would say doesn't really help to say, aha, you get to the bridge in Heidelberg by the representation of the bridge you have in your mind.

174
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,480
It doesn't do any good to say that.

175
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:47,160
You might as well just stick to the phenomena and say we have the capacity to think about things, whether they're in our immediate vicinity or not.

176
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:47,640
Yeah.

177
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,841
No, that's right.

178
00:16:54,361 --> 00:17:01,841
You mean, well, yes, the book sort of is transparent for you.

179
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Certainly, what you could completely not notice what language it was in.

180
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:12,801
That happens to bilingual people like my kids would never know whether they were reading their comic books in French or English.

181
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:14,800
That is transparent.

182
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,601
And so much of that gets out of the way.

183
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:27,280
But notice, remember, I told you the story where people try to get it into your inner, the Augustine story, I'm sure I told you about St.

184
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:28,560
Jerome.

185
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:42,641
And the wrong analysis of reading is what you're saying, is that some meaning is coming from the book, that's true, and somehow going into your interior private meaning store.

186
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:57,840
Of course, when somebody's reading to themselves and they're reading the book and people are all sitting around watching this amazing phenomenon, it is true that they're getting the meaning transparently out of the book and it's going directly into their mind.

187
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,240
But that isn't anything inner.

188
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,161
It's just a meaning that they contemplate when they do it.

189
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:05,361
I can't say more about that.

190
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,281
And I can't even say I recommend you try to write a paper topic on it.

191
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,840
I think it's just something that Heidegger hasn't got anything to say about.

192
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,480
And all I can do is do what I just did, try to tell you why he doesn't have anything to say about it.

193
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Because he would say it's so derivative.

194
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:39,120
There's so much to say about familiarity, about coping, about perceiving, about which he doesn't have very much to say, and so forth, that and until you get that straightened out, which has been messed up for 2,000 years, don't worry about these other questions.

195
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,721
But now people will.

196
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:50,360
And Alva Noe, one of my colleagues, who's a cognitive science kind of person and an analyst, oh, he's interested in Heidegger and so forth.

197
00:18:50,361 --> 00:19:05,400
But anyway, Alva's very interested now in the way our mind could be at a bridge in Heidelberg, and that the cognitive science people with their notion that, well, perception is direct, but mental stuff requires representation.

198
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:06,681
Now they're going to get the net.

199
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:09,080
That's already, the first move is already made.

200
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:18,280
Lots of interest in idolatic philosophy and how perception turns out to be direct, meaning not having any inner representations involved.

201
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,921
Next move is going to be, Alva's always on the forefront, is going to be how thinking is direct, and maybe we'll learn something from them.

202
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:31,080
Let Heidegger do the basic work and let them do the next, always the coming in too late work.

203
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,240
Okay, now, where am I?

204
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,520
Those are good questions.

205
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,121
Now I don't know where you are, though.

206
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:46,201
Oh, okay, let's go back to the phenomenon of agreement, that important sentence to me, because I think we're supposed to find the phenomenon of agreement.

207
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,520
It must be, I've got to read it over.

208
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,320
Thus, the phenomenal context of demonstration, the relationship of agreement, must become visible.

209
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:06,681
So now we're going to get a phenomenological story about some kind of agreement, but it's a kind of agreement that isn't going to involve any mental content, any mental representation.

210
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,760
And how is that going to work?

211
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:18,441
Well, and I'm not sure I get this right yet, it's tricky to preserve the phenomenon of agreement and not bring in any of these strange intermediate entities.

212
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:31,201
Well, I think Heidegger wants to say the assertion I make that the lectern is brown, is true if it points out the object as being a certain way, it points out the how of the object.

213
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:37,040
And the object shows itself to be the way the assertion points it out as being.

214
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,721
I mean, that's the minimal kind of agreement as far as I can see.

215
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:44,480
I hope I haven't smuggled in content every time I try to say it.

216
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,160
I get accused of it.

217
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:51,360
But I'll read it again, and then you all can think about whether it makes sense.

218
00:20:51,361 --> 00:21:09,201
So I think he thinks, and I'll read you quotes, that what happens in a true assertion is that it points out the object as being a certain way, and what's left of the agreement part is, and the object shows itself to be the way the assertion points it out as being.

219
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,121
That's got to be pretty empty.

220
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,441
I'm trying to make it as empty as possible.

221
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:22,240
The whole game is not to bring in any strange entities and yet to preserve some kind of phenomenon of what it is to make a true assertion.

222
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,360
Okay, now I'll read you places where we do that.

223
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:30,320
I'm still trying to review, but I always get stuck in my reviews, so I've got to be careful here.

224
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Okay, on page 261, I want to read about halfway down in the top big chunk, which is a paragraph that began way back on 260.

225
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,480
I want to read about 10 lines down on 261.

226
00:21:49,121 --> 00:22:01,441
The entity itself, which one has in mind, shows itself, and that's a bad translation, as I read in one of the commentaries.

227
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:06,560
All that says in German is the entity which is meant.

228
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:11,600
You don't want to bring in one has in mind there and sort of blow the whole game.

229
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,520
Gemeint, it's in German.

230
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,681
The entity meant shows itself just as it is in itself.

231
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:30,280
That is to say, it shows that it, in itself-sameness, is, just as it gets pointed out in the assertion as being, just as it gets uncovered as being.

232
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,601
I take that to be just the same thing I'm trying to say.

233
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:38,120
The object shows itself as being the way the assertion points it out as being.

234
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:44,360
And now I want to read more of that kind of talk, just skipping a few lines.

235
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:49,480
What is to be demonstrated is solely the being uncovering of the entity itself.

236
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,160
That entity in the how of its uncoveredness.

237
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,801
The how of its uncoveredness is it's uncovered as a brown lectern, presumably.

238
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:02,760
And that gets shown when it's pointed out.

239
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:14,921
This uncoveredness is confirmed when that which is put forward in the assertion, namely the entity itself, the brown lectern, shows itself as that very same thing.

240
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:17,721
That's the minimalist correspondence again.

241
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:24,840
The lectern that I'm talking about shows itself as the lectern I'm talking about.

242
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,921
Something like that is the minimal truth.

243
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,120
Now skipping to the bottom, the crucial sentences are all there.

244
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,520
I read them once already, but I've got to read them again.

245
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,921
To say that an assertion is true signifies that it uncovers the entity as it is in itself.

246
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:45,961
Such an assertion asserts, points out, lets the entity be seen.

247
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:53,000
By the way, later he's going to say, if it's a really important true assertion, you have to sort of make a big effort to let the entity be seen.

248
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,641
But that's coming up at the end of the chapter.

249
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:59,160
Just now, let's the entity be seen.

250
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:10,561
Yeah, Pathansis, in its uncoveredness, the being true of the assertion must be understood as being uncovering.

251
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:17,120
It's true when it uncovers the entity, as the entity is in itself.

252
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:21,521
Thus, truth has by no means the structure of an agreement between.

253
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,480
Now, he's not repudiating agreement, but he's repudiating the correspondence theory.

254
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:39,120
It has not the structure of an agreement between a knowing, that's the subject, and the object, in the sense of a likening of one entity, the subject, to another, the object.

255
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:40,961
That's the wrong kind of agreement.

256
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:45,201
You've got to get this much more minimal kind of agreement to stick to the phenomenon.

257
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:51,681
Okay, now, I've done that part of what I want to do.

258
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:54,800
262 is the next piece of it.

259
00:24:57,361 --> 00:25:07,441
Yeah, at the very bottom, I'm still making my case that what he's trying to do is take over the agreement story and make it work.

260
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:14,800
Because he says, in proposing our definition of truth, which we've just been having, we have not shaken off the tradition.

261
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,120
We've appropriated it primordially.

262
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:20,721
You're not supposed to say, look, Heidegger's repudiated the correspondence theory.

263
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,081
He's repudiated agreement.

264
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:24,240
That's what the secondary sources all say.

265
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,121
Well, that's true.

266
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:28,000
He's certainly repudiated the correspondence theory.

267
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,880
And he's repudiated a certain kind of account of agreement, the one that he's shaken off here.

268
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:47,000
But he's got his own version of a phenomenon of indicating something in a way that something shows up the way you indicated it is being.

269
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,240
He keeps that, I think.

270
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:52,361
And that's a kind of minimalist view of truth.

271
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:56,520
I just wanted to relate you to other courses you might have had.

272
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:09,480
You might have come across this attempt to be totally deflationary about truth and not bring in any fancy entities like representations in the subject.

273
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,800
And you get it in Wittgenstein, in Rorty, and in Davidson.

274
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:17,800
How many have read one of those, any one of those three in other courses?

275
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,320
How many read N of them on truth in any other course?

276
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,441
Not very many.

277
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:28,201
Oh, well, anyway, if you had, you could see interesting connections to this.

278
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,560
But now, if you ask, but how in the world does the assertion do that?

279
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:41,640
Indicate the object in such a way that if it's a true assertion, it indicates the object as it is in itself.

280
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,681
And the answer is, Dasein does it.

281
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,201
Well, again, and the answer shouldn't be, aha, there's something in the mind, this wonderful thing.

282
00:26:50,201 --> 00:27:01,801
Again, this, Husserl called it Noima, intentional content, whatever, that, you know, in a marvelous way, just sort of directs their mind toward the objects.

283
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,921
Husserl said it was Wunderbar that it could do that.

284
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:15,320
And the interesting thing, if you're a Heideggerian, you think in Husserl, well, that just means you don't have the slightest clue how it does it, so why do you bring it in at all and say that it's marvelous that it does it?

285
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:18,361
But then you want to know, well, how do we do it?

286
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:21,881
Well, the answer from Heidegger is, of course, a very different sort of answer.

287
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:22,921
What do we need?

288
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:26,681
We just need to open up a world, to be disclosers.

289
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:33,921
And when you're a discloser, then you've got objects about which you can make assertions directly.

290
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:44,881
That's what it is to be a discloser and open up a world, is to be able to relate to the things in the world by grabbing them, by seeing them, and by making assertions about them.

291
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:53,681
Just as you don't need any intermediate thing in order to grab them, or an intermediate thing in order to see them, you don't need an intermediate thing either to think about them.

292
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:57,201
This is this crucial sentence at the bottom of 261.

293
00:27:57,201 --> 00:28:03,441
Being true as being uncovering is in turn ontologically possible.

294
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:06,560
See, he's going to tell you his story now about how it's possible.

295
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,320
Ontologically possible only on the basis of being in the world.

296
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,201
The latter phenomenon, which we've known as a basic state of Dodd Zeign, is the foundation for the primordial phenomenon of truth.

297
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:19,681
That is, it makes truth possible.

298
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:23,921
And that's all you need to say.

299
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:25,760
Okay.

300
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:29,760
Yeah.

301
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:41,841
Next, Heidegger moves to something which I don't want to talk about, but I just want to talk about it long enough so that you know what happened when you read it.

302
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,801
And that is, there's something which I wish he hadn't even brought in here.

303
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:55,121
I'm going to leave it to division to the next semester when we go into authenticity and so forth.

304
00:28:55,121 --> 00:29:00,000
But he brings in what he calls the most primordial truth.

305
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:16,761
Lo and behold, more important than ontic correspondence and discovering, and more important than ontological disclosing and revealing, there's, what is this more primordial phenomenon of truth?

306
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,640
Well, I'm just going to mention it, and then we're not going to talk about it.

307
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:31,641
On 263, in italics, about 10 lines down, the most primordial phenomenon of truth is first shown by the existential ontological foundations of uncovering.

308
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:33,961
Now, look, you see, a new foundation.

309
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:39,480
There was already a foundation of ontic discovering and disclosing.

310
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,521
That's what he said at the bottom of 261: the foundation for the primordial phenomenon of truth.

311
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:53,800
But now we've got a new foundation, the most primordial, and so forth, and it's the foundation of uncovering.

312
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,401
Well, that means something goes back to Dasein.

313
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:12,681
That is, Dasein being the kind of being that takes a stand on itself and can flee and cover up the truth about itself, or can face up to the truth about itself, is going to turn out to be the most primordial.

314
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:15,800
I don't really understand why that's the most primordial.

315
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:18,760
If I did, I would save it till the next semester.

316
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,640
Maybe by next semester together, we'll all understand it.

317
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:24,121
But it's got to do with authenticity.

318
00:30:24,121 --> 00:30:26,840
That's why I'm putting it off to next semester.

319
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:40,840
So on 263, he says, the piece I just read, and on 264, he says, okay, the number three there on 264.

320
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,600
To Dasein's being belongs projection, disclosive being.

321
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:47,401
As something that understands, Dasein can understand itself.

322
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:49,240
You see, this has got to do with that.

323
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:56,681
The possibility just mentions means that Dasein discloses itself in and as its own most ability to be.

324
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,760
This authentic disclosiveness shows the phenomena of the most primordial truth in the mode of authenticity.

325
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:06,480
Now, you can well understand why we're not going to talk about that.

326
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:08,480
That requires a whole story.

327
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,080
So we're going on.

328
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,320
And where we're going is number three.

329
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,201
Remember, I said first he attacks the traditional view about truth.

330
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:20,800
Then he gives his own phenomenological view about truth.

331
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,321
And then he has to explain, well, how did we ever get into this wrong view?

332
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:34,641
If the phenomenon is the way he says it is, well, I'm going to have to, in his language, derive the traditional conception of truth from his kind of truth, truth is uncovering.

333
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:37,921
Had to explain how you get there.

334
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:40,401
And I think he has an interesting story about it.

335
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:47,441
I'm not sure the story comes out as clearly here as it does a little later, but we start with it here.

336
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:52,881
So, well, let me just say first.

337
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:59,681
Well, look, 266, the first full paragraph, because this is where he's going to do it.

338
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:16,321
Assertion and its structure, namely the apophantical as, pointing things out as they are in themselves, that should be obvious to you by now, are founded upon interpretation and its structure, namely the hermeneutical as, and also upon understanding upon Dasein's disclosedness.

339
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:22,160
Truth, however, is regarded as a distinctive character of an assertion, as so derived.

340
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:27,600
Much truth, however, is regarded as a distinctive character of assertion as so derived.

341
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:28,640
It's a funny sentence.

342
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,240
That's what it says.

343
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,120
Thus, the roots of the truth of assertion reach back to the disclosiveness of the understanding.

344
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,721
That's all review.

345
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:46,840
But over and above these indications of how the truth of assertion has originated, the phenomenon of agreement must now be exhibited explicitly in its derivative character.

346
00:32:47,161 --> 00:32:59,080
That means we've got to understand why philosophers thought that truth was a correspondence of something in the mind to something in the world all these years, and he's going to have to tell us.

347
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,441
And that means that he's going to see.

348
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,841
I used to think it meant, I think I even wrote it here, but I doubt it now, that there's something right about truth as correspondence.

349
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,160
I don't think that's the right way to put it.

350
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:33,321
There is another phenomenon which I just told you, which is a kind of agreement that he wants to describe, but I don't think there's anything right about truth as correspondence if that means the kind of correspondence of the mental thing with the world, with the outside thing, the inner with the outer.

351
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:46,121
The capacity for using an assertion, but okay, but now we're going to hear about how you get from the right use of assertions to the misunderstanding of assertions.

352
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:47,000
And so it goes.

353
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:52,921
There is a capacity for using assertions to point things out.

354
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:00,121
And that is using assertions as ready-to-hand to do a certain job.

355
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:04,601
So far, don't let me lose you, that's fine.

356
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:08,681
But now he's going to show how things start to go wrong.

357
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:16,360
But before I do, I've been talking too long, and I'm changing the subject sort of into this, deriving the mistake.

358
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,560
Doesn't anybody want to say anything about so far?

359
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:20,200
Yes.

360
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:22,760
Oh, none.

361
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,721
I'm using them.

362
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:24,521
Sorry.

363
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,401
But I think maybe we should make it a difference.

364
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:34,640
I think agreement is broad enough so that both the wrong people and Heidegger talk about agreement.

365
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,081
I think this is healthwater saying, or implying.

366
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:48,881
I think correspondence of the adequatio in Italy, which is getting translated correspondence from the medievals, is the wrong view.

367
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,321
And I think probably correspondence is always correspondence theory.

368
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,440
And he's going to say, when he was saving the phenomena, he's going to do it by talking about agreement.

369
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:01,840
Is that you?

370
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,561
You look worried.

371
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,560
You don't think that's what you were getting at?

372
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,400
That's what Mark's going to say.

373
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:15,201
Wayne, he doesn't want to eliminate agreement, I don't think.

374
00:35:15,521 --> 00:35:16,401
Yes.

375
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,240
Yes.

376
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,321
Where does he say he wants to eliminate agreement?

377
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,721
Yes, he should mean the correspondence theory.

378
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,840
I'm upset already.

379
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:29,841
The phenomenon of agreement must now be explicitly that sentence?

380
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,721
Ah, aha.

381
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,040
That seems wrong.

382
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:44,960
But while I've got it in front of me on 266, when he says the phenomenon of agreement must now be exhibited explicitly.

383
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,400
Oh, no, agreement is wrong, too.

384
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:50,401
I don't know what to make of this.

385
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:58,801
Because when he says here on 266, the end of the paragraph I just read, the phenomenon of agreement must now be exhibited explicitly in its derivative character.

386
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,920
So then we can't use correspondence or agreement without bringing in this wrong baggage.

387
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,521
You don't think correspondence is an okay word, do you?

388
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,280
That's what we want to eliminate.

389
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,400
And now he seems to suddenly talk about agreement as something we want to eliminate or derive.

390
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:20,361
Well, let me where have you got it?

391
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:23,400
262 on top.

392
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,880
Okay.

393
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,601
The primordial phenomenon and the derivative character of the traditional conception of truth.

394
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,920
Okay, I can see where we're going there.

395
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,480
Being true means being uncovering, but it's not a hard.

396
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:40,521
But by such drastic ways of defining the concept, we may succeed in eliminating the idea of agreement from the conception of truth.

397
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:47,240
And that's what some sort of some interlocutor says.

398
00:36:47,240 --> 00:37:01,960
And it seems to me he isn't trying to use the notion of agreement to get rid of something right about the conception of truth.

399
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,320
Now I'm really confused.

400
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,520
I don't know what to make of it.

401
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:10,760
What's the right way to describe the way we show things as they are in themselves, such that we point them out and so forth?

402
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:14,760
The phenomenon, what's the name of the phenomenon he's trying to save?

403
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,320
Assertions being true.

404
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,201
Is that all?

405
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:19,321
Truth.

406
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,121
Yeah, right, right.

407
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,401
Exactly.

408
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:33,721
But if he's going to call that correspondence and agreement, then he's going to eliminate all talk of correspondence.

409
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,480
I mean, don't get confused.

410
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:36,520
Wait, it's just a quality.

411
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,721
We agree, I think.

412
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:40,760
The question of what's really going on is okay.

413
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
If just the words are hard.

414
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,840
He wants to, just a second, Chris.

415
00:37:45,001 --> 00:38:10,321
He wants to describe a phenomenon which could have been described as agreement if it hadn't been, unfortunately, that agreement and correspondence have been taken over by the tradition, but he wants to save the phenomenon that agreement and probably correspondence were trying to get at.

416
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:12,400
And he doesn't have any words for that.

417
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,200
He just says, well, that's what he calls being true.

418
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:23,361
Remember, he says, assertions have this character of being true, and then he tells you what it is, letting things show themselves as they are in themselves.

419
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,801
Yeah, Curtis.

420
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,400
Yeah, I read that.

421
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,240
With what language, yeah?

422
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,121
I mean, it's clear that that's what he's doing.

423
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:49,601
But how is he going to describe it?

424
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,401
Uh-huh.

425
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,520
I don't know.

426
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:02,400
No, no, I don't.

427
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:19,681
I'm really confused now because he wants to save the primordial phenomenon of truth, and he wants to tell us a story about how, unfortunately, that turns into a talk about agreement and correspondence, and it shouldn't.

428
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:21,521
I mean, that's really what I'm talking about now.

429
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:37,441
He wants to derive why it seems appropriate to talk about agreement and correspondence, even though there are no entities anymore of the sort, like that the people who did, the intellectuals and ray people thought there were.

430
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,840
So what do you want to do?

431
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,881
Save those words or just save the phenomenon?

432
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:46,520
Yeah.

433
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:58,201
Where does he say he wants to meet?

434
00:39:58,201 --> 00:40:03,401
What he says he wants to appropriate primordially.

435
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:08,440
Yeah, I'm reading it, but he doesn't say it's agreement he wants to appropriate primordially.

436
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,440
He just wants to say that the tradition is supposed to be appropriate.

437
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,601
I can see that since the tradition is the correspondence theory.

438
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,800
Oh, it goes on.

439
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,440
I see one.

440
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,201
And we shall, no, that's interesting.

441
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,521
The idea of, oh, oh, I hadn't.

442
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:32,121
And we shall have done so all the more if we succeed in demonstrating the idea of agreement is one to which theory had to come.

443
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:33,641
Oh, no, that's not going to do it.

444
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:37,240
On the basis of primordial phenomena of truth, agreement is this.

445
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:40,521
I'm going to, this takes us right back to what I'm talking about.

446
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:50,121
Because agreement is exactly the wrong understanding to which the tradition had to come given the phenomenon of truth, is what he's saying here.

447
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,480
So I think Eugene, who got it is right.

448
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:58,441
The way he's using the words, I'm not taking back anything but words.

449
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:06,041
The way he's using the words, correspondence and agreement is the traditional view, and it's just plain wrong.

450
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:10,121
But there's a phenomenon behind it that they're trying to get at.

451
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:20,601
But we're not going to call that phenomenon behind it agreement or correspondence, because we don't have any of the right, the kind of entities that could, that they thought, you know, corresponded.

452
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:29,721
We've just got this kind of indicating of the thing itself as it is in itself, and we're not going to call that correspondence or agreement.

453
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:40,400
Well, that's tricky.

454
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,561
That's exactly what I'm going to talk about next.

455
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:50,961
He thinks it's a mistake to think of it as basic, and he's going to show you how you can derive it.

456
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,920
And I can't tell, but you all pay attention and see if we can.

457
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:13,841
Yes, what you're raising is the question: when he derives the traditional view, is he telling you it has in its own domain a limited derivative kind of applicability and legitimacy, or is he telling you I'm showing how this wrong-headed view, which is totally wrong-headed, ever got off the ground?

458
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,800
I can't tell.

459
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,721
But we're going to read the passages in a minute.

460
00:42:16,721 --> 00:42:18,321
Maybe somebody will tell.

461
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:19,680
So let's read them.

462
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,961
We perfectly set up the next move.

463
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,841
So 267 is where I say we are now.

464
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:30,561
And so let's go there and see.

465
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:33,280
And I've written, this is where Eugene interrupted.

466
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,280
And I said there's something right about truth as correspondence.

467
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,841
Now I want to write in my margin, no.

468
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,681
I think that's probably not going to turn out to be the case, but let's see.

469
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:45,280
267.

470
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:49,121
And we're going to go through this.

471
00:42:50,481 --> 00:43:08,161
I've just sort of picked out the passages for starting sort of the basic story is, I'll just blurt it out, that we use assertions as ready-to-hand equipment to point out objects as they are in themselves.

472
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:09,760
That's fine.

473
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:23,801
But then we reflect on what we do and we think of the assertions as present-at-hand relating to the present-at-hand object when we're not actually using them as equipment to point things out.

474
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:31,561
And as soon as we do that, then we can't understand anymore what's going on because we don't know how to relate a present-at-hand assertion.

475
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:51,321
They're not being used in some particular context to point out some way some object is in itself, but just to think about how the assertion, this lectern is brown, abstractly in class sitting here, relates to this object brown.

476
00:43:51,320 --> 00:44:03,961
And when I'm not using it in a context to point something out, it's just talking about it, then you start getting a theory about it, and you start treating the assertion as present at hand, he says.

477
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:10,280
And now I'll read it, and we'll see if we can see whether this leads to some interesting truth about things.

478
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,760
Truth, never mind, that blow your mind.

479
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,041
I don't mean the word truth.

480
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:18,201
Whether something important is revealed when you make these moves.

481
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:38,040
But you make a bunch of moves, he's going to say, from the assertion working well in a context, indicating something and being ready to hand, to its being present at hand, and the object it's pointing out being present at hand, and the relation between the two having to be also present at hand, then you've got the correspondence here.

482
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,521
And I think that's what's happening on 267.

483
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:43,240
So let's, I'm going to go about 15 lines down.

484
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,721
The assertion is something ready to hand.

485
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:52,280
The entities to which it is related as something that uncovers are either ready to hand or present at hand within the world.

486
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,401
Sounds right.

487
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:01,680
The relation itself presents itself thus, as one that is present at hand.

488
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:07,280
I think that I tried to fix that to more plausibleness in the German.

489
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,280
The relation can be taken as one that is present at hand.

490
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,360
I mean, if you say the relation presents itself as present at hand, maybe it doesn't matter.

491
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:25,681
If you stand back and just describe what's going on, it presents itself as present at hand, and you take it as present at hand.

492
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,801
It's okay.

493
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,600
And now skipping down to after where it says Kant there.

494
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:40,000
But the relation itself now acquires the character of presence at hand by getting switched over to a relationship between things that are present at hand.

495
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:45,121
So the object's present at hand, the assertion is present at hand, so the relation now gets switched over.

496
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:58,401
The uncoveredness of something becomes the present-at-hand conformity, that's agreement, that's correspondence, of one thing which is present at hand, the assertion, to something else which is present at hand, the entity under discussion.

497
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:14,881
And then just skipping down at the end of the paragraph, then the relation shows itself as an agreement or correspondence, you could have either, of two things which are present at hand, an agreement which is present at hand.

498
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,641
And now you've got the tradition.

499
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:21,280
That's a quick derivation that he just throws at you.

500
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,481
Now he says, I've derived the correspondence theory, isn't that terrific?

501
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:28,240
At the bottom of the page.

502
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:43,600
Though it is founded upon Dasein's disclosiveness, the existential phenomenon of uncoveredness becomes a property which is present at hand, but in which there still lurks a relation of character, and as such, a property, it gets broken into a relationship which is present at hand.

503
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:44,400
I mean, that's all.

504
00:46:44,601 --> 00:47:07,001
Then truth as disclosedness, as a being towards uncovered entities, a being which itself uncovers, that's all the right story, has become truth as agreement between things that are present at hand within the world, and thus we have pointed out the ontologically derivative character of the traditional conception of truth.

505
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:15,081
Now, nothing in there seems to suggest that there's anything useful at all about it, I'm afraid, or for better or for worse.

506
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:18,601
It just seems to say that's how you get it, and it's wrong.

507
00:47:19,481 --> 00:47:21,641
Or, well, let's not say wrong.

508
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:25,001
It's it's the well, this is the question.

509
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:42,601
Is it the proper present-at-hand description of what's going on, which you can now use in logic, which is after all a discipline that has an interesting history of its own, which he isn't against, and uh and and Aristotle and whose views about judgment were already like this?

510
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,681
I guess I think it could he can't think it's just plain wrong.

511
00:47:46,681 --> 00:47:52,521
I mean, it would be bad to be thinking that Aristotle, for him, that Aristotle was just plain wrong, I believe.

512
00:47:52,521 --> 00:48:08,121
So, what he's got to think is if you want to manipulate formal structures when you talk about intelligibility and language, then you've got to bring in judgment and you can you're going to have to bring in the present at hand story.

513
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,080
Of course, it's I don't know, because it's going to be unintelligible.

514
00:48:13,081 --> 00:48:13,960
We we know.

515
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,280
So, what good is an unintelligible story though, on the basis of which you could do logic?

516
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,321
I don't know.

517
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,080
Well, let's read the rest of the quotes.

518
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:26,361
I j I came in here totally puzzled by this, so I'm happy that now we're all puzzled by it.

519
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,721
267, I just did, didn't I?

520
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,480
Yes.

521
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:33,120
Yeah, okay.

522
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,880
Now let me see where I am.

523
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,080
268 is the next move, it seems to me.

524
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,201
Let's do the italics.

525
00:48:39,201 --> 00:48:41,841
That might be important on 268.

526
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,001
He said, we've derived the correspondence theory 268.

527
00:48:50,001 --> 00:48:50,960
Yeah, at the top.

528
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,240
Okay, now the italics.

529
00:48:52,240 --> 00:49:05,041
The primordial phenomenon of truth has been covered up by Dasein's very way of being, the understanding, which is approximately the one that prevails, which even today has been surmounted explicitly and in principle.

530
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:11,121
But has not, well, has not, good, been surmounted explicitly and in principle, as he has.

531
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:13,201
So what's the answer?

532
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:23,521
Now that we've derived the 2,000 years of philosophy and logic, have we just shown that they ought to be thrown in the garbage, that there was an intuition behind them, but that they lost it?

533
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:24,880
Or are we supposed to not?

534
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:26,881
I can't tell.

535
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,401
Yeah.

536
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:35,201
What do you think relationships called?

537
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:37,841
Our what?

538
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:41,601
Relation, is he saying?

539
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:56,961
No, he's saying that tradition, once it's stopped using assertions in a ready-to-hand way in a situation to point out objects, then the assertions are present at hand and the objects are present at hand and the relation between them is present at hand.

540
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,240
It isn't really, but I mean, well, really, that's a funny way to put it.

541
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,001
It isn't when we're at our most basic way of being in the world and disclosing.

542
00:50:06,001 --> 00:50:07,760
But it really looks that way.

543
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,161
It really is that way when we stand back and describe it.

544
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:19,481
But the interesting thing is, instead of saying, as with space, now I'm just leaving my notes behind and trying to think.

545
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:22,520
Where with space he says, well, Descartes got something right.

546
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:24,440
You can stand back and describe space.

547
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:31,721
And then you get rid of all this existential spatiality, and there's nothing, no place for here and there, and no places and everything.

548
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:33,320
And good for a Descartes.

549
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,320
He got that in Galileo.

550
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:41,400
They discovered that if you leave all that stuff out, you get to something important, real, and incredibly valuable.

551
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,960
And you make satellites and spaceships and everything.

552
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:47,721
That's nice.

553
00:50:47,721 --> 00:51:04,841
But here, he seems to be saying, if you do that kind of leaving out of the involved level of disclosing, you get something incoherent, a kind of artifact with which you can't understand anything or do anything.

554
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,560
It's funny because mostly he respects the getting.

555
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:18,201
When he did the derivation of logic, he didn't say that you can get to a predicate calculus if you leave out aspects of it.

556
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,561
Let's go through that.

557
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:20,440
He did logic.

558
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,161
He said, well, there's hammering going on.

559
00:51:23,161 --> 00:51:24,760
Then there's unready to hand.

560
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,521
The hammer is too heavy.

561
00:51:26,521 --> 00:51:31,721
Then you can go to the present at hand and say the hammer has the property brown.

562
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,120
And then you can write logic about that.

563
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:35,401
And why not?

564
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,680
Then that was fine.

565
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:38,121
And so everybody can do logic.

566
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:44,360
And he thinks it's bad to forget where logic came from and think that it'll do everything, that it will do something.

567
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,161
It does a lot when in your computers.

568
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:54,601
But now he tells us a story about truth in which it looks like truth is just the traditional view of truth is just junk.

569
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,240
Okay, yes, yes.

570
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,760
Okay, he he I think he just takes over the traditional view about abstraction.

571
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:24,321
He doesn't ask how we get from collies to dogs and dogs to animals and animals to entities and stuff.

572
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,961
We make those kinds of abstractions.

573
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,161
It's again like thinking.

574
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:41,360
There's all kinds of ways we relate to the world which he has not gotten a story about because he's too busy sort of he's ready to leave in general.

575
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,760
Oh this case of truth is a funny case.

576
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,961
In general he's ready to leave the tradition and have these upper levels of the conceptual.

577
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,320
It's an upper level.

578
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,360
That's right.

579
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,321
It's an upper level for him and the tradition is full of interesting stories about concepts.

580
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:04,080
I bet if he was writing about it, maybe he is somewhere, he'd say the notion of concept is pretty confused too, like agreement.

581
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:11,041
It's not easy just because you can't just sort of wheel in the idea of concept whenever you please as if you knew what it was.

582
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:22,081
But he's not going to say that it's his business to say somehow that he's got a better understanding of the phenomena or that the notion of concepts is useless.

583
00:53:22,081 --> 00:53:25,121
But he does seem to say the notion of correspondence is useless.

584
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:25,600
Yeah.

585
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,920
The relationship that it has between the two is version one thing that's all about the relation by the change that we put on.

586
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:46,760
He talks about that.

587
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,360
I think he thinks that truth is a special case of indication, isn't that what he says?

588
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:57,161
He says that truth isn't just any old indication, is what I think he says back here.

589
00:53:57,161 --> 00:54:00,200
It's a special kind of indication, and then he tells you what?

590
00:54:00,201 --> 00:54:08,681
A kind of indication of something as it is in itself, whereas some kind of indication is that the path turns to the right.

591
00:54:09,081 --> 00:54:11,400
So indication is a much bigger notion.

592
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,240
I think that's his story.

593
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,480
So anyway, and you know what is going to help me here?

594
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:17,721
Nobody's going to tell us what to do about this.

595
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,800
I mean, you see the problem?

596
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,081
One, you don't want to throw out the whole story about truth.

597
00:54:23,081 --> 00:54:26,360
And he doesn't usually throw out the tradition.

598
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:40,201
He usually derives the tradition at the end of any of these stories and tells you it's got its legitimate, derivative, privative, having left out most of what's important and interesting, story to tell.

599
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:46,040
And sometimes, like with Descartes and science, that turns out to be a powerful thing to do.

600
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:48,921
And with logic, I mean, it's a powerful thing to do.

601
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,721
But here it's not a powerful thing to do, I guess.

602
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:52,200
Yeah.

603
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:07,161
Well, well it's because of the I'm I'm well okay, I'll tell you where I see it, and you can tell me why I shouldn't see it there.

604
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:08,840
It's because he says it's incoherent.

605
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:14,601
We have no idea how to make sense of the adequatio of the intellectus and race.

606
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:22,041
And if it's true that we have no idea how to make sense of it, it's so incoherent idea, then it's hard to save it.

607
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:27,320
Wait, let me let me have some more.

608
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:28,201
Go ahead.

609
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:39,040
That's right.

610
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:45,200
He he lo I according to me, he likes science and he understands it better than anybody before Kunt.

611
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,681
Well, yeah, it's not.

612
00:55:56,001 --> 00:55:57,121
You don't see it.

613
00:55:57,121 --> 00:56:00,561
Well, how do you respond to this thing which is on my mind?

614
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:24,480
If there really is no way to make sense of the agreement of anything mental or subjective or ideal with anything objective and real, if there's if that's a completely, and it does seem to be, incomprehensible relation that they could ever correspond or agree with each other, it's two such totally different domains, then it looks like it's useless.

615
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,280
I mean, I don't know what you mean by making sense of it.

616
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:30,561
It might have some kind of use without either.

617
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,600
And maybe the point is, maybe that's interesting.

618
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:41,601
Maybe the point has to be, you can go on talking that way, and it may be useful sometime to talk that way.

619
00:56:41,601 --> 00:56:49,680
And you just don't, as long as you don't, I don't know why, think that you're getting at anything deep and important.

620
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:10,081
You don't have to get anywhere with it's already in the idea that it's already been done there.

621
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,240
Okay, yeah, yeah.

622
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:21,721
Yeah, analytic agreements can not be really getting anywhere in terms of the things itself.

623
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:25,960
Well, I guess the question ought to be, sort of, what can you do with it?

624
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:33,480
I mean, I mean, I haven't thought about this, but I mean, is it doing anybody any good to have this notion of truth, this correspondence?

625
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:43,320
Shouldn't we just sort of make a Davidsonian or a Tarskian or a Rordian completely empty definition of truth and just get rid of a correspondence in agreement?

626
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:57,161
Agreement of what to when you do it in math, what's the agree agreement of what with what?

627
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,041
I can try to go with an example of fine.

628
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:13,320
But you can buy certain principles, even if we agree, move the next step, then drive it.

629
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,681
I don't know.

630
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,440
Depends on, well, I don't know.

631
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:16,920
I don't know.

632
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,201
I can't tell from what you're saying.

633
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,641
Don't say more right now.

634
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:20,201
Dave, yeah.

635
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:28,760
Why does it have to just get that there's a real phenomenal agreement that the tradition has specifically misunderstood?

636
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:44,681
If actually I can say traditional hands not explained and fallen into the other thing, that there is a really right way of thinking about agreement.

637
00:58:44,681 --> 00:58:46,681
I came in here thinking that.

638
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:47,960
But I don't think he thinks that.

639
00:58:47,960 --> 00:59:00,800
There's a phenomenon, but agreement and correspondence doesn't grasp it because there's not the kind of stuff that could agree in the in unless you've got this minimal, again, empty notion of agreement.

640
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:17,121
That when you point out an object as, when I point this, when I say the lectern is brown, and that is true if the lectern, what, in itself is brown.

641
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,600
Those itself is brown, I should say, yeah.

642
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,001
Basically, 361.

643
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:29,441
The accident is showing itself in itself sameness.

644
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,921
Yes, well, that's what I was just trying to say.

645
00:59:36,721 --> 00:59:40,800
Okay, that's okay.

646
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,600
I think that's right.

647
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:43,121
That's the phenomenon.

648
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:55,121
Now, so all we have to do, and that's what he wants to make the truth, he wants to show the phenomenal context of demonstration, the relation of agreement will become visible.

649
00:59:55,121 --> 00:59:58,320
So that's the main line supporting the view you're holding.

650
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:03,601
That he's trying to, that that's what is the phenomenon of agreement, and he's made it visible.

651
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:08,001
That's what really happened.

652
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:14,081
How do you know it really happened except that you draw out the phenomenon in such a way that they cohere with themselves?

653
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,360
We don't want to get a coherence view of truth would do with it.

654
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,080
Wait, wait, wait.

655
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:29,121
Okay, but you have to draw out there.

656
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,161
That's the truth.

657
01:00:31,721 --> 01:00:35,920
Uh the accident is what it is, and it's neither true nor false.

658
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:59,800
The truth or false view is when the powder has been drawn out in the axiom of either the assertion is also uh what I see is the assertion draws out an agreement that happens between some so in the accident there's no point false because the assertion isn't quite fine.

659
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:10,760
It lets the state of affairs it lets the uh the entity show itself as it is in this.

660
01:01:23,641 --> 01:01:28,361
And and and when you try to draw out how it is, you do it with your assertion.

661
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:35,480
But is there but but he, I think, having I came in here with the idea, and that's the true phenomenon of agreement and correspondence.

662
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:47,081
But I every passage seems to suggest, no, that's not, because it hasn't got the right any elements in it, that each sort of self-sufficient and then related to the other one.

663
01:01:47,081 --> 01:01:51,160
And therefore there's no way to characterize it as agreement and correspondence.

664
01:01:51,161 --> 01:01:52,120
We don't find any way.

665
01:01:52,121 --> 01:01:54,521
We tried of half an hour ago.

666
01:01:54,521 --> 01:02:02,920
And therefore the whole way of talking of truth as agreement and correspondence was going to be useless to us, so we just drop it.

667
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:03,800
Yeah.

668
01:02:27,081 --> 01:02:29,641
So that's where the assertion is in agreement.

669
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:57,360
Let me just stop the conversation because I just found two sentences which seem to me to take these two different sides that you guys are just taking, and I just don't know what to say, but I'll just point them out.

670
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:06,081
On 260, David fits perfectly well with this claim that we've read it already at the end, 260 at the end of the top paragraph.

671
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:13,201
Thus, in the phenomenal context of demonstration, the relationship of agreement must become visible.

672
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:25,440
And if that's his view, and he's not sort of attributing it to the other guys, then he's trying to make some new phenomenological description of agreement.

673
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:38,801
But now, if you flip over to 266, he's saying at the end of the top paragraph, the phenomenon of agreement must now be exhibited explicitly in its derivative character.

674
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,760
Oh, that's interesting.

675
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,721
So then he's saying there is a phenomenon of agreement.

676
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:51,041
And that means, namely, something present at hand.

677
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:53,120
But then how can that be?

678
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:55,520
Yeah, I don't know.

679
01:03:55,521 --> 01:03:58,400
But I miss, I mean, I thought I had something exciting to say.

680
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:11,280
Scratch what I just was saying, because it looks like when he does do the phenomenon of agreement in its derivative character, he seems to be saying that there's nothing left of it.

681
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,041
Yeah, that's the phenomenon.

682
01:04:22,601 --> 01:04:24,601
Yeah, that's good.

683
01:04:24,601 --> 01:04:25,320
That's good.

684
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:25,880
You agree?

685
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,520
I agree.

686
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:27,480
Let's all say that.

687
01:04:27,481 --> 01:04:27,960
Right.

688
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:35,240
There's the phenomenon description which gets it right as it points out the object and it agrees with the object agrees with itself.

689
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,161
And then there's what the tradition made of this phenomenon of agreement.

690
01:04:39,161 --> 01:04:40,441
And they got it wrong.

691
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:47,161
And Heidegger wants to stave the phenomenon of agreement, but I think he doesn't want to call it agreement.

692
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:47,800
Well, I don't know.

693
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,681
Well, back to this again.

694
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:53,081
The phenomenon of agreement will now be demonstrated in its derivative character.

695
01:04:54,681 --> 01:05:14,201
It's like a funny sentence because it looks like when he derives it as the present-at-hand relation of an assertion with an object, he's making it clear that there's nothing there to describe because the assertion becomes a present-at-hand relation and that's unintelligible.

696
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:27,641
So if there's nothing there to describe, what's he talking about when he's deriving it in its making it deriving it?

697
01:05:28,681 --> 01:05:30,201
I still don't understand it.

698
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:31,960
But anyway, I don't want to get stuck on it.

699
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:32,840
I am stuck on it.

700
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,680
But I know I want to get unstuck.

701
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:38,601
So let's do, I mean, I want to just see where I am and then go on.

702
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,400
I leave it to you all to worry about it.

703
01:05:42,681 --> 01:05:46,440
Luckily, it isn't something that makes a big deal to worry about.

704
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,201
I don't think it matters all that much.

705
01:05:48,201 --> 01:05:52,041
We spend a lot of time on it, because he spends a lot of time on it.

706
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,201
Let's see now.

707
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:56,121
Okay, we got that.

708
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:29,841
So he's derived the correspondence theory, he says, and on 268 he says he just says it again, bottom of 267, truth is disclosedness as a being towards uncovered entities, being which itself uncovers, that's the good thing, has become, now that's the bad thing, truth is agreement between things that are present at hand within the world, and thus we have pointed out the ontologically derivative character of the traditional conception of truth.

709
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:36,561
And so now we want to, he doesn't tell us, at least I haven't got any quote that tells us, so we just leave it.

710
01:06:36,561 --> 01:06:41,201
Is this derivative something or other useful in some way?

711
01:06:41,601 --> 01:06:48,240
Got something correct, if not deeply right, or is it just incoherent?

712
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,120
I just don't know.

713
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:50,400
Keep your eyes open.

714
01:06:50,400 --> 01:07:00,641
Now, I've got to get done to the rest of this because we've got to, of course, we're going to do, from now on, next time we're going to do the first introduction, and the next time we're going to do the second introduction.

715
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:03,280
So now I have to finish the book before we get to that.

716
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,600
And I have all of 10 minutes, which is not bad.

717
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:08,801
There's only one more thing to do.

718
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,601
Truth and realism on 269.

719
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:25,841
All I want to say about that is that just as the real depends on us, but reality, I'm sorry, reality depends on us, but the real doesn't.

720
01:07:26,161 --> 01:07:31,440
So truth depends on us, but what is true doesn't.

721
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:40,400
And he's just making that connection here, I think, on 269 at the beginning of the kind of being the truth possesses.

722
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:44,601
So I'm going to read, starting with the second sentence at the beginning of that.

723
01:07:44,241 --> 01:07:48,441
There is truth only insofar as Dasein is, and so long as Dasein is.

724
01:07:48,601 --> 01:07:54,360
Entities are uncovered only when Daseine is, and only as long as Dasein is, are they disclosed.

725
01:07:54,361 --> 01:08:05,880
And then we get this thing about Newton's laws, that they are anything like this, can only be disclosed when we're around as disclosers.

726
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:16,280
But that doesn't mean that the truth of these laws, what the laws are true of, comes into being when we disclose them.

727
01:08:16,281 --> 01:08:21,800
That is, when they become, well, when we disclose them is when they become true.

728
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:35,561
But there is a sense that when they become true, they turn out to describe something which has been there all along, the laws of Newton's laws.

729
01:08:35,561 --> 01:08:39,080
And I take it, I tried to say it, I'll say it again.

730
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:44,200
I think that's the same form as reality depends on us, but the real doesn't.

731
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:52,120
Truth, that is revealing, depends on us, but what is revealed, what is disclosed, what is discovered, doesn't.

732
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,960
And that seems okay to me.

733
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,960
And I think that's what he's saying here.

734
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,520
So let me just find the other places.

735
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:10,200
Once things are uncovered, that is found, that is revealed, that is, we make true assertions about them, it turns out that they were there all along.

736
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,760
So I think that what is true doesn't depend on us.

737
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,400
But I'm not sure that I'm using the language in the way he wants to use it.

738
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:22,440
This is what I'm trying to explain at the bottom of 269.

739
01:09:22,441 --> 01:09:25,240
Through through Newton, the laws became true.

740
01:09:25,241 --> 01:09:29,840
That is, Newton disclosed them, that is, or discovered them.

741
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,880
I'm not sure which.

742
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,800
It's tricky there.

743
01:09:29,401 --> 01:09:34,481
Depends on.

744
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:45,681
If Newton worked out the whole Newtonian way of looking at reality, I don't want to say reality, looking at the way things are, then he disclosed something.

745
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:51,840
If Newton discovered that things fall at a certain speed, you know, what happened?

746
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,880
Never mind the formula, then that would be discovering something.

747
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:03,200
Newton, being this great character, is not just a scientist, he's the New World discloser.

748
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:11,681
So he's disclosing things, and on the basis of what he discloses, that becomes a disciplinary matrix on which scientists can discover things.

749
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:16,880
And through Newton, the laws became true, and with them, entities became accessible in themselves.

750
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,120
That is, what they were true of is now accessible.

751
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,681
But what they were true of was there all along.

752
01:10:23,681 --> 01:10:28,721
Once entities have been uncovered, they show themselves as entities which beforehand already were.

753
01:10:28,721 --> 01:10:39,920
That's so what the truth is true of has been there all along, and we get access to that by way of true assertions.

754
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,880
But the true assertions, though, they depend on us.

755
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,721
What we get access to through the true assertions doesn't depend on us.

756
01:10:46,721 --> 01:10:49,920
I think it's exactly the same kind of argument.

757
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:55,920
So, true and yeah, I'm just saying it over and over here.

758
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,681
In general, disclosing depends on us.

759
01:10:57,681 --> 01:11:00,641
Okay, I say it three times in my notes.

760
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,641
We've got to get to truth and being.

761
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:04,080
That's the last thing.

762
01:11:04,481 --> 01:11:06,880
It's a sort of funny move.

763
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,040
Truth and being turn out to be, of course, very intimately related.

764
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,200
Here's my story about it.

765
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:14,481
And I'm not sure it's right.

766
01:11:14,601 --> 01:11:15,561
You have to check.

767
01:11:15,561 --> 01:11:22,681
But anyway, he says, you know, I'm trying to explain the line that truth and being are equiprimordial.

768
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:23,641
Where is it?

769
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:25,321
Somebody help me find it.

770
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:28,440
It's right at the end of this part somewhere.

771
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:30,360
Maybe I wrote it down.

772
01:11:32,601 --> 01:11:36,920
Yeah, here on two, where it says 230 in the margin, on 272.

773
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,960
The being of truth is connected primordially with Dasein.

774
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:47,160
And only because Dasein is as constituted by disclosedness, that is, by understanding, can anything like being be understood?

775
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:53,480
And so it is possible, and so is it possible to understand being.

776
01:11:53,481 --> 01:11:59,401
And then the next sentence: being, not entities, is something which there is only so far as truth is.

777
01:11:59,401 --> 01:12:03,160
Now we've got being, reality, and truth all have this funny character.

778
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:12,840
That as disclosed, as disclosing, the disclosedness of anything of the real depends on us.

779
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:19,320
The disclosing of being, disclosing of truth, but then what they reveal doesn't depend on us.

780
01:12:19,321 --> 01:12:23,641
So being, not entities, is something that there is only insofar as truth is.

781
01:12:23,641 --> 01:12:30,601
And truth is only so far and as long as Dasein is, being and truth are equiprimordially.

782
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:34,520
Okay, here's my attempt to give the feel, the phenomena for that.

783
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:44,681
So if being is that on the basis of which being are already understood, then being is very close to being familiarity.

784
01:12:44,681 --> 01:12:46,200
I think it's the same.

785
01:12:46,521 --> 01:12:49,000
It's background coping.

786
01:12:49,641 --> 01:12:53,240
It's what makes possible intelligibility.

787
01:12:53,241 --> 01:12:58,601
That is, being is that on the basis of which beings are already understood.

788
01:12:58,601 --> 01:12:59,721
And where does truth come in?

789
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,160
Truth is disclosedness.

790
01:13:02,481 --> 01:13:07,360
It's that on the basis of which beings are uncovered as they are.

791
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:10,320
But that's also background coping.

792
01:13:10,321 --> 01:13:15,040
That's that one, it's so close that you would hardly distinguish them.

793
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:26,320
Being is what is that makes everything makes intelligibility possible.

794
01:13:26,321 --> 01:13:32,480
And truth makes encountering what is intelligible possible, I think.

795
01:13:32,481 --> 01:13:34,160
And they're that close together.

796
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:42,000
Both depend on Dasein, and both of them go back to Dasein taking a stand on its own being by way of coping in the world.

797
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,080
So I think that's what I was just, oh, I want to read that a little more in a second.

798
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,760
And now, why would I say that?

799
01:13:49,760 --> 01:14:00,080
Well, I think that the role of understanding on 272, where it says 230, what I just read, but I want to read it again now with a different emphasis.

800
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,040
The being of truth is connected primarily with being a Dasein.

801
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:10,320
Yes, and only because Dasein is as constituted by disclosedness, that is, by understanding, can anything like being be understood?

802
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:13,280
Only so is it possible to understand being.

803
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:25,200
Well, remember, understanding as sort of basic coping or dealing is way back in the beginning, turns out to be very close to familiarity.

804
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:39,200
And he says that it's that you finally, the understanding of being, as I understand it, is just the holistic coping that makes rooms familiar and finally makes the world familiar.

805
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:49,480
And so he can say that together, sort of by, let's see.

806
01:14:49,800 --> 01:15:01,080
So both intelligibility, which depends, which is what being gives us, and encountering, which is what truth gives us, go together.

807
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:12,360
And together, they are, I mean, I don't know whether they whether to say they are made possible by coping or they make coping possible.

808
01:15:14,441 --> 01:15:16,360
I think coping is more basic.

809
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:24,360
I think coping is what makes possible intelligibility, and coping is what makes possible encountering.

810
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:27,561
And that, and I'm going to start with this next time.

811
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,160
Now read Introduction 1.

812
01:15:31,481 --> 01:15:38,360
I think what being turns out to be when you read Introduction 1 is holistic background coping.

813
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:49,160
And see if, I don't know if that's right, but I mean, that's at least a candidate, because you're trying to figure out when you read Introduction 1, now that you've read all of Part 1 of Being in Time.

814
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,481
So what is the right story about being?

815
01:15:51,481 --> 01:15:58,840
He has a list of the wrong stories about being and a list of what sort of glimmer of truth is in each of them.

816
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:13,400
Now you have to take those wrong stories and the glimmer of truth in each of them and see if on the basis of that you can understand what being is according to Heidegger, as opposed to all the mistaken views in the tradition.

817
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:14,601
That's where we're going to start.

818
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:16,280
I just want to make sure I'm ready to start.

819
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:16,601
Yeah.

820
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:18,681
So we're going to start with what being isn't.

821
01:16:18,681 --> 01:16:25,480
And we're going to try to figure out on the basis of that what being is according to chapter one.

822
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,601
Okay.
