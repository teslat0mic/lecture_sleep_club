1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Yeah, then let's go back to the issues around mood.

2
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:15,760
The in this I think is very important, but I can't go back over it not because there's no time, but because I don't know what more to say.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:23,920
So I'll just repeat the sort of mantra that says the right thing, but somehow it's very hard to spell it out.

4
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:32,399
That is, each person has their own disclosing power, but the world they disclose is the same world you disclose.

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,000
The world I disclose is the same world you disclose, although I disclose it from here, and you disclose it from yonder.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,239
And I mean, I see you, you see me.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,519
I disclose it with my for the sake of, you disclose it with your for the sake ofs.

8
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:54,479
You're absorbed in coping with the equipment and with others that are in your situation.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,440
And all of that means that you're something like an open head turned toward the world from somewhere.

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,680
That we've had the world and now we've got the from somewhere.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:19,880
But you've got to be very careful and not think of that as some private representation, not even some sort of Renaissance three-dimensional picture that you've got somewhere inside you or in your brain.

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:31,159
Of course, your brain has got something in it, which is, it wouldn't be there if the world wasn't the way it is, and wouldn't be there if it weren't your brain and not from your perspective, but that's irrelevant.

13
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:46,920
We're trying to do phenomenology and ontology and describe this very, very difficult thing that we are a shared, we are somehow individual disclosers disclosing a shared world.

14
00:01:46,920 --> 00:02:01,399
And Descartes went way overboard in the direction of the individualness of the individual disclosers, thinking that each of them had their own world, their own private stream of experiences, their own co-internal representations.

15
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,399
And that's clearly wrong.

16
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:15,800
Heidegger, purposely, I think, goes way overboard on the side of the world and doesn't even mention this sort of big deal problem that we all seem to have our own experiences, our own moods, our own for the sake of.

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:28,119
When he's talking about worldhood, he doesn't have to, and he's bending you over backwards to keep, put you in an anti-Cartesian frame of mind, but now he's got to put it all together.

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:36,360
And so my slogan is: Dasein is always in the world by way of its situation.

19
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,600
It's there.

20
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,800
But the traditional view is so strong.

21
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:58,040
I didn't mention last time, though I already had it in mind, that to try to give you an example of how pervasive this Cartesianism is, it isn't just people in artificial intelligence or Cartesian philosophers.

22
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,000
My favorite example is Sesame Street.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,520
Sesame Street is so proper.

24
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:14,240
And Sesame Street doesn't want to bring in any assumptions that are somehow tied up with anybody's position or class or race or anything else.

25
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,920
They just want to describe in the simplest down-to-earth way what the world is like.

26
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,639
So you'd think they might be sort of Heideggerians.

27
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:32,880
But if any of you who remember your times watching Sesame Street, you have help somebody.

28
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:43,199
Okay, you have two kids in Sesame Street and a flower.

29
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,399
And this kid sees the flower, and guess what?

30
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:50,079
He gets a representation of the flower in his mind.

31
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,880
And then he says, flower.

32
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,719
And then, guess what?

33
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,800
This kid gets a representation of the flower in his mind.

34
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
That's all pure Descartes.

35
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:08,800
I mean, the poor kids are being totally brainwashed into the inner sense model of the mind.

36
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,240
And one more example closer to home.

37
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,479
Have any of you had any courses from Allison Gopnik in the psychology department?

38
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:44,880
She's sort of, we're friends, but intellectually, she's the enemy, sort of my nemesis, because her whole research is devoted to asking the question: when do children stop having sort of foolish views about their relation to reality, namely that their open heads turned toward the world, and start understanding what she calls the idea idea, that all they've got is their own private inner representations of the world.

39
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,159
And they invent all kinds of interesting experiments to show when and look and see when this switchover takes place.

40
00:04:51,399 --> 00:05:01,000
So, for example, you show a kid, this is one of Gottnik's famous experiments, a box of pencils, but it looks like a candy box.

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,840
And the kid looks at it and looks inside and is disappointed, expected candy, saw the pencils.

42
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,760
I forget what age this is.

43
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,199
I have no idea.

44
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm going to just guess around three.

45
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:21,800
But anyway, then you get another kid, the same age, coming into the room, and you ask the first kid, what does the kid coming into the room think is in that box?

46
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,120
And the answer is pencils.

47
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:33,080
Because from that, the kid hasn't learned yet that he's got his own perspective on the world and he knows more and he knows they're pencils.

48
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:41,880
And the other kid, seeing the world from its perspective, doesn't know that they're pencils and is fooled as the first kid was in thinking there's candy.

49
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:55,240
And now Allison Gottnick thinks, aha, we could just keep giving this test, and at some point, we'll find out at what age the kid finally gets it, that it's got its own internal knowledge of the world, each one of them.

50
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,519
And what do you say to that?

51
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,840
It looks like a solid experiment.

52
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Well, what I want to say to it is, what Heidegger would have to say to it is something like, well, what you're studying, Alison Gottnick, is a very interesting thing.

53
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:32,360
It's how culture, how the culture brainwashes the people, our culture, the children in it, into giving a certain interpretation to the fact that it's true that different people know different things about the world, and different people have different perspectives, that they are, they are, they have a perspective that you cover up, but they're all open to the same world from each of their own perspectives.

54
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:41,200
She sort of congratulates them, I presume, on saying, Wow, now you're getting that you really understand the relation of the mind to reality.

55
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,480
And I've been wanting that, I never get time to give a seminar with her in which I say this is interesting work.

56
00:06:46,480 --> 00:07:01,519
We have to study how in the world everybody gets brainwashed into this mistaken Cartesian picture of our relation to reality, which the Homerics didn't have, and Augustine didn't have, and it wasn't around till Descartes.

57
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:10,160
Somehow, their kids didn't grow up ever with getting the right picture, namely the idea, idea, the internal representation idea.

58
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:15,039
So, how did we, how come, how could, where do we, how do we get our kids to all grow up and believe it?

59
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:23,920
So, if you took them all into a class and asked them questions, you'd get them to say, Well, I've got my private experiences, and you've got yours.

60
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,480
Okay, that's all just background.

61
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,840
How hard and how important this is, and how, well, period, for that.

62
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,399
Now, let's go on to moods.

63
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,319
Moods are global, and we talked about that already.

64
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,880
They're like an atmosphere, they're contagious.

65
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:51,680
It's so important on the subject of moods, which is the first of the being in chapters, that Heidegger is sort of turning the picture upside down.

66
00:07:51,679 --> 00:08:00,560
Instead of saying that everybody's got their mood, and out of that somehow is constructed the mood of the one, remember he says the one man makes moods.

67
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:04,320
Let's suppose we're all in a frightened of terrorist mood.

68
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:10,160
So, out of everybody getting their private mood, somehow the public mood is constructed.

69
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:18,120
The mood in the company, I said there are business consultants, I think I said, go around finding out.

70
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,160
Did I say there are Heideggerian business consultants?

71
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,000
One of them is my PhD mind.

72
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:31,400
They make literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars going around, among other things, seeing what the mood is in a company like IBM.

73
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:40,360
And when IBM was disgruntled and depressed because they'd missed it with the PC, then they have to try to change the mood and give them an upbeat mood.

74
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,760
And yeah, maybe in trouble now, but think of the challenge kind of mood.

75
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,160
And so they're literally Heideggerian business consultants.

76
00:08:49,159 --> 00:09:09,000
And this guy, who's now a senator in Chile, maybe a candidate for president of Chile, wrote his thesis on Heidegger and passed through this business consulting stage and still has her spin-off people who give sort of Heideggerian business consulting courses.

77
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,480
But why did I get off onto that?

78
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:22,360
Because the global, yeah, there's the global mood of the one, there's the mood of the whole culture, and there's the pervasive mood in a party.

79
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:23,800
We talked about that.

80
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:31,559
And yet, all these moods sort of inside each other are atmospheres in which the whole comes first.

81
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,560
That's the ontological claim.

82
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:36,120
And people get taken over in it.

83
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:49,079
I had this argument yesterday with a bunch of mostly graduate students, I guess they were from all over, but mostly new media people who are trying to tell me that, of course, it's got to be each in each individual the mood.

84
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,600
Where else could it be?

85
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,160
And then they construct this sharedness, but that's no something called an atmosphere.

86
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:03,040
It's just can be reduced to, that's the crucial thing, the sum of these individual moods.

87
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,600
And the answers, I think, from Heidegger's point of view, ought to be not like that.

88
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:17,840
An atmosphere is like a tornado, in which you can't reduce what's going on with the tornado to the activity of all the individual drops.

89
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,080
They don't, so to speak, first come around and then add up to a tornado.

90
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:35,760
They get sort of pulled into it and governed by this whole phenomenon of the tornado, in which the drops are doing what they have to do, so to speak, to fill their heart in being part of the tornado.

91
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,680
But it's top-down.

92
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:45,920
The whole is determining, at the party, the atmosphere, if it's a gloomy party, is determining everybody's gloominess.

93
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:54,240
But it's not as if everybody sort of individually came in with their own gloominess and then stuck it all together to give thus give the atmosphere of the party.

94
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:05,040
Another way to say it when Heidegger talks about it is that the sum mood is always already there, and then you can change it to some other mood, which will then be always already there.

95
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:11,760
But you never come in as an individual from outside with your own inner story and add it up.

96
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,480
Go ahead.

97
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:21,200
Also, the sense of way you can definitely change the world, everyone's writing something.

98
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,040
That's right.

99
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:34,240
And it's interesting you should bring that up because Curtis, wherever he is, brought up the fact that Heidegger also says that you are, in effect, you should try to change the mood.

100
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,479
Maybe you can and maybe you can't because it has this global quality that it settles in.

101
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,840
The more gloomy it gets, the more and more gloomy it gets.

102
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,639
But he doesn't say you can't change it.

103
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,760
Let me see if I can find it.

104
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,760
That the bottom, in the middle of 183, I think.

105
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,559
No?

106
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,240
That's understanding.

107
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,080
No wonder it's not there.

108
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,480
It's in the middle of the right-hand side of the page, very middle.

109
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,639
It says in effect that Dasein is obliged to get control of its moods as much as possible.

110
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,799
Well, I can't find it.

111
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:30,200
But it sounds like it kind of contradicts the fact that you're always in a mood and the mood is determining you.

112
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:36,439
And that you were, as he says in the middle of 173, delivered over in your being to the mood.

113
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,960
It must be after that.

114
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,920
Just then.

115
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,120
175, that's about where I expect to find it.

116
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,319
In the middle of the page?

117
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,039
Oh, yeah.

118
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,880
Okay, factually 136 in the German.

119
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:58,439
But then factically, Dasein can, should, and must, through knowledge and will, become master of its moods in certain possible ways of existing.

120
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,640
Than so forth.

121
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:09,720
That means that you could tell a joke, or you could try to put on different music, or you could go, if you were depressed, and go exercise a lot to hope your endorphins will come and fix you.

122
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:23,399
But then he says, only we must not be misled by this into denying that ontologically mood is a primordial kind of being for Dasein, in which Dasein is disclosed prior to all cognition and volition and beyond their range.

123
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:36,879
So, what he wants to say is, yes, there are these special cases, but it's on a background of shared moods, which you can sometimes, but no guarantee, use your willpower or your wits to switch them.

124
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:39,200
Okay, let's go on.

125
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,720
So, the mood is global, and like familiarity, which is global, and moods and familiarity have a lot in common.

126
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,679
They are, remember, the background already of that on the basis of which we make sense of things.

127
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,079
That's the familiarity.

128
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:02,000
Now, we're adding the moods are the background on the basis of which things matter to us.

129
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,079
That's what moods contribute.

130
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,839
If it weren't for moods, there wouldn't be anything mattering.

131
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:16,480
So, it's when you're in a timorous mood, things matter as frightening, and when you're in an upbeat mood, things matter as opportunities, and so forth.

132
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:49,920
And he's saying that it's this background on 176 at the very bottom, toward the bottom of 137 in German, Dasein's openness to the world, the last sentence of that long paragraph, Dasein's openness to the world is constituted existentially by, then cross out the attunement of state of mind, that all the Germans better say, is Dasein's openness to the world is constituted existentially by attunement.

133
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,159
So, just and you have to, I haven't put in the mattering when I've read that yet.

134
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,839
So, now we have to put in mattering.

135
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,039
Where is it?

136
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,399
I would have thought I would have put it there, but I guess I.

137
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,359
Right.

138
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,279
Ah, okay.

139
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,200
Yes, good.

140
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,960
That's where I want, exactly.

141
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:18,440
So, he talks about the threatening character and so forth, and then he says, I guess we're going to read it all.

142
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:39,159
But to be affected by the unserviceability, restraint, so-and-so and so-and-so of what's ready to hand becomes ontologically possible only insofar as being in as such has been determined existentially beforehand in such a manner that what is encountered within the world can matter to it in this way, that is, in some way, if it means serviceable or threatening that way.

143
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:47,799
The fact that this sort of thing can matter to Dasein is grounded in its disposedness.

144
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:53,000
As a disposedness, it has already disclosed the world as something which can be threatened.

145
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,640
But then the general claim is at the bottom.

146
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:11,559
The whole world shows up as not only intelligible thanks to familiarity, but mattering thanks to your Befinlichke, your sensitivity to the matteringness of things.

147
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:17,240
There isn't any matteringness of things that you're sensitive to sort of with prior to your sensitivity.

148
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,919
Having Befinlichke just is being in a world in which things matter.

149
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,839
And things matter.

150
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:34,919
To say because of your Befinlich Kai is just to say that's how you pick up the way that things matter.

151
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,519
Okay, let's see now.

152
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:49,880
And now we have this problem, which I think somebody already brought up last time, and I said at the very end in a hurry how I would think Heidegger would deal with it.

153
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,359
But now we have to go back and worry about it.

154
00:16:52,359 --> 00:17:02,760
But there's all this business of, well, if I have my mood and you have your mood, and the world is looking gray to me and rosy to you, how can that be?

155
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,159
I mean, is the rose, is the world then really rosy, or is it really gray?

156
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,679
And you want to say, well, it can't be both, really rosy all over and gray all over.

157
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,279
That's a contradiction.

158
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:21,200
So it must be in you that it's, it must be neutral, the world.

159
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,440
And it's something you project on it that it's rosy or gray.

160
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,920
And that's what gets you into this view.

161
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:38,240
Starts with Galileo, who is the first to start saying that there's this neutral world out there that has no characteristics of a feeling sort.

162
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,039
So his example is the tickle is not in the straw, and the warmth is not in the room, I think, or something.

163
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
I wrote down this, what he said, but I don't.

164
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,000
So yeah, the tickle is not in the straw, the odor is not in the rose.

165
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:01,200
And that's meant to say it's you who project this odor on the rose or this tickle on the straw.

166
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,279
The world is neutral.

167
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,480
And now we can see why.

168
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:20,960
It could be rosy to you and gray to me because it isn't any color, and each of us can see it as if through some colored glasses, which gives us our personal, private, inner experience.

169
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,240
So let me see now where I am.

170
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:43,919
And it's better for science, of course, for Galileo and Descartes and so forth, that science doesn't have to mess with the problem of why the world or how the world looks rosy or how you get this tornado effect where there's an atmosphere that drags people in.

171
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,919
All that is just subjective.

172
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,599
That's the general word for it.

173
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,439
And it's only when it seems to be something objective that it seems something weird that you can't make any sense of.

174
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,960
If you just stick to the phenomena, it's neither subjective nor objective nor weird.

175
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,319
It's just what it is.

176
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:20,679
One of the things Dasein has is this existential structure that it lives in a world where there is this total atmosphere of mattering always, already in place by the time any person comes around and also changes with where you go.

177
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,360
And that leads to talk of projection.

178
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,199
I just did talk of projection.

179
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,279
I didn't quote the page because it's the top of 176, which I read last time already.

180
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,679
So now we've got this idea which we're going to have to try to get out of.

181
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,360
Each of us sees the world through a filter.

182
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:51,000
That would be the most, you know, what, the most comprehensible.

183
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,640
I mean, projection doesn't seem to mean anything.

184
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,279
I haven't got a colored projector where I color the world project rosy color on this neutral world and so forth.

185
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:13,079
But it's somehow, there is a neutral world, and you can have rosy-colored glasses, in which case you'll have a rosy inner experience of it, or I'll have my gray glasses and have a gray inner experience of it.

186
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:19,000
My inner world gets colored by one some way or another.

187
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,279
I just say, see page 390.

188
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:29,480
It's just another page where he happens to say something like this when he's taking up reviewing.

189
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,680
It's only, it doesn't add much, but it's clear anyway.

190
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:40,799
Middle of 390, it's in German the middle of page or the top of page 341.

191
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:49,199
We have emphasized that while moods, of course, are ontically well known to us, they are not recognized in their primordial existential function.

192
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:59,599
They are regarded as fleeting experiences which color, see, that's the phrase there, besides projection, which color one holds psychical condition.

193
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,279
So that's the colored glasses view of mood.

194
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,640
And now the question really is: but how do you understand that?

195
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:48,159
If mood isn't neutral, and the world isn't neutral, better way to put it, and you project these various colors on, or better yet, you see the world through various colored filters, how are we supposed to understand the fact that we are all somehow in the same world and attuned to the same world, and yet you can be getting a grumpy, dangerous, or whatever sense of its mattering, and somebody else can be getting this opportunity, rosy, huffbeat sense of its mattering.

196
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
How can that happen?

197
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:56,720
Well, now comes my favorite part, because I think we have to figure out how it can happen.

198
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,640
Heidegger just cops out.

199
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,000
That's such a hard question that Heidegger just tells you he's not going to even try to answer it.

200
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,919
And let me get the question clear again.

201
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:33,800
How is it that there can be a shared world which we're all attuned to, and yet this shared world could be a colored all over with what seemed to be or show up or matter in what seemed to be opposed, contradictory ways, and yet it's not going to be your subjective coloring that makes it.

202
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:47,720
So, all these ways somehow have to be in the world if we're really going to, if Buffinlikite is really going to put us in touch with the world, if our mood is going to pick up what's there, but then what's there?

203
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:56,359
If it isn't neutral, it looks like it's going to be, and I think this is the right way to go, an amazingly complicated rainbow of colors.

204
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,119
But I haven't explained that yet.

205
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,439
I just want to show you where he sort of says it's not his problem at the top of 170.

206
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,039
It should be his problem.

207
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,919
On 131 toward the bottom.

208
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,760
Without question, there are unfinished tasks still lying in this field.

209
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,240
I should say this is a pretty serious one.

210
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:23,960
What we have hitherto set forth needs to be rounded out in many ways by working out fully the existential a priori of philosophical anthropology and taking a look at it.

211
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,359
But this is not the aim of our investigation.

212
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:29,399
Its aim is one of fundamental ontology.

213
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:49,560
Well, that's right, but even fundamental ontology owes you an account of how you can, without making it subjective or projected, or using sort of filters, you can see the world as rosy and I can see the world as gray.

214
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,320
I mean, what's the kind of status of the world under those conditions?

215
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:56,680
That's, I think, a problem he has to worry about.

216
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,919
And I think he's got the making of an answer.

217
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,839
Now I'm going to switch to the issue: why does he say that moods are attunements?

218
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,599
That's the clue.

219
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:09,839
Yeah.

220
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Just to pick up on that beautiful metaphor of attunement, just imagine a group of people coming and listening to the symphonies.

221
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,959
You know, people training, right?

222
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:30,960
But that's performance about a region where moods become possible under a certain pressure.

223
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,839
Ah, which gives them all a shared mood.

224
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,639
Yes.

225
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:38,640
Yeah.

226
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:40,960
Okay.

227
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,879
I think that's right.

228
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:45,760
Okay.

229
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,480
I think, yeah.

230
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:54,399
Okay, but I think I thought you were going to go in the direction I want to go, which I'm not opposing what you say, but I want to add a problem within it.

231
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:09,279
But could you, without being insane, sit in the audience where one person is enjoying this performance and thinks that it's just so happy and upbeat and well done, and another person is sitting there listening and thinking, boy, is this a downer?

232
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,519
I wish I were home watching TV or something.

233
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:21,359
We still need to explain how it is that you can have such different reactions to the current mood.

234
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,120
Without, it always seems easy.

235
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,680
Why not?

236
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,880
It's just subjective.

237
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:28,079
But you've got to resist that.

238
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,119
How can you claim that moods tune you in on what is out there and is the case?

239
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,839
And yet, they tune you in on opposite on opposed things.

240
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,039
Well, here's my story.

241
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,080
Well, you're going to have a story?

242
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:40,399
Tell me.

243
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:41,679
That's good.

244
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,959
I don't know how it's looked like that.

245
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,960
But my body feels very healthy.

246
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,000
Everything else is okay.

247
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,360
You're wait, stop talking.

248
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:01,639
You're one you're one lecture page ahead of me.

249
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,000
I mean, wait, but just remember what you're saying.

250
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,120
But it and what you but I'll say what you're saying is something like, well, it's a kind of breakdown case.

251
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:17,480
Everybody else is enjoying a symphony, but I've got something sick, there's something wrong with me, and therefore I'm not sharing that.

252
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,200
Heidegger has something to say about that in a minute.

253
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:27,879
But I'm yet you can have an audience of normal people and they're not sick and they've all sensitive and so forth.

254
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:31,079
Well, attunement, let's talk about attunement.

255
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:40,279
Attunement means moods and let's just look at the place where he introduces attunement, because it's going to turn out to be very interesting and important, I think.

256
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:44,760
So look for on 170.

257
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,760
No, not 170.

258
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,519
1 in 72.

259
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,079
Where?

260
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,080
I mean, it's right at the beginning.

261
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,519
Bang at the very start.

262
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:07,799
So ontologically, we're talking about the the sposiness is ontically the most familiar and everyday sort of thing, our mood, our being attuned.

263
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,839
And then the footnote says, being attuned is musical.

264
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,320
That's why I thought Dave was on a track.

265
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:16,760
He's on a track, but it's not this track, I think.

266
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:27,079
The what it means then to be to be attuned is to resonate, in effect, to some particular note.

267
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:36,400
I mean, so tuning forks are attuned and and piano strings can in a crowd can pick up a certain pitch because they vibrate to that pitch.

268
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:53,200
Now, if you push that a little, it looks like our relation to the mood in the room, which is an attunement, is that we can be attuned to different aspects of this mood.

269
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:59,519
That is, it can be, I'm trying to, oh, I want to blurt this out.

270
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,279
In any situation, but let's just take this one, there is plenty of nice things to be attuned to.

271
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,559
People sitting there paying attention, not going to sleep or walking out and so forth, and to feel good about.

272
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,920
And in the same situation, there's a lot to be disgruntled about.

273
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:22,399
All those empty seats, half the room, people out listening on their iPods, or maybe worse, not listening at all.

274
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,039
I could be in a very unhappy mood about that.

275
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:34,480
So I think what Heidegger thinks is that normally you resonate to some aspect of the situation.

276
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:43,039
The mood doesn't say that the situation has only one, so to speak, be careful of this, but color.

277
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,039
Let's put the color back in the world.

278
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,639
The situation is a kind of rainbow situation.

279
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,200
That's what I thought David was saying about the symphony, and he could have been.

280
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,480
I mean, one person could be hearing, wow, is the flute good?

281
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,080
And another person could be hearing the violinist is off-pitch, and so forth.

282
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:10,640
It's a complicated, a mood is a complicated situation of a whole mixture of attune of possible attunements of um uh which various people can tune into.

283
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,560
That's what I think Heidegger thinks.

284
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,199
Yeah.

285
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:25,399
One is that I'm not sure whether that one would be a you can be assumed to a little bit quite away from it.

286
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:37,639
Yes, well so yeah that's a that's rough.

287
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,599
Well, I think not in Heidegger's sense, I think.

288
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,199
You're not resonating to it.

289
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:49,960
It's like saying a string in the piano is is not attuned to middle is attuned to middle C, even though it's not resonating to middle C.

290
00:29:49,960 --> 00:30:00,040
No, in Heidegger language I think when you're attuned to it that just means that that that is that aspect of the situation is what matters to you.

291
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,360
And I want to say something both of these are good points.

292
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:07,960
I want to and the holism I think isn't that everybody has to be in the same mood.

293
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:26,680
It's that when you're in any mood it's the atmosphere, it's the weather, so that everything is disgruntling to the disgruntled person even though in fact everything isn't disgruntling really because everything can be you know promising to the happy upbeat person.

294
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:35,959
But if it's a mood, then it's they sense it as the whole situation is such and such.

295
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,999
That's what they're let me just just repeat in a second.

296
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:41,559
Try to get the student that's what they're attuned to.

297
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:48,120
That's what they resonate to in the the in everything else in the situation they're blind to.

298
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:57,359
So, if I'm in a mood of being happy with the class and they're saying good things and paying attention and I'm saying good things and learning something, then then I am blind to the fact.

299
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:00,559
I just forget I did it every once in a while and then I remind myself.

300
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,439
I just forget all the empty seats.

301
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:10,160
But if I'm in a bad mood, no matter how smart people are and how wide awake they are, I'm worrying about the people who aren't here.

302
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,760
But that's global.

303
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,519
I mean, I'm not half attuned to the people who are here and doing well, and half attuned to the people who are absent.

304
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,959
I think Heidegger's right.

305
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:25,439
The phenomenon of mood is that whatever mood you are in, everything is in that mood.

306
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:37,200
Remember, I gave it the example: on a sunny day, everything is sunny, every day is outgoing, you can't figure out what it would be to be all muffled up and rain going down your neck and not having time to stop outside and talk to people.

307
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,159
And when it is like that, it's impossible to remember what it was like on a day like this.

308
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,159
And that's the way mood is.

309
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,799
That's the kind of totality.

310
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,440
It doesn't have to be that in a situation everybody's in the same mood.

311
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:59,760
It has to be that everybody is resonating in their own holistic way to a genuine aspect of the situation.

312
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,399
See, that's what would keep it from being inner.

313
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,400
It's not a private experience.

314
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,040
It's not something I could sort of have on my own.

315
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,840
It's a total experience of the situation.

316
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:21,600
And it really is, except when something's wrong, like we'll get to his case, if it doesn't break down, it's really picking up some aspect of the situation and it's making it total.

317
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:34,719
So you pick up on the opportunities in the situation, and then if you're in the upbeat mood, and you pick up in the annoying thing in the situation, if you're in the annoyed mood, and they are both really there, that's what I want to keep repeating.

318
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,519
The situation really is that.

319
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:43,439
And what makes it annoying is simply, so to speak, up to a point, you're taking it as annoying.

320
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:48,520
It isn't something the situation has, even if you took Dasein out of the universe.

321
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,760
But there's a lot of ways of responding to the objective.

322
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:58,360
I don't know, of course, that word is just, you shouldn't be in there, but I have to put it in there and then take it away.

323
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:20,120
There are lots of different, so to speak, valid ways of responding to the objective mood in the room or the situation, and you each are resonating to one of them, just the way the string in the piano can pick out from all the notes that the symphony is playing one note and resonate to that.

324
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,319
Only add the fact that it couldn't, and once it does, it's not going to be easy for it to pick out any other being.

325
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,640
Okay, somebody started to have a hand up.

326
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,519
Tyler, yeah.

327
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:37,079
Like the spirit state is a little bit changed to account for the differences in different perspectives and multiplication.

328
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:51,080
It seems to be infinite importance to retain the both for something to a shared region, having many differences.

329
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,120
Yeah.

330
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,799
That's important.

331
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:56,920
Having found different ways of keeping the same way.

332
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,119
Okay, well, I mean, I that would just, I mean, that could cut two ways.

333
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:11,880
Do you mean that you come from different places, but now you're in a, you know, where you're at, you're in a shared disposiveness where you're all tuned the same way?

334
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:19,879
Or are you trying to answer the question, how come people are tuned in many different ways, even though they're in the same general situation?

335
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,559
I think that's what you're trying to answer.

336
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,279
That's orthogonal or something to my question.

337
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:28,680
I mean, there are two questions at least.

338
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,760
I mean, Heidegger's brushing them all off.

339
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:45,760
My question is: how can you got here, how can different people be picking up and resonating to and having a mood that's different about this and picking up different aspects of the situation?

340
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,160
And you're telling me, well, they came from different places.

341
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,480
I don't, I mean, that doesn't help me.

342
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:58,319
I want to know how this situation can be publicly instead of private.

343
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:07,279
And publicly, it can be rosy and gray and threatening and soothing and so forth.

344
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:22,560
How could that same situation be all that, which is phenomenally, phenomenologically true, without relapsing into, well, the real situation is neutral and different people are projecting different private stuff on it?

345
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,839
And I don't see any answer.

346
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,480
Maybe the great paper topic, because Heidegger doesn't tell us, but the phenomena is there to consider.

347
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:46,720
I'm saying I think Heidegger's committed to something like you could call the rich reality view, that the world is very rich and complex, and there are all sorts of different ways of holistically resonating to a particular situation.

348
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,160
And they're all, and the important thing to say is something like they're all true.

349
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,639
I mean, there is a disgruntling situation in this room right now with all those empty seats.

350
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,240
And it is a terrifically happy situation because the people who are here are making a contribution.

351
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:07,279
And that's not something you have to uh deny.

352
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:19,159
All you have to say is, and some people are resonating to one and some to the other, and somebody like me may be flipping back and forth for a while, uh, though mostly I forget the empty seats.

353
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:35,480
Uh so yeah, situations that wait, they would have to be able to know essentially are in those situations when they're moved.

354
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:36,200
Definitely.

355
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:50,200
We come into a situation somehow or other one who assumes ourselves with all powerful different that's right.

356
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,560
That's right, right, right, that's right.

357
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,559
But and so what?

358
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,319
I mean, some of them can be wrong.

359
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:58,999
That is, you'll have to give up.

360
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:04,040
You if you stick to it, now let's go on though from where you are to what hit his point.

361
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:15,240
I mean, if you come in into a situation in which everybody is having a good time, and you've been in a bad situation and you're in a bad mood, there are two possibilities.

362
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,359
You're attuned to the really bad aspects of the situation, and there usually really are.

363
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:29,080
Maybe people have been drinking too much, or maybe it's past time for them to be home in bed, or who knows what.

364
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:39,880
But you could be attuned all by yourself to a realistic, disgruntling aspect, resonate to that aspect of the situation.

365
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:42,600
That would be, in my reading, okay.

366
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,839
Parties are rich realities, and there's always good things and bad things going on at parties.

367
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:47,640
Wait a second.

368
00:37:47,640 --> 00:38:07,279
But you could, and this is where I'm taking up from you and from him, really be some kind of psychopathology, that no matter what goes on in the party, no matter the fact that you came from this other mood, you're just stuck in it and you're and you bring it to you to every party you go to.

369
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:12,720
Remember, Heidegger's example is there are some people who just bring in bad moods all the time.

370
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:18,159
It's bad to refer to Heidegger's example because I don't think Heidegger means that as a breakdown.

371
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,919
But I mean it's a breakdown.

372
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,080
There are people who are stuck in moods that don't correspond.

373
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,120
And this is important now.

374
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:27,920
I'm going to make a dangerous move.

375
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:36,720
They're in a mood which doesn't correspond, doesn't resonate to, doesn't pick up any aspect of the current situation.

376
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,200
Because they're just angry, and there's nothing to be angry about, and they're angry in every situation.

377
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,360
It must be inner.

378
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,200
It must be subjective.

379
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,520
It's just their private anger.

380
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,680
And oddly enough, I hope you're following me.

381
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,360
I want to say right.

382
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,359
And Heidegger would say yes.

383
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,279
And that's why is that a typical Heidegger move?

384
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:04,080
Because he's always got to explain the kind of Cartesian intuition.

385
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,520
He's going to say always that the Cartesian intuition is a breakdown, but it really can happen.

386
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:20,160
It can really happen where your mood gets to be subjective and private and out of sync with anything that anybody else could is resonating to.

387
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:27,200
Now, have I said something that oh wait, wait, no, I said to him, him, yeah, that I would put him on hold.

388
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,960
You're you sure?

389
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:29,919
You're okay?

390
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:30,720
Okay?

391
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:42,719
Why does Heidegger make it possessive by saying every case it's there?

392
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,959
Why is it why does he say it's the there?

393
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:59,799
I'm not sure I get your question, but I can I can give an interesting answer anyway to some question.

394
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:02,920
I mean they remember that there are two meanings to the there.

395
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:05,240
And we talked about that last time.

396
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:23,240
So if if the there means that it's where you are, so there I am in the front of the room and there you are in the back of the room, that's one thing, and the mood is going to tell you that, the sort of it's going to reveal your perspective on it, you're resonating.

397
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:28,360
And there's the there, there we were at the lecture, and the mood's going to reveal that too.

398
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,240
That's the sense of the whole, what's the mood in the room?

399
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:45,400
And you got your own slant on the mood in the room, which is this very rich mixture of stuff out of which you resonate re resonate to some something, some part of it.

400
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,119
Are you happy with the breakdown story that I've taken it over?

401
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,159
Let me situate it and then you'll see if you're happy with it.

402
00:40:53,319 --> 00:41:00,279
I'm gonna because I jumped ahead, pushed by whoa, the fact that we've got five minutes, so let me jump really ahead.

403
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:03,639
So yeah, I've done all that, I've done all that.

404
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,520
Yes, perfect.

405
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:10,440
So we need to account for the Cartesian sense that moods are private and inner.

406
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,399
Because I think Heidi was absolutely right.

407
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:27,319
He will just sound crazy because people will tell you that they were once at a party in which everybody was happy and there was every reason to be happy, and they were just sitting there as angry, and nothing can happened that should make them angry that they were still in some other situation.

408
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:28,359
They're just sick.

409
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,959
They better go to a therapist.

410
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:30,919
That's okay.

411
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,799
That's a breakdown.

412
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:35,919
And it's just like the other minds breakdown.

413
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:36,720
That's what you should see.

414
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:53,040
When it comes to the Cartesian question, how come there's a problem of other minds if we're all intracorporeally picking up on each other's mental states openly because being with is a very basic way we are with other people?

415
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:03,999
Remember, Heidegger's answer is on 161 and that people hide what they're thinking and have secret motives and so forth.

416
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,760
For instance, at the bottom, no, not the bottom, 161.

417
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:23,120
Well, he wants to say, how do we explain at the bottom of 161, explain the theoretical problem of understanding the psychic life of others?

418
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,520
Why should there even be such a problem?

419
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:31,680
And it turns out that people have problems for each other.

420
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,440
They have at the bottom of 162 unsociable modes of being with.

421
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,959
They're sort of hiding things from each other.

422
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:43,040
It doesn't matter how you spell it out.

423
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:49,440
And now we've got the parallel thing in the in, well, let me see.

424
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,720
Yeah, okay, I want to get to the punchline.

425
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
So he does the parallel thing with mood.

426
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,879
He says, or he doesn't.

427
00:42:58,879 --> 00:42:59,359
He could.

428
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,720
I'm constructing him.

429
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:12,079
I think he should say that just as there really are breakdowns in communication and really a problem of other minds, so moods can really be private.

430
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,519
You can have your own phobias.

431
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:21,319
You can find everything frightening and threatening, even though there doesn't seem to be any basis for it at all.

432
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:33,240
And the moral is supposed to be, and that's what I wanted to say before time runs out: the mistake from a Heideggerian point of view, I think, is never.

433
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:49,160
The mistake is to deny the phenomenon that somebody like Descartes was on to, that there can be private secret things, so that there is a problem of other minds, an ontic problem of other minds.

434
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:57,720
There can be people who are resonating to something which is just not there to resonate, even in the richest world and the richest party.

435
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,360
They got private problems.

436
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:01,799
Now comes the crucial thing.

437
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:13,160
What the philosophical mistake, and it's so amazing how easy it is to make it, is to say, but that's these breakdown cases reveal what is really there all along, but you didn't notice it.

438
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,359
That's what they were telling me yesterday, the people who are trying to make the moods go back into the individuals.

439
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:32,520
You say, yeah, of course it looks like it's a shared atmosphere, but then there are these people who are all out of touch with it, and they're revealing the fact that really it's private in everyone, and that it's just a kind of coincidence that they're all fitted together.

440
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,640
And the move is a simple move.

441
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:44,920
Just think that the breakdown reveals what was there all along, and you're off into Cartesianism.

442
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:59,480
And all that Heidegger needs to do is to say that each time you do this to him, yes, of course, there are pathologies in which people have completely private moods, and we have to treat those people.

443
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:08,640
But you mustn't let that convince you that the ontology of moods is not the only thing that they're private, subjective, projected experiences.

444
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:21,119
The ontology of moods is that they're shared atmospheres, which people get resonate to, and there can be breakdowns in which they're not resonating to anything.

445
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,120
They're just having some debris in their minds.

446
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,639
Okay, I have to run out.

447
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,519
It's noon.

448
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,920
So see you next Thursday.
