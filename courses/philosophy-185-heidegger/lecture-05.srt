1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,601
So I'm just going to go right back to talking about what we're talking about.

2
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:21,200
I think, I don't know how far I'm going to get today, but I think today will be relatively straightforward and easy, as I keep warning you, and you must have discovered if you've done the reading for this week, it gets extremely hard and complicated toward the end of the assignment.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:28,400
If I can get enough of the phenomena out on the table today, then I can explain those abstract things.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,320
Heidegger is always understandable.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:45,040
Maybe I should just give you this principle for how to read it, as far as I can see, is what you go along reading Heidegger, and it seems to be pointing to some phenomenon, but it's pretty hard and so forth.

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:55,960
Then if you can get the phenomena that he's talking about, which is what we've been doing, like the phenomena, the simple phenomena of using equipment and how that works.

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:06,920
Then you can go back and understand the more weird things like the in order to's and tors witches and for the sake of witches, all have seemed like too much jargon.

8
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:07,960
They all map nicely.

9
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:11,721
That's what I'm going to do today onto the Heidegger.

10
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,001
And then you go back and forth.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,361
Well, thanks to understanding the Heidegger, you can understand more precisely what the phenomena is talking about.

12
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:24,840
And the more you understand precisely what the phenomena is, you can understand more and more clearly what he's saying.

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:35,321
And he says in one place, I wasn't expecting to make this speech, so I didn't look it up, but he says in one of his lecture courses, but the phenomena first, always the phenomena.

14
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,121
That's the thing to remember with Heidegger.

15
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:44,600
That's what makes him interesting and different and in an odd sense easier than anybody else.

16
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:46,120
So here we go.

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,320
We've done the phenomenon of the kinds of being already.

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,601
And that is the two big three big kinds: the present at hand, ready-to-hand, and Dasein.

19
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:07,560
Now we have to add a more shaky one, shaky only in the sense that Heidegger's not very clear about it himself, but it's very important.

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,720
And it's always around in the book, but it doesn't get thematized very much.

21
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,721
And that's the unready to hand.

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,400
And then we have to talk about how they relate to each other.

23
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,960
All these various ways of being that we've been talking about.

24
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,200
That's the main project for today.

25
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:47,001
Or one more version, two more versions of the project for today would be, and it's trying to give you the structure of worldhood, just what Wittgenstein said you couldn't do, that there is a structure in the hurly-burly of everyday activity, and he's going to find it.

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:03:40,161
And another project, which I've mentioned, but is going to get more and more central over today and next time, and that is to destroy the distinction between subjects and objects and between self and world, so that if you understand Heidegger and the phenomena, you won't be able to even understand anymore what people were ever talking about when they talked about, for instance, proofs of the existence of the external world, because he's going to show there's no internal, no, no internal, external distinction, no subject-object distinction, no self-world distinction can stand up to a description of the phenomena that has freed itself from 2,000 years of tradition, making this distinction with all sorts of variations.

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,361
And now we'll just plunge in and do all those things.

28
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,440
They'll take the next few lectures.

29
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:53,440
So, starting with unreadiness to hand, that's where we were last time at the end.

30
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:05,440
And it really is a sort of a mess because he doesn't focus on it and he doesn't distinguish it clearly enough from the present to hand.

31
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:17,200
He says a sentence which makes my hair stand on end on the top of 103.

32
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:21,281
There's a kind of presence at hand, he says, about 10 lines down.

33
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,840
The presence at hand of something that cannot be used is still not devoid of all readiness to hand whatsoever.

34
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:32,161
Equipment which is present at hand in this way is still not just a thing which occurs.

35
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:55,161
All that's true, but it's sort of weird to be trying to explain this special mode of being, which is unreadiness to hand, which is the way you experience things whenever they are either, not only when they're not working, but when you're learning a new skill, when you're, as he says in a passage I'll read, when you're inspecting things and so forth.

36
00:04:55,161 --> 00:05:12,120
There's a whole mode of being which isn't transparent and withdrawn like the ready-to-hand, and it isn't just in a context deworlded way sitting there with properties like the present at hand.

37
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,200
And he should just say, and boy, oh boy, look at that, another mode of being, the unready to hand.

38
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,081
But he doesn't.

39
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:23,960
He sort of tries to make it somehow a special feature of the present at hand.

40
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:25,881
I mean, don't worry about that sentence.

41
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,601
I mean, you can worry about it if you want to, but I don't recommend it.

42
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:35,401
I think it's better to try to fix him in this case than to try to figure out what in the world he has in mind.

43
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:46,760
We can see what he has in mind if you look at the bottom of 102, which is 73 in the German, when he talks about conspicuousness.

44
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,600
I mean, that's the phenomenon.

45
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:53,960
Conspicuousness presents the ready-to-hand equipment in a certain unreadiness to hand.

46
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:56,281
That's the right thing to say.

47
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:06,281
And then we can begin to describe what it is like, this unreadiness to hand.

48
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:19,120
And then he describes three modes of disturbance, where disturbance doesn't necessarily mean, as I used to think, breakdown or malfunction.

49
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:31,281
Disturbance just means anything that stops the transparent, ongoing coping that you normally just have.

50
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:35,201
Ongoing is a dewy phrase, but it fits this perfectly.

51
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:43,361
Everyday readiness to hand, when it's working, when it's withdrawn, is just going on and nothing interrupts it.

52
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:50,801
Heidegger uses the same phrase somewhere, but as I say, every time I start saying things I wasn't going to say, I can't give you the pages.

53
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,840
When I come across it again, I'll read it.

54
00:06:53,841 --> 00:07:10,960
But the main point is that there is a mode of experiencing equipment which isn't transparent, ongoing, absorbed coping, and it doesn't necessarily have to be breakdown either.

55
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:25,041
But it is a hard to find a word for it, but I call it disturbance only because something comes along which disturbs the ongoing, unproblematic, skillful coping.

56
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:39,041
And it could be, Heidegger has three kinds, conspicuousness, and then he also mentions, what is it, the obtrusiveness, because I decided I only wanted to talk about conspicuousness, but now I'm talking about all three.

57
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,041
Help me find the third one.

58
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,441
What's obstinacy, right?

59
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:49,281
These are sort of progressively holding up of what you're doing.

60
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:57,601
Conspicuousness is the interesting one to me because that's the main one that you have a lot of the time and plays a big role.

61
00:07:57,601 --> 00:08:06,440
The other ones are when things are really breaking down and something is either not functioning at all or something is in the way of something else.

62
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:07,641
I really want to talk about them.

63
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,681
I'm happy to talk about conspicuousness and you can do the rest.

64
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:23,321
Now, conspicuousness can occur when something isn't functioning as well as it should be.

65
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:25,481
That is, you can see that best.

66
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:29,241
It's sort of scattered all over being in time, and I'll just have to help you find it.

67
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:34,841
On 409 is a very important place where he's talking about this.

68
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,841
409?

69
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,321
So it says, let's see.

70
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,361
Oh, yeah, that's a little sort of throwaway phrase, but it's important.

71
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,841
This is German 358.

72
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:52,201
It's important to see that it's not breakdown.

73
00:08:52,201 --> 00:09:13,721
He says, on the contrary, never mind what the contrary is, the tarrying, which is a funny word, but that means sort of coping with things, but not ongoingly, the tarrying that results from a discontinuance, this is my translation, of one's manipulation.

74
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:23,160
You better fix that, which is that because it's all wrong here, and you couldn't understand what it meant if you read it tearing, which is discontinued when one manipulates.

75
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:35,641
No, it's the tearing that results, that you'll get held up, flowed up, from the discontinuance of your ongoing manipulation.

76
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:51,521
That can take the character of a more precise kind of circumspection, such as now we get these positive ways of paying attention to what's going on that's not transparent, but is not a breakdown either.

77
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:59,201
Such as inspecting, checking up on what's been attained, or looking over the operations that are now at a standstill.

78
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:05,841
But not as a standstill because anything broke down, but it's the end of the day, presumably.

79
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:12,561
And you can add another important one, it seems to be, which is when you're learning some new skill.

80
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:19,041
Then you've got to pay attention to what you're dealing with and how to deal with it.

81
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,441
And that's conspicuousness.

82
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:24,160
And it's not a breakdown or a malfunction.

83
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,241
It's hard, not even really a disturbance.

84
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:30,321
It's just a mode of being that you have to go, you need sometimes.

85
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:30,961
Yeah.

86
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,120
If you like for a bartend, it was important there too.

87
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:42,880
Okay, that's when everything's at a standstill.

88
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,081
It's the end of the day.

89
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:45,201
You pay attention.

90
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:53,841
I mean, I think of that, maybe if you were a bartender that was really good at it and had done it a long time, all sort of with transparently.

91
00:10:53,841 --> 00:11:00,401
I mean, it's not clear that you have to pay much attention to collect all the glasses and polish them and put them back on the shelf.

92
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:08,481
If you do, then I think you're just learning the skill and not really a full-fledged coper yet.

93
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,001
Anything else?

94
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,361
Okay, let's let me.

95
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:14,561
So learning is another important one.

96
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,881
Or having, and it's sort of like learning, dealing with a new piece of equipment.

97
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
I mean, sort of a little different, but not much.

98
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:31,680
I mean, you can be learning to ride a bicycle, or you could be dealing with a multi-gear bicycle when you only had been riding a non-gear bicycle.

99
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,881
All that would be conspicuousness.

100
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:47,001
And what's important, why it's important, that this is a special, interesting way of being that Heidegger doesn't shout enough, is that what shows up then?

101
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:50,920
I mean, it can't be that nothing shows up, that would be withdrawn.

102
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,321
That would be exactly what should happen if you're really coping well.

103
00:11:55,321 --> 00:12:01,401
And it can't be that substance and properties show up, because that would mean that you'd sort of be given up altogether.

104
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,280
That's what happens when you've lost something that you were trying to work with, or the hammer can't be found, or something's in the way, and you can't reach the hammer.

105
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:12,761
Heidegger has those are the obstinacy, and what was the other one again?

106
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:15,001
I keep forgetting.

107
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,801
What?

108
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:17,481
Obtrusiveness.

109
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,281
Obtrusiveness.

110
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:29,401
But it can't, those are so far gone that you're just staring at things and looking at their properties.

111
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,081
Then they're present at hand.

112
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:36,841
But conspicuousness, particularly, the other ones can probably be like that too, but it doesn't matter.

113
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:47,961
Conspicuousness must reveal things in its own unique way, not as invisible, so to speak, and not as substances with properties.

114
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:54,601
And Heidegger knows that, and he mentions it, but way back on page 412.

115
00:12:55,081 --> 00:13:05,161
Most of the interesting things about all this happen on page 412, which since we're never going to get to the second apart division two in this course, we better just look at that paragraph now.

116
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,161
Hammering comes back.

117
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:12,120
It comes back in a context which is not relevant right now.

118
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,521
Namely, he's going to derive a theoretical attitude and what shows up in a theoretical attitude.

119
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:29,041
But he's going to get there starting with coping and starting with something that's conspicuous because it's not coping well.

120
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:43,521
So at the second paragraph on 412, which is 358 in the German, when we are using a tool circumspectively, we can say, for instance, that the hammer is too heavy or too light.

121
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:50,880
Even the, what is utterance, I want to say, that, I mean, it couldn't be, the proposition is irrelevant.

122
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:59,921
I mean, even the utterance that the hammer is heavy can give expression to, see, propositions don't give expression, I don't think, but it doesn't matter if we're doing.

123
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:09,841
Even the utterance that the hammer is heavy can give expression to a concernful deliberation and signify that the hammering is not easy.

124
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:12,081
I'm changing it a little.

125
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:18,161
In other words, that it takes force to handle it, that it will be hard to manipulate.

126
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,401
Okay, stop with that.

127
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,841
What that is, so what shows up?

128
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:27,681
Namely, that the hammer is too heavy.

129
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:34,001
And that's a very interesting something or other, because it's not a property.

130
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,361
A property of the hammer, like it was brown, it would have in any situation.

131
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:49,760
You just, it's lying around brown and you drop it onto the people, the bushmen in the gods must be crazy, and it's still brown, and that's what properties are.

132
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:58,640
They're permanently in here in substances, all of course, relatively permanent.

133
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,561
Substance can be disintegrated, and you can paint them out of colors, but that doesn't matter.

134
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:08,280
Properties are these fixed features of substances.

135
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,441
Well, what is too heavy?

136
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:14,601
Well, Heidegger doesn't have a name for it, but I'm going to call it an aspect.

137
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:24,441
An aspect is defined by being situational and relative to some task.

138
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:26,680
So the hammer isn't just too heavy.

139
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:29,161
It wouldn't be too heavy orbiting the Earth.

140
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:40,521
It's too heavy for me, for this job, or these kind of nails, or this kind of wood, and it may be, or maybe it's not always too heavy for me, but I'm tired.

141
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,081
And you can make up anything you want.

142
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:47,801
The important thing is that too heavy is not a feature of the hammer.

143
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:58,761
It's a feature of something that you can say about the hammer in a context relevant to a use.

144
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:13,000
And that's fascinating because that means that there's a whole area of something or others that the tradition has never had a name for and that you wouldn't be able to deal with in a predicate calculus because too heavy isn't a predicate.

145
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,241
A predicate names a property.

146
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:29,320
So, and it isn't a feature either, because a feature names some anomalies some detached, some isolable few or something in cognitive psychology.

147
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,640
It's an aspect is this funny holistic something or other.

148
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:42,680
And Heidegger should have been happy to have discovered the importance of that because he's very interested in holism all the time.

149
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:52,400
And this is one kind of holism, that things have properties which you can't define in isolation from the thing and from the situation.

150
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:53,600
Yes.

151
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,961
Well, I don't know.

152
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
What is a secondary property?

153
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,881
Oh, I see.

154
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:08,241
Ah, now I got it.

155
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:11,600
Yes, it doesn't, but I admit it's interesting why.

156
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
He's thinking, you're thinking, I believe.

157
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,721
Yes, of course, color could be relative to me.

158
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:20,800
Somebody with something with a different visual system wouldn't see the color.

159
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,080
But in the everyday world, I mean, that's too far off scientific and not phenomenological enough.

160
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:36,160
Color is definitely a property, and it doesn't show itself, so to speak, as depending on your visual system.

161
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:40,481
And so secondary properties, rightly named, I think, are still properties.

162
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:46,640
They're properties which, from a theoretical point of view, are not self-sufficient.

163
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:53,441
But that's we may turn out to be wrong about color, but phenomenologically, it's going to just be a property anyway.

164
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah.

165
00:17:58,481 --> 00:17:59,760
What's that?

166
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:01,680
Oh, really?

167
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,201
Well, let's do something about that.

168
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:06,320
I'm glad you said I just don't don't sound loud enough back there.

169
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,520
Is that the problem?

170
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,600
Okay, I'll sound louder if I could.

171
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:16,560
Maybe help, Dave, I can't.

172
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,241
Okay, go ahead, Chris.

173
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:25,201
Wait a second.

174
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,000
He wants to.

175
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:30,160
Yeah, well that's what I was trying to do, but he's he removed it down toward the music.

176
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,281
Well, let's let's see what we do here.

177
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,041
But I'm glad somebody spoke up.

178
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,920
I don't.

179
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:35,721
Okay, now.

180
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:36,600
You think I am?

181
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,120
Am I louder now?

182
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:39,560
Good enough?

183
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:40,600
Okay.

184
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:45,080
Tell me if it turns out not to be working for you.

185
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,520
Now, go ahead.

186
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,400
Yeah?

187
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,600
Yeah.

188
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:49,241
Okay.

189
00:18:49,481 --> 00:19:00,600
Well, page 101 points out why present things doesn't exist and why the idea of the secondary is properties then.

190
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:12,920
If it was why that it was handled by the handle priority, we just want to but that's wrong.

191
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:15,961
But I mean, the wrong of Heidegger.

192
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:19,000
No.

193
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:20,280
Wait a minute.

194
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,640
I mean, that's bad.

195
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:25,881
Okay, well, that's only because he's used the word aspect.

196
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:32,360
I mean, but anyway, it's he's he may not want to call it an aspect because this is on 101.

197
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,201
I know he uses aspect in his own way, and it's probably not going to work with my way.

198
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,601
But I'm not attached to aspect.

199
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,040
I just don't have any other name for this.

200
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,560
But let's see his use of aspect.

201
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,920
I mean, his use of aspect.

202
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,961
I'm not disagreeing.

203
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:47,241
Chris, right?

204
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:48,921
Furgis, I knew it wasn't quite right.

205
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,401
I'm disagreeing with Curtis only about what word to use.

206
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,681
But let's worry about that.

207
00:19:56,681 --> 00:20:04,201
The kind of being that belongs to these entities is readiness to hand, but this character is not understood merely as a way of taking them, as if we were talking some aspect of the entities.

208
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,080
Ah, yeah.

209
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,921
In quotes, no, you notice.

210
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:21,281
And what he means there is if you use aspect that way, he's saying, well, you don't just take present-at-hand entities and give them functions and assign them functions.

211
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,920
We're going to talk about that precisely next Tuesday.

212
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:30,080
That's the issue he's got with Descartes and John Searle.

213
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:32,400
But it's not this.

214
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:38,000
But I'm glad you brought it up because if that, I don't know another better word, so I'm going to take the word away from him.

215
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:39,760
It is not a technical term for him.

216
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,601
It's just a little quote word.

217
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:49,201
It says it's not how it's to be understood.

218
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:50,800
That's a presentation.

219
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,921
Well, I'm not convinced that that's maybe.

220
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,841
You think it's used as present-at-hand?

221
00:20:56,401 --> 00:21:00,640
I guess the question is, do you think he doesn't have a presentation by presenting?

222
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,121
No, I mean, did he ask me?

223
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:08,880
I don't think he uses aspects in a revised way, because I don't think aspects have any clear meaning.

224
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:18,241
In the tradition, it's not a term that's got a present-at-hand meaning or ready or unready-to-hand meaning, and he doesn't bother to give it.

225
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:19,680
I mean, that's my complaint.

226
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:28,800
He doesn't have to, I mean, I don't care what word he uses, but he better find a word that the tradition hasn't taken over and made into a property or make up one.

227
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,161
He's good at making up words.

228
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:33,201
Why doesn't he make up one for the too heavy?

229
00:21:33,201 --> 00:21:36,880
Whatever, and the too heavy, you know, is all over the place.

230
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:40,961
I mean, things are either too bright and too hard and too easy.

231
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:51,280
And that's just one subset of all the ways that things can become conspicuous.

232
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:59,520
I think that's a good word, and not just transparent, but go on coping, go on functioning.

233
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:02,520
That's the hammer being too heavy, is just an example.

234
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,880
Did I see a hand up there?

235
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,760
Yeah, Tyler.

236
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes, that's exactly what Curtis is saying, too.

237
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,921
But is that a traditional use of the word aspect?

238
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:34,520
I never came across the word aspect except in Wittgenstein, where it's in fact used in a Heidegger way, where when you have a Gestalt switch, he says that you can see the same figure under two aspects.

239
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,201
That's good.

240
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:43,081
And I think Heidegger and Wittgenstein are onto something, but Heidegger hasn't got a word for it, and Wittgenstein calls it aspect.

241
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,241
And I think aspect is up for grabs.

242
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:48,361
I don't think it's a traditional word for property.

243
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,280
But let's not go any further in it.

244
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,840
As long as you've got the phenomena, remember, back to the phenomena, and there's nothing mysterious about it.

245
00:22:55,161 --> 00:23:00,520
And let's just agree so we understand each other in our papers or reading each other and so forth.

246
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:11,401
We're going to call, we're going to take over the word aspect from Heidegger and use it to describe the situational characteristics of things.

247
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,800
I'm just trying to avoid the word property.

248
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:23,320
Characteristic may be, I just invented it, a blanket term that's going to cover aspects the way I'm using it and properties.

249
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,120
They're both something that a hammer can have.

250
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:31,560
Now, I didn't expect that to be such a big deal.

251
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,881
I mean, it is a big deal, but the name for it is not supposed to be a big deal.

252
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:45,160
It's a holistic something or other of a hammer, or of anything that's functioning, but not very well.

253
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:54,400
Or that you're learning to use, remember, I've got to go back over the big list again because I'm falling into the fact that the hammer happens to not be functioning very well in Heidegger's example.

254
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:57,361
But if you were inspecting things, they would have aspects.

255
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,520
I mean, the job was really well done or sloppy, those are aspects.

256
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,441
I mean, floppy, given what you expected and what you wanted and what the situation requires.

257
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:11,600
If you were, what are the other list of things?

258
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:18,560
If you were learning things, they could be too hard or too simple and so forth.

259
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,160
Whenever, it doesn't have to be something not working.

260
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:28,961
Whenever you're in the unready-to-hand business, then you're in the aspect business.

261
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:40,481
And I also think that there's some, and this is something just on the side for those who had any Husserl or Searle.

262
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:44,320
I think they are in the aspect business sometimes.

263
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,920
I think that when you get aspects, you get some.

264
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,601
No, I don't want to talk about that.

265
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,081
Sorry.

266
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,120
If I do, it'll just confuse you and interrupt what I want to talk about.

267
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:08,080
So let's go on to the changeover to the present at hand, because we're on page 412, and that's where we should be staying and not wandering off.

268
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:19,680
Because that brilliant paragraph, which I'll come back to again much later in the book when we get to science and theory, but let's just go on a little.

269
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:35,961
Uh the entity is, but this proposition, this utterance, the the name of the hammer is too heavy, can also mean that the entity before us, which is already known circumspectively as a hammer, has a weight.

270
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:39,160
That is to say it has the property heaviness.

271
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,481
So you see he's got the word property right.

272
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:46,040
He just doesn't have any name for which what what what the heaviness is.

273
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,040
But uh he and what has happened when you've made that switch over?

274
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:55,721
Well, you've now gotten to the point where you're describing it in a way that you have uh that it's always got.

275
00:25:55,721 --> 00:26:00,441
It exerts a pressure on what lies beneath it, and it falls when that's removed.

276
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:22,520
When this kind of talk is so understood, is no longer spoken within the horizon of awaiting and retaining of equipment, never mind awaiting and retaining, that's technical division two talk, but in the horizon of using equipment, and equipmental totality and its involvement relations, then you're in you're in the the present at hand.

277
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,080
And you can make one more switch over, just so you see the whole picture.

278
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,881
There are two kinds of present at hand.

279
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,721
Heidegger knows there are.

280
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:33,241
He sees the phenomena.

281
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:35,320
He hasn't got a good name for them either.

282
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,961
But there is, I want to I'll name them.

283
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:39,400
There's substance.

284
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:44,040
And you've already got to the substance when you've got an object that has the property of heaviness.

285
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:52,600
But w you can get it even more that's already desituated because it has it all anywhere.

286
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,560
But you can then just totally deworld it.

287
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,320
And Heidegger talks about how science deworlds things.

288
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,441
That means take it out of all reference to us and to anything else.

289
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:08,201
And then you could say the hammer has mass, he goes on.

290
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:11,160
We are looking at something with mass.

291
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:17,520
You cite something that is suitable for the hammer, not as a tool, but a but a corporeal thing.

292
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:21,361
So you get to the corporeal thing subject to the law of gravity.

293
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,921
To talk circumspectively of too heavy or too light no longer has any meaning.

294
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:28,880
I mean in science nothing is too heavy or too light.

295
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:32,800
Electrons have a certain weight, but they're never too heavy or too light.

296
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,880
They just have it in a deworlded way.

297
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:45,600
So the entity in itself, as we now encounter it, gives us nothing with relation to which it could be found if too heavy or too light.

298
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:55,840
We've switched over, as he says at the bottom of the page, changed over to, in fact, the scientific way of thinking about things.

299
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,160
Okay.

300
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,560
Now comes a much, I mean, that was supposed to be just easy to get out of the way.

301
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:20,481
The interesting question arises: once you made all these distinctions, you want to ask yourself, now we've got all the modes of being on the table.

302
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,361
We just added the unready to hand mode of being.

303
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,361
And I just caution you, Heidegger never calls the unready to hand a mode of being.

304
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,400
That's me.

305
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:31,120
I do it in my commentary unwittingly.

306
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:32,641
I attribute it to Heidegger.

307
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:44,080
But I've been beat on by various smart students and TAs who point out there isn't any place in being in time where Heidegger says that the unready to hand is a mode of being, but I say, but he should.

308
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,600
And he knows there is the phenomena, and it is a mode of being.

309
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,441
He just hasn't said it.

310
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:49,841
Okay.

311
00:28:50,161 --> 00:29:00,961
Now, the interesting question is: once we've got all these modes of being, we want to understand something, and now we can put the unready-to-hand out of the story.

312
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:03,481
And that's one reason why he never has focused on it.

313
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,361
It's not the big deal issue that interests him.

314
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:29,961
The big deal issue that interests him, that comes out of the tradition, is how to relate the present-at-hand, the traditional understanding of being of entities, to the ready-to-hand, the Heidegger understanding of the being of equipment, and ask the question, the ontological question, which has a priority?

315
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:48,600
The substances with their properties, which is ontologically basic, the substances with their properties, onto which you somehow have to add a function predicate now and then, or the whole world of functioning equipment.

316
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,360
That's a big deal, hard, interesting question.

317
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,680
Which, in the Heidegger jargon, which he gets from phenomenology, which founds which?

318
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,320
And you want to say, come on, Heidegger, now you have to make up your mind and make an argument for which way.

319
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,120
You obviously can't have it both ways.

320
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:17,961
And the answer is, from Heidegger's point of view, as I understand it, I'm sort of constructing this a little clearer than it is here in Heidegger, and maybe I'm wrong.

321
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:35,800
But I think Heidegger's answer is it's a philosophical assumption or prejudice or something that you've got to settle this question as if there was only one kind of founding and you've got to decide which founds which in that kind.

322
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:42,000
But I think Heidegger wants to say that there are two kinds of founding, and they each found the other.

323
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,681
And there's, and just stick to the phenomena again.

324
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,600
What goes on?

325
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:53,041
Well, he says that the present at hand underlies the ready-to-hand on 101.

326
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:57,121
He says it is a rhetorical question, but I think he really believes it.

327
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,400
He says, and this crucial passage is all about this.

328
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:07,040
So right after the aspect passage.

329
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:16,241
And he's talking about the people who think that there are brute facts to talk like John Searle, and then we give them function properties.

330
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,641
And he's saying that's not so.

331
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:29,121
And now he's going to try to say, he's going, he claims, oh, it's complicated, huh?

332
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,441
Well, I'm going to just blurt it out and then we'll read the passage.

333
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:41,680
What I think he holds is that causally the present at hand underlies and founds the ready-to-hand.

334
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,360
He better hold that.

335
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,041
That means that you can't just make anything into a hammer.

336
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,120
You can't use ice or butter or pillows to hammer in nails.

337
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:54,481
And that's because they've got the wrong causal properties.

338
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:55,680
They're not suitable.

339
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,681
Remember, suitable is one of the features.

340
00:31:57,681 --> 00:32:00,321
We didn't talk much about suitable, about equipment.

341
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,680
We talked about what was appropriate according to the culture.

342
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:05,921
And we talked about, what was the third one?

343
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:09,041
We had three finally.

344
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,160
Suitable.

345
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:10,881
Yeah.

346
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:13,040
Uh-oh.

347
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
Again.

348
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,040
Yeah, okay, I talk louder.

349
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,961
Is that okay?

350
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:19,601
Well, well good.

351
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,160
Keep me doing this.

352
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,921
But what are we doing?

353
00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:24,801
What are we doing now?

354
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
We've got, I just have to review.

355
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,000
We said that to be equipment, it had to be suitable.

356
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,600
It had to be socially appropriate.

357
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,560
And what?

358
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,880
Yeah.

359
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,560
Not the whole theory.

360
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:45,000
What was the I had a name for each of these things?

361
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,600
It had to have, let me think, it has to be suitable.

362
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,121
It has to have, that's what he's saying too.

363
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:57,321
It has to have a function.

364
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:57,880
Ah yeah.

365
00:32:57,881 --> 00:33:01,000
It has to have a function in the system of other equipment.

366
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,201
And it has to be socially recognized as that being its appropriate function.

367
00:33:08,201 --> 00:33:08,840
Right.

368
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,081
Now, why am I saying this?

369
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:16,280
Because that's.

370
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,721
I'm trying to talk about the causal properties.

371
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:20,601
Oh, yeah.

372
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:24,280
And the causal properties are what makes it suitable.

373
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,680
That is, as I just said, you've got to have the right causal properties for hammering.

374
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:41,321
So in a certain sense of founded, which I think he would call underlies, the president hand is going to underlie the ready-to-hand.

375
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,880
But on the other hand, and that's the new idea, I mean, that's the old idea.

376
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,881
I mean, that's what everybody from Descartes to Searle would say.

377
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,401
That's how it's founded.

378
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:00,521
That Heidegger wants to say, but there's another kind of founded, which is what makes it intelligible as a such and such.

379
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:05,641
And none of these causal properties make something intelligible as a hammer.

380
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:18,800
So if you're asking what founds this intelligibility, or what underlies the intelligibility, it's got to be its role in the world of coping Daseins.

381
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,440
And that's fundamental and founding.

382
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:23,041
So they're just two foundings.

383
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:30,800
And as I put it, I don't know if you brought the chart, I said to bring this chart of the modes of being of entities other than Dasein.

384
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,321
I'm not going to read all these details.

385
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:36,400
How many don't have the chart?

386
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:47,200
I was going to make more, but I didn't bring more because I'm not going to talk about it long and because I found some typographical and other little sort of mistakes on this one that make me want to fix it.

387
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:50,641
Then I'll put it on the website in a better form.

388
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:54,640
But for the time being, it's good enough, and it is on the website.

389
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,961
You can find it and print it.

390
00:34:57,121 --> 00:35:02,880
But all I want to say is, you can, reading from the top down and the bottom up means the following.

391
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:14,961
On the left-hand column, so if you read it from the bottom up, never mind that bottom, which is pseudo-stuff that philosophers invent, and Heidegger doesn't believe in.

392
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,241
But if you believe in the present at hand and no more, that's the theoretical stuff.

393
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:25,601
You see isolable determinate properties.

394
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:27,681
The hammer weighs 500 grams.

395
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,161
It's all about there's a universe that governs these theoretical elements.

396
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:43,921
Then you read it from the bottom up and you try to account, and period, and you say, and these causal properties underlie readiness to hand.

397
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,840
They don't account for readiness to hand.

398
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,760
That would be the mistake.

399
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,681
That's what Searle and Descartes tried to do.

400
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:58,480
Heidegger thinks you can't use physical properties to account for meaningful relations as the readiness to hand.

401
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,401
So you read it from the top down.

402
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:08,841
That means that the most intelligible thing for us is equipment functioning.

403
00:36:09,161 --> 00:36:17,481
And then on the basis of that, you know, now we get the on the basis founding, which is different than physical causal founding.

404
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,961
On the basis of that, you can make the unready to hand intelligible.

405
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:38,440
And on the basis of that, you can say, well, and if you left out all the situational properties of the ready to hand and the unready to hand, what you'd have left is the present at hand.

406
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,241
So you derive its intelligibility.

407
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:51,721
What it is to be present at hand is founded on what it is to be ready to hand and unready to hand and on their its being having a place in the world.

408
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:53,560
And remember, Heidegger's quite clear about that.

409
00:36:53,561 --> 00:37:03,161
I keep quoting this phrase: the presence of hand depends on us, but the present at hand doesn't depend on what's present at hand doesn't depend on us.

410
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:12,521
So there's that stuff, what's present at hand, which doesn't depend on us, which founds the suitability of the hammer.

411
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:37,721
And then there's the under the intelligibility of it, and the being of it as being ready to hand or being present at hand, and that depends on us, and you can derive being present at hand as a more and more attenuated version of readiness to hand.

412
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:40,040
I mean, that's very mysterious, what I just said.

413
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:45,321
And I'll try I'll say what I mean, but we'll we'll have to go over it more when we get to the Descartes thing.

414
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,241
Why do you have to derive it that way?

415
00:37:47,840 --> 00:38:09,441
Well, the punchline of the Descartes part is really you cannot make sense of the present at hand independent of understanding that mode of being or that mode of intelligibility as being having a lot left out of the readiness to hand.

416
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:21,601
And what and what you can't do is try to make sense of the ready to hand by adding something to the intelligibility of the present at hand.

417
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:24,961
That's why the founding relation goes both ways.

418
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:38,081
If the causal one goes up and the uh the intelligibility founding goes down, I think it's just important to say that because uh sooner or later people get worried and confused about it.

419
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:44,961
And this is sort of the answer to what he's saying on one hundred one as a question.

420
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:53,681
And well, more than a question, let's go above right, a bit above seventy-two in the margin, one hundred one, sorry, one hundred one in the English.

421
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:08,001
Where in the middle of that big paragraph, to lay bare what is just present at hand and no more, cognition must penetrate beyond what is ready to hand in our concern.

422
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:19,280
Readiness to hand is the way in which entities as they are in themselves, in quotes, just when they're being themselves, are defined ontologically categorially.

423
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:26,720
That's always conf funny that he wi wants to put re remember he puts readiness to hand in category because it's not Dasein.

424
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:32,361
Everything that isn't Daseine, which is existentials, comes under categories.

425
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:33,721
I wouldn't, I don't like that.

426
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,320
I think you need another word for it.

427
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,920
But anyway, it doesn't matter for us.

428
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:38,120
We'll just take it his way.

429
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:47,081
And now, somebody comes along, so to speak, like an interlocutor and says, yet only by reason of something present at hand is there anything ready to hand.

430
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,641
And you think that's right?

431
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,721
Yeah, I think that's right, because that's the causal claim.

432
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:59,401
If there wasn't anything that had any causal properties, there certainly wouldn't be any hammers or any other equipment.

433
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,081
So that's not wrong.

434
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:09,480
But now, does it follow, however, granting this thesis for the nonce, that readiness to hand is ontologically founded on the presence at hand?

435
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,360
What's the answer?

436
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,800
Does it follow?

437
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,081
No, because ontologically founded has to do with intelligibility.

438
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:22,441
So you can say, yes, the present, without the present at hand, there wouldn't be any ready-to-hand.

439
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:29,960
But you also have to say that without our understanding of the being of the ready-to-hand, we couldn't make any sense of the being of the present at hand.

440
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,560
Does that blow your minds?

441
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:32,440
If so, I'm sorry.

442
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,600
It's not really that hard.

443
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:38,841
And am I starting to talk to myself again?

444
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,160
I mean, I dropped back into.

445
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,520
So, yeah.

446
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:45,960
Yeah, good.

447
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,440
Say something.

448
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,280
I can see you looking worried from clear over here.

449
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,121
So tell me what worries you.

450
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:43,760
Well, that's this is too hard for now.

451
00:41:44,161 --> 00:41:47,600
We have to debate this when we get to the reality chapter.

452
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:53,201
It's really got to do with sort of what is his view of nature.

453
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:58,800
And here, when he talks about nature on 100, he's saying, well, there's lots of ways to understand nature.

454
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:20,641
You can understand it as ready to hand when it's the wind and the windmill and the water and the dam, or you can understand it as the sort of stuff, and you can understand it even as the romantics understand it as this overwhelming overwhelming something or other.

455
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:36,641
And so, but it's so, but what you're really asking is, but how in the world are we supposed, well, how do we understand the status of the entities that supposedly have the causal properties that account for the way the hammer works?

456
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:41,441
And that's like asking how do we understand the status of electrons.

457
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,721
And the first thing to say is, well, the electrons are intelligible thanks to us.

458
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:51,841
They're intelligible as present at hand, and they're intelligible as having whatever our theory says.

459
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:59,601
And then there's the further question: and would there still be electrons if there wasn't any Dasein, if there'd never been any Dasein?

460
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:02,241
Were there electrons coming out of the Big Bang?

461
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,720
Well, science certainly says there were.

462
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:12,361
And I'm going to talk about this, but way later in the course, I think Heidegger completely agrees with science on this.

463
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,561
Heidegger thinks there are two, but I think Tyler doesn't think that, and we'll have to debate it.

464
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,441
There was one more way I was going to put it, just a second.

465
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,841
I mean, why do I, I just had one more thought about electrons, whether they were around all the time or not.

466
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:45,320
Well, I can only just repeat.

467
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,320
I think that he thinks that the present at hand in some way underlies the ready-to-hand.

468
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,201
I'll show you a passage.

469
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:59,481
And I can't think of any other way except causally.

470
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:09,881
And I can't think of how it could do it causally if it wasn't that there were, in the jargon of the philosophy of science, natural kinds with causal properties.

471
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,000
But that's, I was going to say, I'm not going to talk about it now.

472
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:22,280
I'm just going to mention, I think I may have mentioned already, Heidegger was a math and science major as an undergraduate.

473
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:36,280
And I really sort of, this is not an argument, but I think once you were, I was too, you can't really ever believe that the scientific, that the electrons aren't out there with their mass and charge and spin, whether anybody's around or not.

474
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,241
But that's not enough just to believe it because you've been sort of conned into it.

475
00:44:41,241 --> 00:44:47,241
You have to have an argument, and I haven't given you an argument, and we won't get an argument until we get to the part on reality.

476
00:44:47,920 --> 00:45:00,881
But I'll show you a place where I think my way of looking at it glimmers through in the midst of such murkiness that I don't expect anybody to be blown away and believe it.

477
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,000
Okay, where is it?

478
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:10,001
Ah, it's the same passage where the unready to hand comes in that I've been talking about at the beginning at the beginning of the today.

479
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,120
Help, help.

480
00:45:11,121 --> 00:45:12,321
Where is it?

481
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,041
Somebody has it in their notes, I'm sure.

482
00:45:15,041 --> 00:45:19,360
Where I where I what problem?

483
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,401
Well, yeah, I think that's right.

484
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,960
No, but 103, that's close.

485
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:39,280
Okay, the crucial sentence here is that it looks like in some way the present at hand has been underlying the ready-to-hand all along.

486
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:42,480
So when he says, are we going to grant that for the nonce?

487
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,321
I think he grants it.

488
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,241
Then the question is how that happens.

489
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:50,000
But here's what he says here about the underlying, which I think is important.

490
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,561
I'm going right after unreadiness to hand at the top of 103.

491
00:45:56,561 --> 00:46:00,560
But this implies that what cannot be used just lies there.

492
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,640
If you're staring at it, just lies there.

493
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:05,681
You're not using it.

494
00:46:05,681 --> 00:46:10,000
It shows itself as an equipmental thing which looks so-and-so.

495
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:17,520
I mean, this thing, people call it a hammer, it's lying there, it's got a blob and it's got a shank and it's got properties and so forth.

496
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:28,001
Now, an experimental thing which looks so-and-so and which, in its readiness to hand is looking that way, has constantly been present at hand too.

497
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,001
So, what does that mean?

498
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:36,920
I mean, that's some recognition that the suitability of the hammer makes it has been there all along.

499
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,760
It's just something that you aren't paying any attention to, and rightly so.

500
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:46,040
That is, again, pure presence at hand announces itself in such equipment, but withdraws.

501
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:49,081
That's a different sense of withdrawal than when you're using it.

502
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,721
But it withdraws to the readiness to hand of something which one concerns oneself.

503
00:46:53,721 --> 00:47:00,121
That is, you stop paying attention to the properties when you're using it, and so forth.

504
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:02,040
And that's it.

505
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:03,640
I mean, that's it for the time being.

506
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,920
Put it aside.

507
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:11,401
If you want to write your second paper on whether Heidegger's a realist about science, it's a great subject.

508
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:19,320
I struggled with it for years, and I think I understand it now, but it's not obvious by any means.

509
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:36,601
In fact, almost all the commentaries you're going to read, if you read other commentaries than mine, you're going to find even the great Bill Blattner, whom I admire immensely for having a very good grip on this thing, thinks that Heidegger is an idealist about science.

510
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:43,161
But so that's now we've got to go on, and we'll get back to that someday.

511
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,401
Now we've got to talk about the structure of the world.

512
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,160
We haven't really done that yet.

513
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,041
We promised that Heidegger's going to do what Wittgenstein couldn't do.

514
00:47:56,041 --> 00:48:03,001
And we've got to overthrow the subject-object-self-world distinction, which we promised to do, but we haven't done it yet.

515
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:07,800
And that's for the rest of today and all of Thursday.

516
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,241
That's the job.

517
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:23,440
And I'm going to read you something from the Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, because it's so interesting how Heidegger says that he doesn't say doing Vittgenstein's job and finding the structure of the world is his job because that just hadn't occurred to him.

518
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,241
But he does think it's his job to destroy the subject-object distinction.

519
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:32,001
And he thinks that that distinction has been around forever.

520
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:34,641
And now it's got to be fixed.

521
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:37,440
But first, that it's been around forever.

522
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,201
This is on page 130.

523
00:48:39,201 --> 00:48:43,201
I used to think the subject-object distinction starts with Descartes, and it does in a way.

524
00:48:43,201 --> 00:48:51,921
He names subjects, and he names objects instead of substances, and subjects instead of, I don't know, people or something.

525
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,480
And he treats them as more self-sufficient.

526
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,321
He has a lot of different properties.

527
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,120
Heidegger's going to go into this in amount of detail, which I should warn you, don't worry about it.

528
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:16,800
I might forget to say this, next week, when we get to the destruction of Descartes himself, so to speak, there's lots of detailed discussion of what res extensa is and what res cogitans is.

529
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,480
Don't get bogged down in it.

530
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,681
You don't have to know it to understand the refutation that he's going to give.

531
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:35,201
But I now see that anyway, he thinks that something like the subject-object distinction, more like the self-world distinction, was around already.

532
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:37,920
And Descartes just sharpened it up.

533
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:47,840
So on 130, he says, first full paragraph, 130, not of the being in time, but of the metaphysical foundations of logic.

534
00:49:47,840 --> 00:50:22,280
Remember, I keep repeating this just show you, the two books that are like bookends around, well, the three books that are casting light on being in time all the time, and which I put on the recommended reading list are the history of concept of time, which was written before being in time, the basic problems, which was the course Heidegger gave the year being in time was published, and then a year later, this course, which is, so that Heidegger's getting clearer and clearer about being in time.

535
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:29,960
One more thing I should remember to say: I have, of course, put all the recommended reading in the Howison Philosophy Library.

536
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,000
I never said that.

537
00:50:31,001 --> 00:50:32,040
That's important.

538
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:40,361
I mean, you're welcome to buy it if you can afford it and want to have a lot of Heidegger around, which I certainly like to do.

539
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,040
But you don't have to buy it.

540
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:49,400
You can go read these passages that I'm talking about in the Philosophy Library, which is on the third floor of Moses.

541
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:57,561
So here's what he says: It's remarkable that the problem addressed by this claim, okay, and that's, let's start one sentence earlier.

542
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,520
Being by is an existential.

543
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:06,521
That being by is the thing that is badly translated being alongside the world.

544
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,480
Being by with a BY isn't much help either.

545
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,920
That's being a mist.

546
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,440
As an existentiale is, of course, itself a problem.

547
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,841
It's a problem precisely because of the seeming self-evidence of the premise of a subject-object relation.

548
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,601
That is, how are you in the world?

549
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:27,081
Well, that's what we need to know.

550
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,361
And it's an existential, if you are somehow roughly at home in the world.

551
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,760
And now he's going to try to talk about that.

552
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,001
It's a remarkable problem.

553
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:42,921
It is remarkable that the problem addressed by this claim cannot be budged.

554
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:47,241
It is as old as philosophy and appears already in Parmenides.

555
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,921
In fact, how wrong I used to be.

556
00:51:49,920 --> 00:52:16,481
The view developed early and easily in the pre-philosophical understanding of Dasein, that the soul, thinking and representing and conscious, the soul thinking and representing and consciousness establishes a relation to objects, or put conversely, that being occurs before and lies opposite to thinking, seeing, and representing.

557
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:28,800
This view, this understanding of Dasein persisted for a long time in a general and vague form, and then he says how it got worked out more in the medieval and more in Descartes and more in Kant.

558
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:42,241
And then he says, on 131, the I said, so he doesn't, as I said, knows that he's going to show that there is a structure to worldhood, but boy, does he know that he has to destroy this.

559
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:44,640
It's more than just destroy Descartes.

560
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:48,000
It's more than destroy Descartes to John Searle.

561
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:51,440
It's something, it's very, very big.

562
00:52:51,440 --> 00:53:08,800
He says, bottom of 131, still in the metaphysic foundations of logic, one of the main tasks of being in time is to bring this relation, that is subject-object kind of relation, radically to light in its primordial essence and to do so with full intent as the first characterization.

563
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:24,080
And then he says, my essential intention is to first pose the problem and work it out in such a way that the listen to this, that the essentials of the entire Western tradition will be concentrated in the simplicity of a basic problem.

564
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:38,201
So he thinks that the whole philosophical tradition sort of hangs on this, and he's going to refute it, and that's that's he knows what he's doing, and he's going to do a good job of it.

565
00:53:38,201 --> 00:53:39,721
And now, where are we?

566
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:40,841
Let's see.

567
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,081
And how is he going to do it?

568
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:48,361
Well, he's got several moves.

569
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,280
I said he already missed one of the moves.

570
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:56,280
He could have done it partly by the holism of aspects, but he didn't make a deal out of that.

571
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,200
But that's not a big deal one anyway.

572
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:03,881
The big deal one we've already read is on 97, 68 in the German.

573
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:16,360
Now, we're looking for ways in which he's going to show that this holism of world is, that there is a holism to the world.

574
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,601
It's all interdefined.

575
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:25,800
And he's going to show that when you follow out that interdefining, it's going to destroy the distinction between self and world.

576
00:54:26,121 --> 00:54:27,720
That's the job.

577
00:54:27,721 --> 00:54:31,800
So first you have to see that it's interdefined, and that's on 97.

578
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,040
We've read it once, but it's very important to him.

579
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:41,961
And I don't know any place in these other books of the same period where he says it, although he certainly knows it's important.

580
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:55,321
He says, equipment, in accordance with its equipmentality, always is in terms of its belonging to other equipment, inkstand, pen, ink, paper, blotting pad, table, lamp, and furniture, windows, doors, rooms.

581
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:02,120
These things never show themselves approximately as they are we encounter, and so forth and so forth.

582
00:55:02,121 --> 00:55:09,241
That is, and then he says in another place, I didn't quote it, and I don't think I could just open to it, there is no such thing as an equipment.

583
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:11,880
That's the same claim.

584
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,041
If anybody knows right where that is, I would like to see it.

585
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,600
I'm on 97.

586
00:55:17,601 --> 00:55:18,961
We're on 90.

587
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:20,481
Middle paragraph.

588
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:28,080
Ah, taken strictly, first line of the first full paragraph on 97, 68 in the German.

589
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:29,520
Funny, I haven't marked it.

590
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:34,001
Taken strictly, there is no such thing as an equipment.

591
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:36,881
That's the interdefiningness.

592
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,840
But that's just the beginning.

593
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:47,521
Now comes a whole job of showing how this whole equipment is related to us.

594
00:55:48,161 --> 00:55:55,280
Well, first, how the whole equipment is related to each other, because all he just said is a bunch of names of table, chair, lamp, floor.

595
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,521
How are they related to each other in this, in a holistic way?

596
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:08,561
We see the phenomena that there's no such, you can't take them out from the whole complex, but how is that complex going to be described?

597
00:56:08,561 --> 00:56:11,120
And then how is that complex going to be related to us?

598
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:12,561
That's the big deal.

599
00:56:12,561 --> 00:56:19,681
I hope we get here there this hour, but if not, we can have it as an amazing hanger hanging on something.

600
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:21,120
But let's see how far we can get.

601
00:56:21,121 --> 00:56:32,561
The way these things are all related to each other, the lectern, the table, the floor, the books, all that, is that they have reference to each other.

602
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:35,041
They have bearing on each other.

603
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:41,041
The German, the thing that gets translated, assignments on page 97.

604
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:47,681
All these business of equipment has this way of bearing on Earth being assigned.

605
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:50,481
It's just a name for what we've already been talking about.

606
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,361
In German, it's fairweisengen.

607
00:56:54,360 --> 00:57:01,681
And it's, and he, the translator uses references and other people use assigns.

608
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:10,201
So the question is, how are you going to describe the way that the lectern is related to my book?

609
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:15,641
Well, you could say that they're assigned to each other or that they refer to each other.

610
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,160
Both of them seem very wrong.

611
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:23,641
Refer seems to be too linguistic, and assign seems to be that somebody came along and assigned them.

612
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:26,201
I would say they bear on each other.

613
00:57:26,201 --> 00:57:28,600
But you might even find a better way to say it.

614
00:57:28,601 --> 00:57:30,441
Then you see what he's getting at.

615
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,920
They all relate to each other.

616
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,800
He doesn't like relate because it's too general and abstract.

617
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:43,961
They relate to each other, let's say, as equipment relates to its other equipment, and that is they bear on each other.

618
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,521
Or sometimes he says something that gets translated, they're involved with each other.

619
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:49,961
That's pretty good.

620
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:57,800
So the table, and that has its own strange quality when you think that the lectern has an involvement with the book.

621
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,721
It sounds too much like something Dasein might be having.

622
00:58:02,601 --> 00:58:04,841
But I think it'll do.

623
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,241
But I still prefer my bearing.

624
00:58:07,241 --> 00:58:13,800
So the hammer, and now you're going to hear a lot about the way this equipment bears on other equipment.

625
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:16,120
You see, all this has to be unpacked.

626
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:22,280
It's not going to just, you're not going to believe it if you're a good philosopher just because he says it.

627
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,201
He's got to show you.

628
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:34,920
And in showing you the way this works, the whole of equipment, he's also doing at the very same time laying out the structure of the world, answering Wittgenstein.

629
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,841
And he starts to tell you how all these interrelations work.

630
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:43,401
So it turns out the hammer is for pounding in nails.

631
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,481
So the hammer gets defined, and that gets through the, that's the inorder to.

632
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,081
A hammer, every piece of equipment has an inorder to.

633
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:57,200
And that's on where?

634
00:58:58,721 --> 00:59:01,601
Looks like I've got it on 98.

635
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:03,121
So let's go on.

636
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:19,520
At the bottom, dealings with equipment subordinate themselves to the manifold assignments, there's that use of it, of the inorder to.

637
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,601
And the inorder to is just whatever it is.

638
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:27,441
I hammer in order to drive in nails.

639
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,280
So the hammering bears on the nails, and it has an inorder to.

640
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,760
It has something, so to speak, that it's up to that it's going to do with the nails.

641
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:42,241
And that's, and the nails, the hammer bears on the nails, and the nail bears on the wood.

642
00:59:42,241 --> 00:59:49,760
The hammer is there in order to pound in the nails, towards making something fast, as he puts it.

643
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,841
That is, making the wood stick to the rest of the wood.

644
00:59:54,161 --> 01:00:00,400
We're all on 69 in the German, and now we're on, that was, we're now on 70, 99.

645
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,401
That's the towards which.

646
01:00:04,721 --> 01:00:08,640
So where are we then?

647
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:11,280
On, let me see, on 99.

648
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,760
Bottom paragraph.

649
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:24,001
The work to be produced as the towards which of such things as the hammer, the plane, the needle, likewise has the kind of being that belongs to equipment, and so forth and so forth.

650
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:25,920
So I'm just collecting these.

651
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,280
So you could, I could, I could write on the board with chalk, if I had chalk.

652
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:47,481
So I'll write on the board in order to, and then I'll just, I'll, towards which.

653
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,921
What's the phenomena?

654
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,641
Well, and then there's the with which.

655
01:00:53,641 --> 01:01:00,201
It sounds so hard to get a grip on, but when you just keep your eye on the phenomenon, it's a perfect example of what I said at the very beginning of today.

656
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:06,121
All this complicated structure, and then there's the in which.

657
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,280
Can you think of what that is?

658
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:27,321
I write with a piece of chalk in order to, well, I, you know, I use a piece of chalk, that's the with which, in order to write on the board towards the goal of explaining Heidegger in the classroom.

659
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:32,681
Now, and then there's still a for the sake of which.

660
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,441
Why do I do that?

661
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:49,721
Well, in order to, for the sake of getting you to understand Heidegger, and ultimately for the sake of which, and then the ultimate or the final for the sake of which.

662
01:01:49,721 --> 01:01:51,401
That's a long story.

663
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:59,881
The final for the sake of which has got to be the whole point of doing it.

664
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:05,321
My writing on the board, my final for the sake of which is, I'm a teacher.

665
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,401
And as a teacher, I do all that.

666
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,241
And that's the structure.

667
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:14,121
Now we go through it a little bit bit by bit.

668
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:17,000
So there's the towards which, and I just read that.

669
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,881
And then, and what is the for the sake of which?

670
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,960
For the sake, we're going back to the wood.

671
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:41,840
I hammer the nail into the wood in order to use the hammer in order to hammer a nail into the wood toward making it fast, then a bigger and a higher, longer toward toward making a frame.

672
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,760
There's a whole bunch of tords, towards making a house.

673
01:02:46,081 --> 01:02:50,881
And then the final question is, and why do I do all that?

674
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,441
This has something to do with being a carpenter.

675
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,760
Now we have to go through that.

676
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:01,121
So we've gone to the building of the house so far.

677
01:03:01,121 --> 01:03:03,200
But why is anybody building a house?

678
01:03:03,201 --> 01:03:06,721
Well, that's got to do with the point of the activity.

679
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:09,441
That gets translated involvement.

680
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,041
And involvement is okay, or relevance.

681
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:20,080
The hammer's involved with the nail, and the nail is involved with the wood, and the wood is involved with the frame, and the frame is involved with the house.

682
01:03:20,081 --> 01:03:21,521
That sounds sort of funny.

683
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:31,760
Maybe it's a little better to say the hammer is relevant to the nail, and the nail is relevant to attaching the wood, and the wood is relevant to making a frame, which is relevant to making a house.

684
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,161
That's how I would put it to myself.

685
01:03:34,161 --> 01:03:38,641
And the house is the primary towards which.

686
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:44,800
That's on page 116 or 84 in the German.

687
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,000
And here it is.

688
01:03:55,601 --> 01:03:58,640
So he's about 10 lines down.

689
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:09,241
With the towards which of serviceability there is again an involvement with this thing, for instance, which is ready to hand and which accordingly call a hammer.

690
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,561
There's an involvement in hammering.

691
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:14,040
With hammering, there's an involvement in making something fast.

692
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:17,881
With making something fast, there's an involvement in protection against bad weather.

693
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,961
And this protects shelter, so you're going to, maybe we should have put shelter in there.

694
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,721
So that's the point of it.

695
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:29,641
And this protection is for the sake of providing shelter for Dasein.

696
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:33,561
And that's putting it all together now.

697
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:41,001
But now there's a kind of interesting puzzle that Heidegger doesn't make as clear as he should, though he's clear about it.

698
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:47,561
So the final towards which, we've still got to say something more about that.

699
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,481
So it's on 116 at the bottom.

700
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,641
Now, but let me motivate this.

701
01:04:55,641 --> 01:05:09,321
It's going to turn out to be misleading if one thinks that Dasein's final point that makes the whole job of building the house make sense is to make a shelter.

702
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:11,481
What's wrong with that?

703
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,841
Well, it's only not Dasein-y enough.

704
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,160
That is, beavers can do that.

705
01:05:17,161 --> 01:05:17,880
They do it.

706
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:23,400
They organize their equipment, their mud, and their logs, and they organize themselves.

707
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,121
I don't know how they do it, but they've got a whole system and assign jobs to various beavers.

708
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:30,441
And when it's all done, they have a lodge.

709
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,560
And look at that.

710
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:39,561
They've got in, and it looks like they've got in order to's and towards witches, and for the sake of witches, they obviously make the lodge for shelter.

711
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,881
Something seems to have gone wrong.

712
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:46,721
If you really believed that about Dasein, you'd be a sort of sociobiologist.

713
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:58,721
You'd ask, sort of, what natural thing in the Dasein animal is making it do this thing, which obviously has an important function in keeping it alive and so forth.

714
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:12,241
That's obviously the wrong way to think about it if you're going to try to understand the holism of equipment and why it exists at all and its relevance to Dasein.

715
01:06:12,241 --> 01:06:14,161
We haven't quite nailed it yet.

716
01:06:14,161 --> 01:06:18,641
Well, he finally nails it at the bottom of 116.

717
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,680
In the German, it's who knows?

718
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:22,721
84?

719
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:23,520
Yeah.

720
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:33,921
The primary towards which is a for the sake of which, but the for the sake of always pertains to the being of Dasein.

721
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,361
Now, everything hinges on getting that sorted out.

722
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,401
Shelter would depend on the being of Dasein, in that you might well die if you didn't have a shelter.

723
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,521
But that can't be, it's not that kind of being.

724
01:06:47,521 --> 01:06:50,241
What kind of being does Dasein have?

725
01:06:50,241 --> 01:06:53,360
Well, it's the kind of being that takes a stand on its being.

726
01:06:53,360 --> 01:07:09,841
So somehow this chain of this structure chain of the way equipment is holistic and gets its meaning has got to bottom out in the way Dasein takes a stand on its own being.

727
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,600
That's the kind of being of Dasein that we want.

728
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,280
What would it be?

729
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:25,440
Well, you do this whole job for, say, being a shelterer, or being a carpenter, or being a homemaker.

730
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,400
Who knows?

731
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,000
I mean, but my story, at least, I already told you the answer.

732
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:45,320
I said, you write on the board with chalk in a classroom in order to get, I take up talk in a classroom in order to write on the board towards explaining Heidegger for the sake of teaching you or something like that.

733
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,720
And what goes in here with the final for the sake of which when I told the story?

734
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:52,041
Being a teacher, right?

735
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:53,640
And that works perfectly.

736
01:07:53,961 --> 01:08:05,001
And that doesn't mean that everything I do, I had a brilliant student who was worrying about whether when he washed his hands and brushed his teeth, this whole in order-to story happened and how it came finally to his being a what.

737
01:08:05,241 --> 01:08:13,001
And the answer is, I think, something like, well, whatever you're doing that's significant gets this chain effect.

738
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:18,041
But lots of things you do are just routine and insignificant, and you just do them out of habit or something.

739
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:26,360
Heidegger isn't committed to the view that every time you use equipment like a toothbrush or soap or water, you've got to go into this whole chain.

740
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:32,040
But when you do anything that's meaningful, significant, you do go into this whole chain.

741
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:36,440
And now I have to give a little speech about being a teacher or whatever.

742
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,720
It could be a homemaker or whatever.

743
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:44,041
Then, here, Bill Blattner was at his absolute best.

744
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,961
I just said one thing I disagree with him on.

745
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,760
Here's something I totally learned from him.

746
01:08:50,761 --> 01:09:21,040
It turns out that Heidegger thinks in Division II, and it's very important, he says that the final thing here, the ultimate for the sake of which, which is the being that I, the stand I take on my being, using all this stuff to do it, that final thing is something that's not, that's in a kind of future, but it's not a future that ever arrives.

747
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:23,600
And you wonder what in the world does that mean?

748
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:30,800
And it's very important to Heidegger that the primordial future, the really important future, isn't something that ever becomes present.

749
01:09:30,801 --> 01:09:34,001
Now, don't worry about that, but just get the phenomenon.

750
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:41,280
The interesting thing that Blattner points out is that you can work toward getting a professorship, getting tenure, let's call it.

751
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:47,121
And you do all this and you write on the board and you have office hours and your grade papers, all of toward getting tenure.

752
01:09:47,121 --> 01:09:50,081
And it's in the future, and one day you get it.

753
01:09:50,081 --> 01:09:57,920
And then it's in the present, and it stays there unless you lose it for some bad thing.

754
01:09:57,921 --> 01:09:59,201
And then it's in the past.

755
01:09:59,201 --> 01:10:01,920
But that's not what it's like to be a teacher.

756
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:13,840
If you get your understanding of who you are by whatever it is, and I'll just stick to mine, I've got to have the phenomenon in front of me, it coordinates all your activity.

757
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:16,640
You never arrive at being a teacher.

758
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,040
It's always, so to speak, ahead of you.

759
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:26,960
But in a kind of future that is never going to arrive, but you've got to, it constantly organizes what you do.

760
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:36,320
And if you're also, if being a father is also something, again, you have a baby and you become a father and it was in the future.

761
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,520
And okay, there's the baby.

762
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,560
Now you're a father.

763
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:46,960
But there's another sense of being a father, which is a full-time job that you just got for the rest of your life when you got this baby.

764
01:10:46,961 --> 01:10:56,241
And that's the kind of thing that Heidegger has in mind as the ultimate for the sake of, that connects up with Dasein's being.

765
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,760
Now you're ready to understand the punchlein in a certain sense.

766
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:01,360
We did get there today.

767
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:07,000
Why is it so important that he makes this that it comes out this way?

768
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:11,880
Well, to begin with, Dasein has to take a stand on its being.

769
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:30,920
Its being now turns out to be something like an identity it gives itself using, I think, roles that are around in the society, but like being a teacher or being a shelterer, you can't just probably invent this out of nowhere.

770
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,920
But you take it up as your way of being.

771
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:52,520
But you can't take it up, and now comes I was just reviewing now, but the next move, you can't take up, say, being a teacher if there isn't a world full of equipment for being a teacher, chairs, classrooms, lights, chalkboards, lecterns, and all that.

772
01:11:52,520 --> 01:12:01,241
And if that equipment isn't functioning, I mean that equipment has to function in order for you to be a teacher.

773
01:12:01,241 --> 01:12:03,880
You can't just sit home and say, boy, I am a teacher.

774
01:12:03,881 --> 01:12:10,041
I don't like my I don't go to office hours and I don't like grading papers, but I really think of myself as a teacher.

775
01:12:10,041 --> 01:12:12,680
That doesn't work, according to Heidegger.

776
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:15,880
You are what you do, he says at one point.

777
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:18,680
And now comes the crucial thing.

778
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:27,880
If you you are what you do, that means then, among other things, that you have to use all this equipment to be a teacher.

779
01:12:27,881 --> 01:12:31,560
And you can't be a teacher without the equipment.

780
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:47,760
And the equipment can't work together in this holistic way of having a point, what he's later going to call, I didn't get there quite today, signific a significance without connecting up finally with for the sake of witches.

781
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:54,480
So the equipment gets its significance by connecting up with an ultimate for the sake of which.

782
01:12:54,961 --> 01:13:00,720
And the ultimate for the sake of which is possible at all thanks to all that equipment.

783
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:08,081
Well, now the punchline, maybe it's dawning on you, what's happened to the distinction between self and world?

784
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:19,920
It turns out you can't understand what it is to be a self, namely in this case a teacher or whatever, except by working with all that equipment in the world.

785
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:34,640
And you can't understand the significance of all that equipment, except that all of it, it connects up somewhere somehow, or at least a lot of it, doesn't matter if all of it, what's significant in it, connects up with roles that people have taken up in the culture.

786
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:42,960
So he has made his move of showing the total way it all functions together.

787
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:47,520
Now let me see, I'm going to skim to see because I went off for a while on my own.

788
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:54,640
Let's look at basic problems 297.

789
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,921
So it says, let's see, I will just read it and if it turns out to be what I want, let's hope it's what I want.

790
01:14:08,961 --> 01:14:21,280
It says, world, about two-thirds down.

791
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,880
World is a determination of Dasein's being.

792
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:29,360
This is expressed from the outset when we say that Dasein exists as being in the world.

793
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,960
The world belongs to Dasein's existential constitution.

794
01:14:35,241 --> 01:14:40,680
Or world exists only if Dasein exists, only if there is Dasein.

795
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:50,201
And then finally, now at the bottom of 297, self and world, this is the punchline, belong together in a single entity, Dasein.

796
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:54,760
Self and world are not two beings, like subject and object, like I and thou.

797
01:14:54,761 --> 01:15:02,840
Self and world are the basic determination of Dasein itself in the unity of the structure of being in the world.

798
01:15:03,161 --> 01:15:05,161
So that's pretty good, I think.

799
01:15:05,161 --> 01:15:09,880
He's really made an argument there.

800
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:18,040
Now, I hope somebody has something to say because I don't want to sort of start saying something else.

801
01:15:18,841 --> 01:15:19,480
Good.

802
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,520
Say something.

803
01:15:35,241 --> 01:15:39,640
Yeah, because of this funny fact that Dasein is what it expresses itself as.

804
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:43,800
It goes back to its being is an issue for it.

805
01:15:43,801 --> 01:15:51,560
So to express itself, it has to take a stand on what it is, to be a father, a teacher, or whatever.

806
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,840
And it can do that only by using the equipment for that.

807
01:15:56,841 --> 01:16:03,320
And there wouldn't be equipment for that if there weren't people who understood their being that way.

808
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,920
I'm just repeating myself, but that's that's a helpful, yes.

809
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:14,921
I see.

810
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:16,201
Well, yeah, I mean, good question.

811
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:17,201
She's not convinced.

812
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,800
She says they're interdependent, but he's sort of gotten rid of the notion of self and world at all.

813
01:16:17,081 --> 01:16:24,161
It's really the same as his question.

814
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:39,201
I mean, if you really can't understand self except as it is expressed through equipment, if you can be a self except when you're coping using the equipment, then you've got the missing link.

815
01:16:39,201 --> 01:16:40,001
She's convinced.

816
01:16:40,001 --> 01:16:42,161
That was simpler than one might have thought.

817
01:16:42,161 --> 01:16:44,560
But Heidegger has got a real neat move there.

818
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,720
I think it is convincing.

819
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,560
Anybody else?

820
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,201
Yeah, Dave.

821
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:56,560
It can't be anything.

822
01:16:59,921 --> 01:17:00,640
Good point.

823
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:04,800
Right.

824
01:17:04,801 --> 01:17:09,121
You can try to abstract the equipment as a whole and world.

825
01:17:09,121 --> 01:17:12,640
And he does, when he talks about it, then just gives you the structure of the world.

826
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,640
He doesn't have to talk about self.

827
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,921
And you can, well, he does, but he could not talk about this.

828
01:17:17,921 --> 01:17:20,720
Then he could give you the structure of the world without then.

829
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,121
And sometimes you want to talk about self.

830
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:23,520
I did.

831
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,241
I said I'm defining myself as a teacher.

832
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:32,081
But to be a self, then you have to put this in.

833
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:38,880
Then the whole world structure, at the most basic level, as Dave says, the whole world structure has to be there.

834
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:40,001
And it is.

835
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,680
You are what you do.

836
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,040
And so at the most basic level, you can't separate them.

837
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:50,880
But you can abstractly, by leaving out certain pieces, abstract them.

838
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:52,001
That's what I'm saying.

839
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:52,560
So you leave.

840
01:17:58,081 --> 01:18:00,161
Okay, well, okay, well, be careful.

841
01:18:00,161 --> 01:18:02,241
I mean, scientists mostly study the universe.

842
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:17,161
I didn't make a big deal about it, but when you got the distinction between the existentials and the categories, I did probably say that people, I did, I remember saying it because I talked about Terrence Malik at that point.

843
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,800
People are in the world, and scientists study the universe.

844
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:27,720
However, people also study the world of something or others from outside.

845
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:36,040
And when they do that, then they're doing social science, and then you can have a theory in which world play shows up.

846
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:47,961
But what they can't see is the source of the significance in that world unless they look at it from the point of view of an involved Dasein and so forth.

847
01:18:47,961 --> 01:18:52,600
So there are lots of interesting relations between self and world, another possible paper topic.

848
01:18:52,600 --> 01:19:00,121
What you can say about it from a theoretical point of view, what kind of abstractions you can make, what kind of abstractions you can't make.

849
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,640
Those are great questions.

850
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:05,161
Well, thanks for using just exactly the time that's left.
