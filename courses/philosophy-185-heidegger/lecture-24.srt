1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,481
But I learned something, something Curtis said, that maybe the myth is so interesting to Heidegger because at least it connects care and time, and he's really got nothing to go on to connect care and temporality.

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,401
He's got something, he's got a story about care that he can relate to his three aspects of being in.

3
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:32,321
But what he would like to do is get you to start to see that the structure of care is the structure of temporality.

4
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:35,280
But I don't have more to say about it, and I don't want to fall back into it.

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,800
I want to go on.

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:51,280
So now Heidegger's going to take up, remember, and in a way, as I say, Division I ends with care, because that's the meaning of being, that's the meaning of Dasein.

7
00:00:51,281 --> 00:01:01,600
That's the terms, in terms of which you can understand why Dasein has the structure it has, the threefold unified structure.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,880
Or at least you can begin to understand it, or at least you can name it.

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:28,801
But whatever that is, now there's two other very interesting, important sort of appendices or really that sort of interrupt the argument, the flow of the argument, because really he would be going on from care directly to Division II and temporality as the meaning of care.

10
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:32,680
That is, that in terms of which you can make sense of care.

11
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:36,840
But he doesn't, because he has important things to say about reality.

12
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:53,800
And he has, and there are two different issues about reality that he thinks rightly that his understand his phenomenology of Dasein enables him to make big steps forward concerning.

13
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:09,240
One of them, I think, he just totally wipes out the epistemology and the problem of the existence of the external world as a kind of, well, it's not quite a joke, but as a very, very total mistake.

14
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:16,920
And then he gets involved in this interesting, complicated question about realism, idealism, anti-realism.

15
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:25,721
What is the status of the entities that we deal with, the ready-to-hand and the present-to-hand.

16
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,480
So we've got to do both those things.

17
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Obviously, we're not going to do both today.

18
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:43,080
I'm going to do for sure this question about the reality of the external world, and I hope again the question about the that's a mind issue, the external world, I mean the inner-outer.

19
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:47,320
And then there's just the status of those entities out there in the universe.

20
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,080
That's what we're going to do next time.

21
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,760
Then we're going to be, we're still going to be one lecture behind, which isn't bad.

22
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,360
So let's do it.

23
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:56,760
Where are we?

24
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,680
So Heidegger's got the story now.

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:19,920
The Dasein, the structure of the way of disclosedness is the Dasein as taking a stand on it, Dasein takes a stand on its being, and that enables Dasein to disclose the world and discover entities, both ready-to-hand entities and present-at-hand entities.

26
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:21,441
That's not supposed to be news.

27
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,841
That's just supposed to be where we are.

28
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:28,480
And now he's going to draw conclusions about issues concerning reality.

29
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:40,560
And now there's so much that's just sort of said, the way, as he says it, is as good as I could say it, that I'm going to be reading a lot for a minute from where we are in the book.

30
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:51,680
Where we are in the book is on 244, German 200, which is the section on Dasein Worldhood and Reality.

31
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,841
And I want to start reading things the middle of 245.

32
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm in the middle of a sentence, in the middle of the page.

33
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:12,241
The interpretation of being takes its orientation from the being of entities within the world.

34
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,721
That's how it's always been.

35
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:36,161
Thereby, the being of what is primarily available, that is approximately ready to hand, gets passed over, and entities are first conceived in the context of things, race, which are occurrent, which are present at hand.

36
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:47,281
So he's just telling you, traditional ontology only has one understanding of being, namely that beings are what he calls present at hand.

37
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:56,321
He goes on, being acquires the meaning of reality, and now he says just what I've been saying, substantiality becomes the basic characteristic of being.

38
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:04,521
So that goes from back to Aristotle and behind Aristotle, back to Descartes and behind Descartes to Aristotle.

39
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,361
And now I want to see if I want to read more.

40
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:07,241
Yes, I want to go on.

41
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:20,600
Corresponding to this way in which the understanding of being has been diverted, namely leaving out the special kind of being of Dasein, leaving out the special kind of being of equipment, just focusing on the present at hand.

42
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,961
Even the ontological understanding of Dasein moves in the horizon of this conception of being.

43
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:29,721
Like any other entity, Dasein too is present at hand, is real.

44
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,800
And that is, it's a thinking thing.

45
00:05:33,800 --> 00:06:06,360
And now skipping way down to this last paragraph, second sentence, we must demonstrate that reality, that is as understood by the tradition, namely as substances, which are self-sufficient, is only one kind of being among others that are ontologically others, but that ontologically it has a definite connection in its foundations with Dasein, the world, and readiness to hand.

46
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:16,120
So we're trying to figure out, understand now how to relate this reality as substance story to all the phenomenology that Heidegger's been giving you.

47
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:20,040
And then he gives you what he's going to talk about at the bottom of 245.

48
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,600
Under the heading, the problem of reality, various questions are clustered.

49
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Whether, now I've tried to sort of retranslate this so that it makes a little more sense.

50
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:39,081
It's hard because in German, the Das zeinde could mean an entity, but it could mean the totality of entities.

51
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,000
Then I'm trying to make it mean what it needs to make sense at the bottom here.

52
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:50,800
So I want to say, one, see where we are, the bottom of 245, 201 bottom in German.

53
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:58,401
Whether the beings which supposedly transcend our consciousness, that's this totality of entities.

54
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:12,560
The beings which supposedly, beings, plural, stuff, things, which supposedly transcend our consciousness are at all, that is, the questions about idealism.

55
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,081
Whether this reality of the external world can be adequately proved, that's the first thing we're going to talk about in a minute.

56
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:22,321
That's the epistemology.

57
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:30,961
How far, now you have to say, this totality of beings, if it is real, is to be known in its being in itself.

58
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:32,801
Can you know nature?

59
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,240
Can you know the universe of beings as they are in themselves?

60
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,600
That's the ontological question we're going to get to next time.

61
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:51,600
What the meaning of this totality of beings, namely reality, signifies in general.

62
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,161
I'm not sure what that doesn't mean anything to me.

63
00:07:56,961 --> 00:08:07,601
Once he's done the epistemological question, which is the external world issue, and once he's done the realism-idealism question, that's the ontological issue.

64
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:18,320
I don't see what that last question is, what the meaning of this entity, namely the totality of beings, namely what traditionally has been called reality, signifies in general.

65
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,761
Keep your eye open for that.

66
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,120
Maybe we'll see what it means.

67
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,921
I never really paid attention till this minute.

68
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,080
But you can see that he's got it fixed later.

69
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:37,161
Here are the real issues: right following: A, reality is a problem of being, and that means whether the external world can be proved.

70
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:43,161
That is the answer to skepticism about whether there's an external world and how we know it.

71
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:47,241
Then, B, reality is an ontological problem.

72
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:52,601
That's what, whether there is any independent reality.

73
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:53,800
And reality is terror.

74
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,721
It's just his way of taking it back into his way of describing things.

75
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,561
Maybe that's what the last move is.

76
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,201
I'm interested in those first two moves.

77
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,441
So, we're going to do now epistemology.

78
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,561
Where epistemology means, how many have had the epistemology course we give?

79
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,281
Okay, well, you've heard about epistemology.

80
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:18,441
How many have heard about epistemology in 25B, Descartes and so forth?

81
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:19,320
Well, good.

82
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,761
I mean, that's where you should have heard about it.

83
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,401
That's why it's important to have that course.

84
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,281
It means it's the theory of knowledge in English, epistemology.

85
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:31,561
It's just fancier talk to call it epistemology.

86
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,121
And the theory, and it's about knowing.

87
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:38,040
It's about how we can know that there's an external world.

88
00:09:38,040 --> 00:10:02,680
And it's about skepticism because people, after Descartes, realized that if Descartes' right and there's a self-contained substance called the mind, and in it's all these experiences, they got a big problem as to how they ever, how anybody would ever know whether there was anything out there outside the mind that these experiences corresponded to.

89
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:07,321
And so, and they worried about it.

90
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:18,561
Heidegger says lots of the philosophers tried to prove that they could know the external world, and Heidegger thinks that's just a big mistake.

91
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:37,281
That is, you have to, when you do the phenomenology, you'll discover that this whole problem of what's how the inner gets to know the outer, that is the external world, is exactly, is a known problem.

92
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:42,161
It took a long time for Descartes to con people into it, and now it looks just natural.

93
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,960
How many of you, any of you, see you, how many of you were at Dretzky's talk yesterday?

94
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,081
Any of you?

95
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,241
Did you notice how he began?

96
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:53,281
I thought you would.

97
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,401
Yes, you would.

98
00:10:55,281 --> 00:11:10,961
He started by saying that what he's going to talk about is the kind of experience that's in our head, and that there's a disagreement about how detailed the experience or the representation of the world in our head is.

99
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:20,241
And he devoted his whole talk to an argument about that, never questioning somehow what in the world it would mean to say that all this experience was in our head.

100
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,721
Literally, he said, in our head.

101
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:32,161
And that's how much this, and Dretsky's a good philosopher and has written important things on intentionality and action.

102
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:34,881
He's retired now from Stanford.

103
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:53,121
I say partly this because he's also going to talk this afternoon from 4 to 6 in Moses Library with the way the library gets taken away from you, which is okay because in there there's going to be a lecture on what skepticism and self-knowledge, right?

104
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,001
I suppose that's related to this.

105
00:11:56,001 --> 00:12:07,561
I suppose that's going to be also about how you know what's in your head and how much of what you, well, never mind, I won't try to guess.

106
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,281
I'm going to go.

107
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:27,001
I suggest if you want to see a kind of very nice and very intelligent example, sort of fossil example of what Heidegger and Wittgenstein have, extinct species that Heidegger and Wittgenstein have sort of put out of their misery, you will then want to see this.

108
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:46,281
That reminds me of something Richard Rorty, who was always campaigning against epistemology, has this wonderful metaphor about when will this news that the epistemology there is no problem will reach his colleagues who are floundering around in the collapsing circus tent of Cartesianism.

109
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:55,881
So, anyway, you will all, after this course, be out of it and won't have those kind of problems anymore if you ever even had them.

110
00:12:55,881 --> 00:13:00,040
Okay, so and now we need some important distinctions.

111
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:09,001
So, he wants to distinguish between the world, which is disclosed by Dase Hon, and the entities that are discovered in the world.

112
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:19,641
I think way back I told you that that was actually an important distinction to pay attention to, but there hasn't been any real important reason up to now why it mattered whether we paid attention to it.

113
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:23,241
Now, it turns out that those are two separate questions.

114
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:42,040
He wants to both deal with the question whether we know the world at all, whether the whole, whether there's anything disclosed outside of our experience, and then he wants to know how we know about the particular things, what we know, and how we know we know it, about the things in the world.

115
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,440
Those are both questions for epistemology.

116
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:57,040
By the way, one more remark, which strikes me as important, and what strike you as important, where all this history of what you could write a history of recent philosophy is sort of what happened to epistemology.

117
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,560
Because it was once the required course when I was a graduate student, and the best professor in the department, C.I.

118
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,681
Lewis, taught it, and everybody took it seriously.

119
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,801
And the only question anybody ever asked about anything was, how do we know that domain of objects, and so forth.

120
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,241
And then I think it was, it certainly wasn't the influence of Heidegger.

121
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:21,361
I presume it was the influence of Wittgenstein mainly.

122
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,521
Epistemology just sort of faded out.

123
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:26,480
It's not a requirement anymore, as you all know.

124
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,281
It's one possible, it isn't, is it?

125
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,601
I'm not going to contradicting myself.

126
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:44,641
It's one possible upper division philosophy course you can take, but it's lost its position as the way you have to, the thing you have to know first and best before you can do philosophy.

127
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:57,040
And that's just another way of saying these arguments that we're going to hear, parallel arguments in Wittgenstein, which I'll mention later, have really gotten rid of it.

128
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,441
Okay, now we're going to talk about it.

129
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:17,521
So, Heidegger thinks that when you understand our way of being in the world, there's no way you can doubt the existence of the world, or the things in the world, and you can't doubt the things in the world either.

130
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:21,201
And that's, of course, because we're being in the world.

131
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:29,121
And moreover, and that's because we need entities in order to cope with entities, in order to take a stand on our being.

132
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:32,440
So once, so Dasein's got to have a world.

133
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:41,561
I mean, what the final status of it is is going to come up next time, whether maybe it's all some kind of big illusion.

134
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:50,841
But whatever it is, we've got to have the experience of disclosing a world and of coping with the entities in it.

135
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,080
That's just the kind of being we are.

136
00:15:53,080 --> 00:16:01,241
So in 247, he says, at the bottom of 246, it starts.

137
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:12,040
The question of whether there is a world at all and whether its being can be proved makes no sense if it's raised by Dasein as being in the world and who else would raise it.

138
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:16,441
That's the point I'm making now.

139
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,081
I just want to read you the other places where he says similar things.

140
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:34,361
This question of having a proof that Kant mentions of the Dasein of things outside us.

141
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:50,361
That's again, whenever you see the external world or the world outside us or how the inner gets out directed toward the outer and all that, that's all the same issue that he keeps wanting to say doesn't make any sense.

142
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,280
Let's see.

143
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:08,121
I have something marked as something I want to read, but now I'm not sure I want to read it.

144
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's read it just to find out.

145
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,520
It's a top of 247, back to that.

146
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:19,361
Furthermore, it is encumbered with a double signification, this business about Dasein being in the world.

147
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,920
The world is the wherein of being in.

148
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,361
Yeah, that's why I just want to repeat this.

149
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:25,520
I said it already, but I didn't read anything.

150
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,761
The world is the wherein of being in.

151
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,280
That's the disclosed thing.

152
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,680
And the world is entities within the world.

153
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,280
That's what you discover.

154
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,480
And notice he's got the first world is not in quotes.

155
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,201
That's it.

156
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,320
That's the space of everything, the openness to everything.

157
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:47,760
And then there is also the world in quotes.

158
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,440
Remember what the world in quotes means, back from that page where he defines the world, the totality of entities.

159
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:19,600
And that is so both the disclosive space and the totality of entities, and that's the when you're concerned fully absorbed with the entities, either have been, they've either been confused or are not distinguished, and the world, but the world is disclosed essentially along with the being of Dasein.

160
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:26,801
And with the disclosedness of the world, the world in quotes has in each case been discovered, you'll notice, too.

161
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:31,521
He's being very clear and careful about disclosed and discovered, and about quotes and unquotes.

162
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,881
He said all that up way back so he could say these things clearly.

163
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:42,081
And now one more quote that I think is important.

164
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,680
I don't see it.

165
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:48,881
Oh, 245.

166
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,320
Okay, let's look at, yes, the bottom of 245.

167
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,161
I jumped ahead and read it already, so that's why I don't need it.

168
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:12,520
So then he's going to give a new account of the traditional problems, he says on 246, which again, I'm just showing you that he's saying the things that I say, he says, because it's important to see it in the text.

169
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
The middle of 246.

170
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:21,881
It has long been held that the way to grasp the real is by the kind of knowing which is characterized by this beholding.

171
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:33,561
That's just a point which he makes every once in a while, that you can know things by equipment, and in fact, that's more basic to know something by using a hammer than by just looking at it.

172
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,320
Such knowing is as a way in which the soul or consciousness behaves.

173
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:41,401
See, this is the wrong way of thinking about it.

174
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:57,000
Insofar as reality has the character of something independent and in itself, the question of the meaning of reality becomes linked with that of whether the real can be independent of consciousness or whether there can be a transcendence of consciousness into the sphere of the real.

175
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,600
That's all epistemological.

176
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,800
Well, that's both.

177
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:10,520
Whether there is such a thing as the ontological question, whether we could know it by getting outside our minds is the epistemological.

178
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:21,241
And I would say on 252, he says it again.

179
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Yeah, there, I'm just jumping.

180
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,361
See, that was the beginning of this whole section.

181
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:38,840
Now I'm jumping to the end of the section about the skepticism of the external world, because that's where he actually makes this epistemology-ontology distinction, which is very important to keep in mind.

182
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:58,720
So, he says, right before B, right at 209 in the margin, on 252, our discussion of the unexpressed presuppositions of attempts to solve the problem of reality in ways that are just epistemological shows that this problem must be taken back as an ontological one into the existential analytic of Gasin.

183
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,520
Oh, that's not so helpful as I thought it would be.

184
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,641
It's true, but there are two meanings of ontological.

185
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:14,801
There's the ontological question about idealism and realism, and then there's Heidegger's claim that he's doing ontology, that is, he's describing the being of Dazine.

186
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:18,800
I think you had just better not listen to what I said for the five minutes.

187
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:23,600
It's not wrong, it's just not making the point that I wanted to make.

188
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:33,680
You don't need Heidegger to tell you that you can distinguish epistemology from ontology in the traditional, the traditional version of each, and that's all I've been saying.

189
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,320
So, now we're going to turn to epistemology.

190
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:51,040
And so, Heidegger takes up the question whether there is an external world and whether we could prove that there's an external world, given that all we've got access to is our own internal experience.

191
00:21:51,041 --> 00:22:06,641
And then, and so now he's going to talk about first the disclosed, the world as the open, open, the disclosed, disclosed disclosure space in general.

192
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,200
And then he's going to talk about the things in the world.

193
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,240
So, first we do the first one.

194
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:25,760
And we've already read, there's no way that Dasein can doubt the existence of the world in the sense of this openness to stuff that is so fundamental to what we are.

195
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,161
And I don't have to read that again, and probably not the other one either.

196
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:38,280
But just to sum up what he says, let's look at the middle of 249.

197
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:42,041
He's going to tell you, Dasein is openness to the world.

198
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:46,600
Dasein is, he'll say later, remember, I keep saying its world existingly.

199
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:51,240
We are open heads turned toward the world, to talk like Merlot Ponte.

200
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,081
And at the middle of 249, he says, if Dasein is understood correctly, it defies such proofs.

201
00:22:57,081 --> 00:23:01,401
That is, need proofs that there is a world outside of our private experience.

202
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:11,081
Because in its being, it already is, outside, that is, is what subsequent proofs demand, and necessary, deem, are necessary to demonstrate it.

203
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:13,960
Dasein is already outside itself.

204
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:25,001
It is, there's one funny place in Division II where he says it is the outside itself in and for itself, which is a mouthful, but that's just a very condensed version.

205
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,561
That's what it is, basically, the outside itself.

206
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:33,080
So you can't worry about how it got outside itself.

207
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:38,680
And so all the philosophical moves are hopeless.

208
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:51,161
But at the top of 250, he talks about them, and it's interesting to, because you'll come across them in other courses, probably less and less, as people get out of the circus tent of epistemology altogether.

209
00:23:51,161 --> 00:24:01,161
But at the top of 250, to have faith in the reality of the external world, that was what I learned as a graduate student, was animal faith in the external world.

210
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:07,641
There's a philosopher named Santiana, who is probably rightfully forgotten, was all interested in that one.

211
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:10,720
To prove the reality of the external world, I don't know.

212
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:19,200
Well, lots of people were trying, whether adequately or inadequately, all of them inadequately hiding your things, to presuppose it.

213
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:20,801
That's another interesting move.

214
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:22,801
That's really Searle's move.

215
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:29,680
Searle talks about how we just take for granted the external world in all of our everyday behavior.

216
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:41,200
He has the example that when you apply for a grant to study electrons, say, you don't have to include in the introduction to the grant that there are electrons out there independent of your experience.

217
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,121
You just can take that for granted.

218
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:45,121
Everybody can take for granted.

219
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:49,040
And so that's the sense in which you simply presuppose it.

220
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:54,881
Whether explicitly or not, yep, some people think you explicitly presuppose it.

221
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:57,520
Searle thinks you implicitly presuppose it.

222
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:21,040
Attempts such as these have not mastered in their own basis with full apparent, which have not mastered in their own basis, which have not mastered their own basis with full transparency, presuppose a subject approximately worldless or unsure of its world, which must at bottom first assure itself of the world.

223
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,040
Anybody read Cavell?

224
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:29,121
Cavel is one of the last, I think, of the philosophers who are very much concerned about this.

225
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:35,361
He thinks we have to acknowledge the external world and that that's some big better move.

226
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,641
But that's just another move.

227
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:41,520
Sort of, there is us and there is the world, and then there is some relation between us.

228
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:52,480
Cavell gave this paper at an APA meeting, an American Philosophical Association meeting, thinking that he really got a big, made a big step forward with acknowledging the external world or the world.

229
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:03,881
And Stroud commented on it and pointed out that it's just one more of a long line of hopeless versions of the relation between the us and the world.

230
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:05,401
And Kobell got very upset.

231
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,761
I mean, he turned very nasty.

232
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,720
That may have been the end of this particular paragraph.

233
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:15,641
So all of those aren't going to work.

234
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:18,040
And Heidegger knows that.

235
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,800
And so we go on.

236
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:22,760
So, and as he puts it, sort of all the proofs come too late.

237
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
There are so many different ways of saying this.

238
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:43,720
The next paragraph, the problem of reality in the sense of the question whether an external world is present at hand and whether such a world can be proved, turns out to be an impossible one, not because its consequences lead to inextricable impases, because the very entity which serves as its theme is one which repudiates any formulation of the question.

239
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,760
That's pretty clear and strong.

240
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,760
And I've just been saying that in various forms.

241
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:56,760
And I have here that there's a place where we talk about the inner.

242
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,920
I was going to just mention that because we haven't really yet.

243
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,840
No?

244
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:11,480
Okay, that's fine.

245
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:20,760
So it looks like you can't even state the skeptical question meaningfully, according to Heidegger.

246
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,081
And that is what I think we are supposed to that's the right thing to conclude.

247
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,641
It just doesn't make any sense.

248
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:42,280
How can you ask whether there is any external world or whether we know the external world, or how do we know the external world when the internal, external distinction doesn't get a grip on anything in the phenomenal world that you have to start from?

249
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:48,081
And he's just saying that on 250.

250
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:53,280
Now, I'm just repeating myself here.

251
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,200
So, now there's only one more question that needs to be taken up in this respect, and this is a funny one.

252
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,041
Well, why do people believe this?

253
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:11,680
And for all this time, I think not 2,000 years, because I don't think Aristotle had, for instance, the notion that all of his experience was inner.

254
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,240
I'm not sure if anybody knows Aristotle better.

255
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,121
You can tell me.

256
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:28,080
I think the inner thing starts with Descartes, but at least since Descartes, which is already 300 years, what, 1638 is the meditations?

257
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,520
400 years.

258
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,320
People have been under the influence of this.

259
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:35,200
And Heidegger has a very weak answer.

260
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,281
I don't know if any of you will have a better answer.

261
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,520
You're welcome to write a paper if you want.

262
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,760
I'll tell you his answer and my answer.

263
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:57,121
And I'll tell you that it's an interesting question to try to motivate all these smart philosophers, really smart philosophers, like Kant, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Descartes, believing there was this inner-outer problem.

264
00:28:57,121 --> 00:29:01,680
Heidegger thinks it's a form of falling, he says, at the middle of 250.

265
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:10,240
We have a tendency to bury the external world in nullity, epistemologically, before going on to prove it.

266
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:23,040
The reason for this lies in Dasein's falling, in the way in which the primary understanding of being has been diverted to being as presence at hand, a diversion which is motivated by the falling itself.

267
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,801
Boy, I don't know what that means.

268
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:29,841
If anybody does and wants to defend it or criticize it, I think it would be interesting.

269
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:34,280
I was just wondering about it yesterday and today.

270
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:40,440
I just, I mean, whichever meaning falling you've got, this doesn't seem to fit it.

271
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:54,121
It certainly can't be because people fall into their work, that is, they fall to work, they get absorbed in their flow, that they come and think, that they think that all there is is present-at-hand beings outside of our present-at-hand mind.

272
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:58,121
Is it, well, then it's because they're hiding from themselves their ungroundedness?

273
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:02,600
That seems a strange reason to be caught in this kind of epistemology.

274
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:07,401
Well, I'll give you what I think is a slightly better answer, but I doubt if I could defend it very long.

275
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:25,720
I think that it's because when you stop to think and do philosophy and reflect, then you get a distinction between the mind and the world.

276
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:48,760
The level at which John Searle talks about things, where there is the mind toward world direction of fit and the world toward mind direction of fit, and you're trying to do something and it hasn't happened yet, but you're trying to make the world come out a certain way, or the world is impinging on you in perception, and it's causing experiences in your mind.

277
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:55,641
All of this is a natural way, I think, or pretty close to a natural way to think about things when there's some kind of breakdown.

278
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:59,000
It's not a natural way to think about things when you're coping in the world.

279
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,881
And I'm not even sure it's very natural then.

280
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,920
I'm just, and I say I'm not very satisfied with this.

281
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:26,081
But at least when there's a breakdown and you've got to sort of confront the world, you do then sort of stand back and you see something like you've got these goals and you can't achieve them, but the goals are somehow in your mind, but your ability to achieve them depends on the stuff out there in the world.

282
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:33,280
And somehow, taking off from that, Descartes, you know, worked all this out.

283
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:41,040
He said he had to go into a warm room for the winter, totally free of passions of any sort, and reflect.

284
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:48,720
And out of that, he comes the meditations in which he doubts the existence of his own body and all kinds of very weird things.

285
00:31:48,720 --> 00:32:02,241
And I think it's that attitude of withdrawing from the world and reflecting, either because your workshop has broken down or because you're a philosopher like Descartes, that maybe gives you this wrong answer.

286
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,480
But I think it's a deep and interesting question.

287
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Why do we believe this?

288
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,121
Yeah.

289
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:21,440
Mind and the body, the function, and the relationship that we can do is part of that.

290
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,800
Well, that may be part of, maybe part, I don't see that.

291
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:30,881
I mean, that's sort of part of the problem, naturally.

292
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:48,560
When Descartes did withdraw, and if the stuff is inner and it's in your head, as Dretzky said, or in your mind, as Searle would say, then the body just drops out of the story as another object, I mean, I think.

293
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:50,720
And that's part of the problem.

294
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,481
But I don't want to spend time on it.

295
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:01,881
I just think that Heidegger is right to try to take it on, but hasn't done a good job of telling you the answer.

296
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:04,841
Okay, now, we still have another piece of it.

297
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:20,680
We've done, it's sort of done from the start whether Dasein is separate from the world, because we've done it, we did it by the definition that it's the being that takes a stand on its being by using beings and so forth.

298
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,920
But we haven't done the other half of it, which is exactly what I just said.

299
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,320
What about the totality of entities?

300
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:34,520
Besides this disclosive space, are there entities out there that we discover?

301
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,200
How do we ever know that we've discovered any of them?

302
00:33:38,441 --> 00:33:45,880
Or do we just are we always sort of in doubt and never able to be certain of anything out there?

303
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:57,320
This is what he's switching to on 251, where he says at the top: along with Dasein as being in the world, entities within the world have in each case already been disclosed.

304
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,001
That's what we're talking about now.

305
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:06,601
This existential ontological assertion seems to accord with the thesis of realism that the external world is really present at hand.

306
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:11,560
That's not, well, that's what that's what it seems to, but that's not what he thinks.

307
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:13,560
We'll get back to realism.

308
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:19,001
I want to just talk about the idea about the way things in the world.

309
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:38,440
I think that he's got a view, or he should have a view, that Charles Taylor, who is a very good phenomenologist and a fan of Merlot-Ponty, particularly, has this idea that you can't cope with things just coping with things is not like having a belief about them.

310
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:49,840
If you believe that there's a moon, then your belief can correspond to the moon or not correspond to the moon, and you may never be sure that you've got enough evidence to be sure, to know that there's a moon.

311
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,361
You can do it all if you think that the problem is how your beliefs relate to things in the world.

312
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:06,081
But if you're coping with things in the world, and then Charles Taylor says things like, well, you can't kick a football unless there's a football.

313
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,360
And that's different.

314
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:12,641
You can believe that there is a Santa Claus, even if there isn't a Santa Claus, and believe there is a moon or not.

315
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:19,440
But your skillful engagement with things requires that there be the things that you're engaged with.

316
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:25,200
You can't separate off your football kicking skills from actually kicking.

317
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,840
I think I can think of better examples than his.

318
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,361
So I'm going to give you two.

319
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:40,161
The examples which I think show that you couldn't exercise the skills that you've got if there weren't the entities on which you're exercising them.

320
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:42,400
And it may be more about my psychology.

321
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,081
People have told me that what I'm saying is just perhaps some people's phenomenology.

322
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:56,400
I think, for instance, that you can't have the skill for tying your shoelaces except if you've got your hands on your shoelaces.

323
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,041
You can't describe or you can't even go through the motions, try it, of tying your shoelaces without the laces.

324
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:08,800
I think that's the real intuition that Heidegger and Merloponte ought to have.

325
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,881
Or consider the famous example, do you know which finger you type the letter E on your typewriter?

326
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Now, maybe people differ.

327
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,720
I have no idea unless I try to imagine myself in front of the keyboard.

328
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,840
Even that doesn't work.

329
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,521
That may be something wrong with me.

330
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:36,360
But only if I'm in front of the keyboard do I know which finger I type the E with by typing something like the T H E and seeing what my finger does.

331
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:48,280
I mean, the moral that's supposed to be, you can't have the skills for taking a stand on your being by coping with things except insofar as there are these things to cope with.

332
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:59,481
You can't put the skill separate from the things in your mind and then ask the question about whether you actually, whether there are actually any things out there.

333
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:06,121
There have to be keyboards and shoelaces, footballs out there if you're going to have skills for coping.

334
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:07,641
Anyway, that's a line.

335
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:10,200
Again, maybe possible paper topping.

336
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:14,121
Okay, I've gotten to a stopping point and nobody said anything.

337
00:37:14,121 --> 00:37:17,560
If you feel like, if you've been repressing saying anything, you should.

338
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:20,121
Because I finished, that's the epistemology part.

339
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:38,760
I've argued that there's got to be an external world, both because you are being in the world, namely openness to a world that you've got no inner, and I've argued there have to be things in that world because you can't cope with, you can't take a stand on your being except in coping with things, and you can't cope with things if there aren't things to cope with.

340
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,521
That's the argument so far.

341
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:41,161
Yeah.

342
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:46,440
That's right.

343
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:57,641
If you're a little you aren't dash on yet, I think that's epistemology that you can try and successful with the idea of trying to solve this mystery of how people do it.

344
00:37:57,961 --> 00:38:00,840
No, I think that's an important and interesting mystery.

345
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,200
And I was funny that you should mention it.

346
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,161
I was going to come around to it in the second, in the ontology part.

347
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:14,401
But I don't think that traditional philosophy has a sense of what that mystery is.

348
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,280
So, and I don't think that epistemology can deal with it or ontology.

349
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:20,561
I don't think anybody can deal with it.

350
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,081
But keep the mystery under your hat for a while.

351
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:25,040
Yeah.

352
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,641
You've given the example of like some false in other stones or separately.

353
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,320
Yeah, people get annoyed at me for thinking that, but I do, yeah.

354
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:50,400
Anybody who's talking about quality, does it reason for this that maybe it's even vulnerable phenomenon without sort of modern thought that would start with the inner or that?

355
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,240
Well, you see, you're you're stating the question and not answering it.

356
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,320
The question then becomes, and why did modern thought get into this peculiar thing?

357
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,361
Which it's true, I grant you, and that's important.

358
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,881
I think that this issue wouldn't even make sense to the people in Bali, for instance.

359
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:15,200
And that's just another way of saying it's very peculiar that our culture has got itself in this frame of mind of thinking there's an inner and an outer.

360
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:23,281
And now the question is: how did we ever, how did people, what about people enable Descartes to come up with this and con them into it?

361
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,880
That's still the question.

362
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:36,241
I don't know whether that's a deep, important, interesting question, or just a crazy question, but since Heidegger asks it and answers it so badly, it seems to me it's a challenge to think about.

363
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,881
Yeah.

364
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:38,001
Dave.

365
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:40,720
Okay, you.

366
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:52,081
Okay.

367
00:39:52,081 --> 00:40:09,961
And so the way that we thought is the main thing only in terms that we were promoted towards thinking about things as substances, that's not material.

368
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:27,640
Okay, but why are we thinking well, okay, that's half the answer, but it's the wrong half, I think, because you told us, it's not a bad half, but I mean, one wants to know why we think that reality is substances.

369
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:32,601
This is sort of a question for Aristotle, and your answer is probably okay.

370
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:36,441
I mean, it's in our grammar, Nietzsche would say.

371
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:38,360
And that's what you're saying, too.

372
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:55,400
But my question right now, Heidegger's question right now, isn't why do we think of the stuff out there as substances, but why do we think that there's something in our head, which is our experience, which has to get outside of our head and relate to those substances that are out there?

373
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:01,960
Why can't we just be open minds, open heads turned toward the world, which I think we probably were for Aristotle's heart?

374
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,081
I can tell.

375
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:21,881
I mean, that seems to then, well, how do we get talked out of the idea that we can experience substances directly and get the idea that we have in our minds a representation of the world, which has to be connected up with the world?

376
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,641
And you end up a skeptic once you start thinking that way.

377
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:27,961
I didn't mention skepticism in that way.

378
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:34,040
But I mean, even Searle thinks that skepticism is a valid position.

379
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:40,441
It's just that we don't need to worry about it because we can just assume that there's a world and we all share this assumption.

380
00:41:40,441 --> 00:41:58,320
But it follows if you think that the mind is the self-sufficient center of intentionality and the world are these substances out there, then you've got the problem of the external world and you've got skepticism because then the question is, well, how in the world do you know that there's any world out there?

381
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,320
All you've got access to is the experiences in here.

382
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:06,321
Well, before you know, somebody else who hadn't said something, yeah.

383
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,680
Descartes turns to you, Lord, what do you mean?

384
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:24,960
Yes, you're right.

385
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:34,561
That when Descartes gets there by trying to convince you that all the stuff that you thought you were directly experienced, you can doubt.

386
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:38,161
And finally, even up to the point where it could all be a dream.

387
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:45,041
But what you can't doubt is what you've definitely got in your head, in your mind, and that's the dream.

388
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:54,640
And then he discovers that there's no reason to believe anything else is out there more really than dreams, and dreams aren't out there.

389
00:42:54,961 --> 00:43:02,241
Yeah, there's all that moves being made by way of demanding certainty.

390
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:14,720
And it's true that we don't have certainty about anything particular in the world except through this kind of skill certainty, which I think is interesting.

391
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:34,120
But I don't, but again, you're not answering my question: is why did people let themselves be convinced that just because sometimes we dream, that it we could never have any direct access to the world, but only access to our private experiences.

392
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:38,760
I mean, that's a big jump, and it's an interesting jump, and people are still sort of debating it.

393
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:53,081
The argument from illusion and so forth, where it looks like sometimes there is something in our mind which doesn't correspond to what we have experienced, sometimes we don't correspond to anything.

394
00:43:53,081 --> 00:44:01,720
Now, if you once say, and you mean in our mind doesn't correspond to anything out there, you're on the way to this.

395
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:10,920
But the question is, how do you let that move talk you out of the Heidegger view that we are the world existingly?

396
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:15,320
Okay, I don't want to spend too long on this, but I'm glad to let people tell me what they think.

397
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,720
Yeah.

398
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,640
He doesn't have to expand it.

399
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:38,841
I mean, it isn't as if Heidegger wants to expand the notion of the external world, for instance, or reality to stuff being out there.

400
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:51,081
He's asking, if you start with the phenomenon, you get this openness to the world and no sense when we're most engaged that there's anything going on in here at all.

401
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:52,761
I'll have to say something about that in a minute.

402
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,040
Going on in here is funny.

403
00:44:54,041 --> 00:45:06,920
But anyway, so Heidegger's trying to ask how we ever shrink our rich relation to reality to this minimal, all we've got is a representation in our heads.

404
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:08,361
Let me say a word about that.

405
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:30,481
Because it's often, and it happens to me too, you can begin to believe the in-your-head story if you think about that it's your brain that's in your head, and something has definitely got to go on in your brain, in your brain, which is in your head, for you to be able to see the chairs and the people out there.

406
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:38,321
And I suspect lots of you really think that that's why this issue still makes sense and epistemology still makes sense.

407
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,640
But notice that somebody like Dretzky is not saying it's in his brain.

408
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:45,761
He's saying, and this is so ambiguous, in his head.

409
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:58,961
What he really means is in his mind, because whatever's going on in the brain is a physical sort of thing, and all kinds of neurons are sending messages back and forth, and nobody understands how it works.

410
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:03,200
But whatever it is, it's not a story about our experience.

411
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,120
And this whole issue is about our experience.

412
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:11,440
How does our experience of objects guarantee that there are any objects?

413
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:13,441
How does our experience of the world...

414
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:19,601
So when somebody like Dretzky says it's in his head, he's not talking about the brain.

415
00:46:19,601 --> 00:46:25,361
That's not what anybody in the epistemology business or the ontology business is talking about.

416
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:38,320
Because nobody, let me repeat it, doubts that there's a brain in your head and that there's stuff going on which in some loose sense at least corresponds to your having an experience of people and chairs.

417
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:52,881
But it's not, it won't be an answer to the epistemological question if somebody starts telling you sort of which neurons are firing when you're seeing this or that thing in the external world.

418
00:46:54,161 --> 00:47:10,761
It's the external world is external to your mind, not your brain, and the internal world is your private experiences, not the firing, which may have some interesting relation to the firing of neurons, but that's not what the question is about.

419
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,760
Now, yeah, Tyler.

420
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:45,320
Well, that's, I mean, that no, Heidegger doesn't think about it because you just have to get that you still could raise the question about the other people.

421
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:52,761
I mean, it does, how do we know that there are other people if all we really know is that there is the experiences of other people in our mind?

422
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,081
This is a much more fundamental question.

423
00:47:55,081 --> 00:48:07,401
It may be that you could make a case, probably somebody has, that it became easier to believe this Descartes story when certain economic things happened.

424
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:09,241
I don't know.

425
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,041
But once you see it, it's a philosophical question.

426
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:30,361
And telling you that it's caused by the brain or caused by the economic conditions is just irrelevant to the, I think, to the philosophical question that comes up as soon as you think the internal and the external.

427
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,641
And I don't see how you can.

428
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,560
One last thing, and then I want to go back to this.

429
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:33,960
Yeah.

430
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,441
Yes.

431
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:48,001
Yes.

432
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,001
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you went too fast.

433
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,001
Metaphors have a neurological basis in the mind.

434
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:16,720
What is that?

435
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,920
Well, what could that do?

436
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:19,200
How could that help?

437
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,121
I'm sure that when you have a metaphor, there are certain neurons firing.

438
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:24,641
So what?

439
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,521
Yeah?

440
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:42,001
Well, I don't I don't I don't believe it.

441
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:43,040
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

442
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:43,760
I don't think so.

443
00:49:43,760 --> 00:50:08,480
I mean, if Heidegger's phenomenology is right, even if I believe the metaphor that it's all going on in my brain or in my mind as a container, that doesn't help get rid of, well, there is still the phenomenon, namely that I'm seeing things out there, that the idea of the inner doesn't doesn't doesn't doesn't get a grip on my experience, Heidegger wants to say.

444
00:50:08,481 --> 00:50:20,001
If you just describe the phenomenon, now it may be that this metaphor has a lot of grip on people since Descartes, but it hasn't changed their experience, I think.

445
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:35,241
I mean, I don't think that Descartes, when he was out in the world, was experiencing tables and chairs and people any more than anybody else as inner, but he's got us, he's got a proof based on whoever said this thing about what's you can't be certain of anything.

446
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,320
Now, okay, you are definitely the last.

447
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,481
I have to go on, but go ahead.

448
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:43,880
I'm troubled by the counter example.

449
00:50:49,240 --> 00:51:04,361
Even if we don't take like dreams or illusions or misperceptions as a stepping stone takes you a sprint, subject objects in your mind, matter, split, or everything, reality, and so forth.

450
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,961
It still seems like it could be problematic for the evidence that we might exist.

451
00:51:11,961 --> 00:51:13,081
Like the matrix, maybe.

452
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:22,601
That the objects, as I perceive them, don't exist anything, but I think they do.

453
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:29,960
And that even if I develop these skills, I'm not comfortable with interrupting them with anything like close to how they are.

454
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:35,401
My sensation is to say that this is not really relevant, or it's not problematic.

455
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,120
It probably is, but it is for me today.

456
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,720
But it's important.

457
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:59,400
I mean, somebody could write a mail question about Heidegger's view of the Matrix because it's, I mean, the interesting question is whether, regardless of the fact that the person, that there is a brain in a vat, there's also that brain isn't having inner experiences.

458
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:07,321
There's a shared world of people out there that interact and hurt each other and have causal relations and so forth.

459
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:10,841
And the question is something like: but you're on the right track.

460
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:26,480
Could you have a world in which there was being with and coping with things and taking a stand on your own being while some computer was really manipulating your brain and you were really in a vat?

461
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:51,760
I think Heidegger ought to say that the answer is yes, and that he's describing that world and that the people who have epistemological issues about skepticism, and this is where you said that that story isn't even relevant because the issue is going to come up again for what's his name, Neo?

462
00:52:51,760 --> 00:53:02,640
Neo, when he sees a desk, is he having a private experience of the desk or is he sort of just an open-minded answer is, well, his brain is doing something.

463
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:06,960
It's the causal basis of his seeing the desk, but so is my brain doing something.

464
00:53:06,961 --> 00:53:09,441
It's the causal basis of my seeing you.

465
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:13,921
You can still raise the epistemological question inside the matrix, I think.

466
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:16,480
But anyway, that's a great subject for a paper.

467
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:19,120
But you've got to do it in terms of Heidegger.

468
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:21,120
Don't just tell me about the movie.

469
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:22,001
Okay.

470
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,360
Now, I've got to go on, or I'm going to be two days behind.

471
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:29,360
So, and the other one is so interesting and complicated.

472
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:36,081
Oh, but I did want to, no, I'm not quite done, just because I wanted to read some interesting quotes.

473
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:57,841
Oh, yeah, there's this fascinating quote that I can't resist reading, where Heidegger is being, remember, you could say one thing, that we have beliefs about the external world, and that those beliefs might or might not be true, like we have any beliefs about Santa Claus and the moon and so forth.

474
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:04,520
And Wittgenstein and Heidegger both think that it isn't a question of beliefs about the external world.

475
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:10,200
Our relation to the external world isn't a relation between inner and external, and it isn't an external world.

476
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,241
We have practices which engage us with things and people.

477
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:29,001
Once you start thinking that our relation to things and people is that we have beliefs in our mind about them, and you start asking whether the beliefs in our mind are justified or true, you've already, you're lost already.

478
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:42,121
And Heidegger says in his lecture in the history of concept of time on 215: nothing in our relationship to the world provides a basis for the phenomenon of belief in the world.

479
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:45,881
I have not yet been able to find this phenomenon of belief.

480
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:51,881
And I think Wittgenstein says something very similar to that on his book On Certainty.

481
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,080
So you've got to make this move.

482
00:54:55,081 --> 00:55:04,841
So the two things that get in your way when you think about this and push you in the direction of Descartes is bringing in issues about the brain and the matrix and so forth.

483
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:15,001
And the other one is just automatically starting to think about all this about whether our beliefs about the world and about objects in the world are justified or not.

484
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:18,521
It's part of the basic move not to talk about beliefs.

485
00:55:18,521 --> 00:55:20,680
No, I'm sorry we can't because I've got to go on.

486
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,121
I shouldn't have even done that.

487
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:25,961
Okay, we're going to make a transition to the ontological question.

488
00:55:26,441 --> 00:55:29,960
And that's the question of really the question.

489
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:34,040
I just want to tell you so you won't lose track in all because it's very complicated.

490
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:35,960
It's subtle and interesting.

491
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:43,401
The simple question to blur it out is: is there a universe of stuff out there?

492
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:50,320
Well, out there, you're out there now, not outside the mind, but outside our shared world, and maybe outside, it doesn't help any.

493
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,401
Is there a universe?

494
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,840
Yeah, forget the outside.

495
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,081
Is there a universe of stuff?

496
00:55:56,081 --> 00:56:01,680
Galaxies, electrons, quarks, maybe strings, who knows?

497
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:13,680
Utterly independent of us, so that even if Dasein ceased to exist, or even if Don Sign had never existed, there'd still be these entities.

498
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:25,281
So there'd be electrons, and they'd still have a weight, and they still have a spin, and they still have a charge, and it makes it which makes no reference to us whatsoever.

499
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,321
That is what I'm going to call robust realism.

500
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:31,521
I think Heidegger is a robust realist.

501
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,440
I'll try to convince you of that.

502
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:37,601
I'll have maybe 50% success usually.

503
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:49,841
But anyway, the interesting thing is that all we've been saying so far inclines people who read Heidegger to think that he must be some kind of anti-realist.

504
00:56:49,840 --> 00:57:00,961
Namely, think that everything that shows up for us is somehow related to our practices for disclosing things and disclosing a world.

505
00:57:00,961 --> 00:57:09,360
Now, I'm going to, I mean, I have to, I can't help sort of, I don't want to hide my view that that is not what follows.

506
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,720
But I first have to try to convince you that there are lots and lots of people.

507
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:20,081
Bill Blattner that you like and I like so much, and his book is so clear, thinks that Heidegger is, quote, a temporal idealist.

508
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:26,880
Lots of people think that Heidegger is some kind of, well, it's better to say anti-realist.

509
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:37,161
The idealist suggests that Heidegger would think that somehow there is nothing but the world of our experiences and the universe is just another whole big bunch of experiences.

510
00:57:37,161 --> 00:57:40,601
Surely nobody thinks Heidegger's that kind of idealist.

511
00:57:40,601 --> 00:58:03,481
But you could think that Heidegger is an anti-realist of the sort who says we don't ever get obsessed through things as they are in themselves, independent of us and our concerns, and therefore we can't ever say anything about the structure of the universe as it is in itself.

512
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,000
That's okay.

513
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:10,120
Now I'm going to stick to my notes, but I let you keep that in mind.

514
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:13,561
Well, no, I'll say one more thing before we look at the details.

515
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:22,761
The interesting opposite view to Heidegger's is something which I'm calling deflationary realism.

516
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:35,801
It's the view that, of course, all this stuff is independent of me and my mind, and so are chairs and baseballs and electrons.

517
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,961
And they're all independent of us in the same sort of way.

518
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:50,441
And we have this natural ontological commitment to the fact that when we deal with things, we always, I've got this quote here.

519
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:51,480
Where is it?

520
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:03,320
Well, what Arthur Fine, as a typical case, calls the natural ontological attitude.

521
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:13,961
The natural ontological attitude, I made a mistake in my commentary, of falling for it, thinking that Fine was some kind of robust realist, that he's not.

522
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:16,560
He says that we're all realists.

523
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,360
And what kind of realists?

524
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:24,081
Well, we just all believe quite naturally.

525
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:34,321
He says we accept the evidence of our senses with regard to the existence of everyday objects and accept in the same way the results of science.

526
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:39,521
Now, if you're a robust realist, you say, well, no, that's not quite, that can't be right.

527
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:50,001
The baseballs and all this sort of human social stuff depends on us in a way that electrons don't.

528
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:58,321
And there's an important distinction inside this attitude that there are these things independent of us.

529
00:59:58,561 --> 00:59:59,440
Let's see now.

530
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:02,081
I want to find one other quote.

531
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:18,161
So Heidegger says, for instance, it must be stated that the entities are in themselves, this is history of concept of time, 217, independent of any apprehension we have of them.

532
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:20,321
I'm reading it a little bit differently than it is here.

533
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:26,000
Yet the being of the entity is founded on the encounter and made understandable from the.

534
01:00:26,641 --> 01:00:28,161
No, I don't think I want to read that.

535
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:30,481
Now, not that it goes against it, it just doesn't help.

536
01:00:30,481 --> 01:00:32,081
So let's not read that.

537
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:33,440
I'm going to go back to my notes.

538
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:38,720
I keep wanting to sort of blurt out the answer, but if I don't do it step by step, I'll lose you.

539
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:39,520
Okay.

540
01:00:39,760 --> 01:01:00,920
So if Dasein and the meaning of all the objects that Dasein deals with depends on Dasein's disclosing a world, and the world is some kind of what Charles Taylor calls a co-production between Dasein and whatever it is that Dasein is thrown into.

541
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:06,121
There's no place in there for an independent universe.

542
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:24,280
If there was no world of disclosing practices, then we couldn't even make sense of the notion of independent objects or non-independent objects.

543
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:31,321
There would just be a universe of things, and the universe of things would exist whether Dasein existed or not.

544
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,081
What am I saying?

545
01:01:33,081 --> 01:01:34,521
Cancel, I think, what I just said.

546
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:36,760
I'm confusing myself and you.

547
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,881
I see, I said it as a question in my notes.

548
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,080
That is, the world, and okay, no wonder I got confused.

549
01:01:46,200 --> 01:02:03,641
This world seems to be somehow a co-production of us and our skills and our openness and something or other that we're all interacting with and are open to and can get a grip on and so forth.

550
01:02:03,641 --> 01:02:25,401
And now my question was: does that mean that if there were no world of disclosing practices, then we couldn't make sense of independent objects so that the very notion of independent objects depends on us, and it sort of looks like the notion the universe disappears as the present at hand becomes just one way of taking things.

551
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,840
I'll make this clearer.

552
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,761
I swear I will, but I'm not making it very clear yet.

553
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:50,320
So if our background practices is what enables us to encounter things and to make them intelligible, then how can we make intelligible things absolutely independent of us and our encountering them?

554
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,760
Are there any that's this thing again?

555
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,960
Is there a universe?

556
01:02:54,961 --> 01:03:06,001
Are there things in themselves with properties that don't in any way relate to our capacity for disclosing a world and encountering entities?

557
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:10,241
Let me just keep reading this and see if it helps any.

558
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:14,560
You can read the belief system issue the other way.

559
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:21,840
Suppose everything depends on our background practices, all our ways of revealing things and encountering things.

560
01:03:22,161 --> 01:03:40,241
And if that isn't a belief system, but it's our practices, then if it's a belief system, we can then separate our interpretation of the world, our understanding of the world, our understanding of the universe from whatever's out there that either confirms or doesn't.

561
01:03:40,240 --> 01:04:04,001
But if all we've got are these practices which we can't get clear about, which are our forehaving, and we're always in the hermeneutic circle, that is, we've always got a whole way of relating to the world and to other people and stuff in our behavior, and we can't turn it into a belief system, and we can't get clear about it.

562
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:06,720
Therefore, we can't sort of bracket it.

563
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:19,281
So we can't know how much of the world that we think is out there and is independent of us and the universe is in any way the way we think it is, because we don't know how much we're contributing.

564
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:25,280
This is the way it begins to look if you go a certain way with Heidegger.

565
01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:38,761
We must be somehow reading our background understanding, our interpretation into everything, everything we discover and everything we disclose, so we can't discover anything as it really is.

566
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:44,041
That we're getting more and more into some kind of non-robust realism, so anti-realism.

567
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:48,600
There is no such thing, this is the crucial phrase, if you're getting lost, keep this in mind.

568
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:53,881
Is there any such thing as pure discovering and the pure present at hand?

569
01:04:53,880 --> 01:05:05,001
It looks like to the anti-realists reading Heidegger, and to anti-realists anyway, that there is no pure discovering and there is no pure present at hand.

570
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:10,521
It's all within our practices, within our forehaving.

571
01:05:10,521 --> 01:05:14,841
And then that seems to lead to anti-realism.

572
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:19,081
And now the question is: where's Heidegger in all this?

573
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:36,361
Okay, so I think, I used to think, and in my commentary, I think, and you should be wary if you read this chapter in the comments, that Heidegger believes that there are things in themselves utterly independent of our practices, even though we don't know what our practices are.

574
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:45,001
We can nonetheless get out of all of our practices and have pure discovery of the pure present at hand.

575
01:05:45,001 --> 01:05:47,161
I used to think that.

576
01:05:47,161 --> 01:05:49,080
I still think that's what he believes.

577
01:05:49,081 --> 01:05:52,521
But now I have to give you some guidelines that I learned the hard way.

578
01:05:52,521 --> 01:05:56,921
That's not what he believes in the chapter on reality that you've just been reading.

579
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:03,401
That's what he believes back on page 408 when he does his story about science, which we'll come to next time.

580
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:21,601
Remember, I told you you read some funny number, some funny page numbers that I, just in case you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm talking about page 412, what he calls the existential conception of science, from 412 to 415.

581
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:34,081
There, I think, he shows you how you can be a realist about science, which and that science can give you pure discovery and tell you about the present at hand in the universe.

582
01:06:34,081 --> 01:06:39,361
However, the part we're reading, I think, is deflationary realism.

583
01:06:39,360 --> 01:07:30,321
I think this whole section on realism we get here is telling you that there's something like this natural ontological attitude in which you take it that you are coping with things as they are in themselves, where that means independent of what you think they are, independent of whether you're handling them or not, independent of how they look to you, that Heidegger thinks that in a kind of minimum but very important sense, you can always, we are, because we are this kind of openness on the world, we always disclose the world as things are, in some sense of in themselves.

584
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:51,041
Now, this looks puzzling, and I'm not sure this is right, but I tried very hard in writing the commentary to show that in the section on reality, Heidegger really meant by things in themselves the universe of entities that have no relation to us whatsoever.

585
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:52,560
And I think that's just wrong.

586
01:07:52,560 --> 01:08:04,840
He thinks that this is a thing in itself, that things in themselves, the way Heidegger is sort of defusing the term in itself, so that we are open to things as they are in themselves.

587
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:07,880
If that's true, then you see what you get.

588
01:08:07,881 --> 01:08:12,600
Electrons and baseballs are the same ontologically.

589
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:21,161
They are the kind of entities independent of each of us and independent of each of our particular views about them.

590
01:08:21,721 --> 01:08:23,640
Here's a way to think about it.

591
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,320
And I think it helps a lot.

592
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:31,720
I'm going to put you through what happened between me and Searle about this about 10 years ago, or maybe 20 now.

593
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:37,480
I think Searle wants to be a robust realist.

594
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:43,001
And he fell into deflationary realism.

595
01:08:43,001 --> 01:08:55,161
And Heidegger, I think, is happy to be a deflationary realist about the everyday world, but he's a robust realist about the universe.

596
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:58,520
Now, let me tell you what happened with Searle.

597
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:16,520
So Searle has this interesting view that he's, and you may have, how many of them you tell me if you've heard him talk about this, that we represent things as being some way or other, but it depends on the things themselves, whether there are any such things.

598
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:22,360
So we represent mountains, and then there may be mountains and there may not be mountains.

599
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:28,360
And he's a realist because he thinks that the representation card is in our mind and up to us.

600
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:37,400
But whether there are any things that satisfy any of our representations is up to the world.

601
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,560
And that sounds good.

602
01:09:39,560 --> 01:10:00,960
And I think that's something like what Heidegger thinks in this chapter wants to defend in this chapter, only not in terms of inner and outer, the way Searle would put it, but in terms of we have a whole referential totality, and we have a way of turning things into present at hand, and all of that is something that we can do.

603
01:10:00,961 --> 01:10:05,360
And when we do, then things show up for us or they don't.

604
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:11,360
And whether they do or they don't is not up to us, up to our representations.

605
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,001
We can represent hammers, and then maybe there are some hammers, and maybe there aren't any hammers.

606
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:21,520
We can represent Santa Clauses, turns out there aren't any, at least so I've been told.

607
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:43,280
And therefore, so it looks like Searle's got a nice distinction in which you can be a robust realist about everything insofar as you make this distinction between what we represent, like mountains, and whether there are any independent of our representation, mountains or not.

608
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:52,560
But when Searle told me this, my reaction, I wasn't trying to be difficult, was to say, yeah, but that's okay for mountains, but what about money?

609
01:10:52,560 --> 01:11:01,360
When you represent something as money, it's true that whether I have any dollar in my pocket or not doesn't depend on me.

610
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,800
And there's this kind of realism.

611
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:05,600
This is again this basic deflationary realism.

612
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:08,720
I can ask whether there really is a dollar in my pocket.

613
01:11:08,721 --> 01:11:12,161
And there really is, and there really isn't, and it's not up to me.

614
01:11:12,161 --> 01:11:18,960
But new complication is that what it is to be a dollar is up to me.

615
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:39,640
And now that, and that lets in a new problem about independent reality, because it now looks like all we've ever got is our understanding of what it is to be a hammer, and then we can find out whether there are any hammers.

616
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:48,840
Our understanding of what it is to be an electron, and then we can find out whether there are any electrons, and our understanding of what it is to be a baseball, and we can find out whether there are any baseballs.

617
01:11:48,841 --> 01:12:05,320
But now you level the distinction between what is dependent on our definition of it, baseballs and money, and what is independent of our definition of it, electrons and galaxies.

618
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:23,001
And if you're not careful, you just, it's very difficult not to turn, start to go into anti-realism because it looks like, and now here's the way to put it, it looks like we just group things in the world according to our own interests.

619
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:29,081
It isn't as if we have, I mean, we pick out something and call it a mountain.

620
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:35,560
From the point of view of a great, great big Martian landing, they would be just molehills.

621
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:44,921
And it's, and so it looks like everything, well, there's a good phrase for this in a philosopher named Ian Hawking.

622
01:12:44,921 --> 01:12:48,440
I'm going to talk more about Hacking so I can write that on the board.

623
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:59,320
He's a good philosopher of science, and he talks about functionally relevant groupings.

624
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:07,161
That is, we group things into objects relative to our interests.

625
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:13,320
The dramatic example, and I don't know if he's the first to use it, is some constellations.

626
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,320
Constellations have a very special thing.

627
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:23,360
I mean, there are constellations, all right, and people have seen them for thousands and thousands of years, but there's nothing in the universe there.

628
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:29,360
It's just a relevant grouping to us who like to see things in the sky.

629
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:39,041
And maybe everything that we think is, so we group them into galaxies and we group them into electrons and we group them into baseballs.

630
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:43,440
All that's really there is something, sort of malleable chaos.

631
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,480
This is Nietzsche's view.

632
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,200
I only recognize this just from the Nietzsche course.

633
01:13:47,681 --> 01:13:52,320
There's chaos and then we, in terms of our interest, impose order on it.

634
01:13:52,320 --> 01:14:07,680
And now it looks like Searle's story doesn't keep us from, doesn't get us out of that, because it says, you know, we make these representations of mountains and baseballs and games like chess.

635
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:12,800
We define things as the queen, and then we can find out whether there are any.

636
01:14:12,801 --> 01:14:17,520
But all of that is relevant to us in our grouping.

637
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,360
We don't find out what's true about the universe.

638
01:14:22,881 --> 01:14:26,320
And we've leveled baseballs and electrons.

639
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,520
That's the question.

640
01:14:27,841 --> 01:14:35,200
And I think Searle realized and wrote a great book about the nature of social reality, of money.

641
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:48,081
But the moral is that that argument between what we represent and whether there's anything out there like that doesn't get you robust realism.

642
01:14:48,081 --> 01:15:04,840
Because what we represent may all be relevant to our practices, relative to our interests, and finding out whether there's anything like that is only anything like that, insofar as there's anything like a constellation.

643
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:07,800
It doesn't prove that it's there independent.

644
01:15:07,801 --> 01:15:26,200
So now, what happens is then, interestingly enough, what happens with Searle, as I far as I can see, is he just decides he's going to be a robust realist by saying nobody in their right mind nowadays, given the modern world and science, could be anything but a robust realist.

645
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,920
That really are electrons, period.

646
01:15:28,921 --> 01:15:31,081
But the argument is gone.

647
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:41,640
If all you do is think you can make it by distinguishing your representation and whether what's really there, because your representation may be carving up what's really there.

648
01:15:41,961 --> 01:15:43,720
So, where am I now?

649
01:15:43,721 --> 01:15:51,240
So, Searle's telling you that I'm just skimming this.

650
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:57,880
So, Searle just says they're brutal facts, period, and they're studied by science, period.

651
01:15:57,881 --> 01:16:01,240
What I think is you need an argument for something like that.

652
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,840
And he hasn't got it.

653
01:16:02,841 --> 01:16:11,161
And I don't know whether Heidegger's got it, but I'm going to try to show you that Heidegger at least thinks he's got it, or at least thinks that he ought to have it.

654
01:16:11,161 --> 01:16:30,280
That is, the question is whether you can make a distinction between the way of being of stuff in the universe, like electrons, let me repeat, whose structure and existence is totally independent of us and what interests us.

655
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:36,440
And what, and uh it's just, electrons are just the way they are, and so forth.

656
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,680
Well, can you distinguish that?

657
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:42,920
And then you would have pure discovering when you disc when you talked about electrons.

658
01:16:42,921 --> 01:16:44,921
And they would be pure present at hand.

659
01:16:45,520 --> 01:17:00,480
Or is everything relative to us grouping things in like hammers in the referential totality relative to our purposes and our stand on our being and so forth?

660
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:21,280
And I'm going to start next time with trying to show first, just very quickly, how the chapter on realism is deflationary realism because nowhere in there does he talk about the universe as independent of our knowing it.

661
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:26,320
He wants to say everything is independent of our coping and our knowing it.

662
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:39,360
And then I want to show how when he gets to that chapter about the existential, the existential nature of science and theory, he comes up with what's still supposed to be an argument for independent universe.

663
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,720
I see one hand up.

664
01:17:40,721 --> 01:17:43,840
I think we have one, we have two minutes.

665
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,360
Well, you're right.

666
01:18:00,001 --> 01:18:04,161
I think what you're saying is something I was sort of skirting around and almost saying.

667
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:10,240
The inner in your mind corresponding to the external world is dump.

668
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,240
That goes with epistemology.

669
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:23,440
But there's something about how, can we make a distinction between what shows up in the world for us and what is, so to speak, out there in the universe?

670
01:18:24,001 --> 01:18:26,001
That distinction is okay.

671
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:28,161
I mean, at least it hasn't, nothing wrong.

672
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:31,720
We're not saying, you know, we have access to our private experiences.

673
01:18:31,721 --> 01:18:34,121
How do we ever know there are chairs and people?

674
01:18:29,921 --> 01:18:35,880
We say we've got a world.

675
01:18:36,121 --> 01:18:45,640
We understand how the world is all carved up and experienced relative to our referential whole and our stands that we take on ourselves.

676
01:18:45,640 --> 01:19:00,680
Is there also, so to speak, outside of that world or beyond that world or external to that world, a universe of stuff that is totally independent of us and our interests?

677
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:01,480
That's okay.

678
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:05,001
That doesn't fall into the epistemological mess.

679
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,600
Okay, I have to stop.

680
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,800
Time's up.
