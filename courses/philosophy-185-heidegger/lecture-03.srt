00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,240
An important distinction for those particularly who know philosophy, and even more particularly for those who know Kant, is that Heidegger wants to make a distinction between what he calls the categories.

2
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:18,799
This is on page 70, page 44 of the German, and the existentials.

3
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:22,560
And the now let's start with the categories.

4
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:31,919
Starting with Aristotle, Aristotle tried to list the properties of all objects just insofar as they were objects.

5
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:41,280
They had causal relations, they were at some place, they were at some time, they had properties, and so forth.

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,639
And he gave a kind of grab bag list of categories that were the properties of objects.

7
00:00:48,639 --> 00:01:08,039
And then Kant, being very thorough and German and architectonic, listed them as twelve categories and put them into four subclasses of three each, and each of those three were related to each other, and said that they were the structure of objects in general.

8
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:13,959
And there was causality and substance and relation and quantity and quality and so forth on the list.

9
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,240
Now, Heidegger goes along with that.

10
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:27,160
When he's going to talk about categories, he's perfectly happy to talk about the categories as the general structure of substances.

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:36,520
He won't like to call them objects, I keep saying, because that's a Descartes interpretation of what it is to be a substance, and it goes with being a subject and so forth.

12
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
But let's say substances.

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,080
So categories are the general structure of substances.

14
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,479
And on page 70, he says that somewhere.

15
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,199
At least so.

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,199
Oh, I'm looking at the German numbers instead of the.

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,799
Here we go.

18
00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:01,640
So he talks about, I'll just read the beginning of that paragraph, second sentence.

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,600
Because Dasein's characters of being are defined in terms of existentiality, we call them existentialia.

20
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,239
I haven't got to that yet, but that's the next thing.

21
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:20,760
These are to be sharply distinguished from what we call categories, characteristics of being for entities whose character is not that of Dasein.

22
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,319
It's really characteristic of beings, that is, entities.

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,760
Or it could be general characteristics.

24
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,479
It doesn't matter.

25
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,080
We're not going to worry about that.

26
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,840
It doesn't affect anything we're interested in.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,640
What's interesting is the existentialia.

28
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,720
Here's a trick question.

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,760
If the categories are the structure of objects, what would you expect the existentialia to be?

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,720
Well, I mean, I've warned you it's a trick question.

31
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,600
I mean, it looks like if you knew Kant, you'd say, well, they're the general structure of subjects, or Descartes.

32
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,520
And after all, but I've already said Heidegger wouldn't be saying that.

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:13,760
So the existentialia are not, even though the categories are the structure of objects roughly or substances, the existentialia are characteristics of what?

34
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,879
Of us.

35
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,879
And we're not present at hand, substances.

36
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,640
We're not substances at all.

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,239
Our way of being is existence, and we talked about that.

38
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
Now, somebody had a hand up already about that.

39
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:26,960
No?

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,600
Okay.

41
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,240
So that's got to be talked about at some point, but not necessarily, but I don't have anything more.

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,640
There's nothing more you need to say about it.

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,400
It's so, well, I'll tell you one more thing about it.

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,400
It's a sort of problem for Heidegger because he doesn't really know where to put equipment.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,919
Where would you put something which is not a substance, which is holistic and has aspects?

46
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,400
We talked about that when we talked about hammers.

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,240
We did talk about hammers already, didn't we?

48
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,840
I want to make sure.

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,119
Okay, and so it really hammers don't fit very well.

50
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:15,759
They certainly aren't substances self-sufficient with self-sufficient properties, but they certainly, hammers are not, as far as I know, concerned about their being and taking a stand on their being either.

51
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,280
So Heidegger's got to stick them in one place or the other.

52
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:30,879
So he defines, he says, well, categories are the general properties of anything that isn't a Dasein and throws them into the category place.

53
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:45,800
I think that's a mistake because I think categories ought to be for self-sufficient substances, and I think that you just need another name for the general characteristic of substances, of equipment, and Heidegger just doesn't have it.

54
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,840
I mean, he's got a name for the way of being of equipment.

55
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,039
You hopefully all know that by now, namely readiness to hand.

56
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:58,679
But he hasn't got a name for what you would want to say something a lot.

57
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,600
He has lots of things to say about the general structure of equipment.

58
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,039
We may get there today, and we'll certainly spend a lot of time on that next time.

59
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:12,520
And it was a major part of what you were supposed to be reading for this week up to page what is 102, I think.

60
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,039
Well, I don't have it handy.

61
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,679
What is it?

62
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,559
Anybody got a syllabus?

63
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,119
I think it's.

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,840
I was trying to.

65
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,079
104, something like that.

66
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,559
Okay.

67
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,280
Now, so let me go back then, having jumped to the end, and started where I want to start.

68
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:42,280
And that is to remind you where we are after a big break that we've mostly been talking about the three modes of being.

69
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,600
So that this was a kind of review to talk about categories and existentials.

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:06:02,200
The three modes of being, of substances whose way of being is presence at hand, of equipment, whose way of being is readiness to hand, and of us, whose way of being is existence, meaning taking a stand on its being.

71
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,279
That's, I take it, done.

72
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,040
I mean, w we've I hope I've covered it enough and that we just can now take it for granted.

73
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,200
But what we haven't covered enough, and it's going to be abstract for a while.

74
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,000
This is going to be a funny lecture if it goes off the way I've written it down.

75
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,119
We and that depends on what kind of questions you guys ask.

76
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:25,119
But in general, it starts out, I'm afraid, very abstract.

77
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:34,000
And if you don't get that, it does, don't worry about it, because it's the issues that come up in the introduction and the introduction I want to come back to at the end.

78
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:43,920
But I have to say something about being at the beginning so that you can see why Heidegger's saying what he's saying and where he's heading.

79
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:51,200
And then it suddenly becomes very concrete, and he has detailed things to say about hammering.

80
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,320
But so, what do the three modes of being had in common?

81
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,399
Well, first you want to get out of the way, wrong ways.

82
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,720
That's one reason I have to talk about it.

83
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:11,840
Once upon a time, in fact, up to Heidegger, whatever it was about being, it was always about substances.

84
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:20,000
So the modes of being would be different kinds of substances, numbers and God and trees and people.

85
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:24,560
But the answer what made them all beings was they were all substances.

86
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
And that's certainly not Heidegger's line.

87
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:35,600
Another way people thought of being that Heidegger doesn't care for is that it's what he calls beingness.

88
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,080
That would be the most general property.

89
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,560
But it had the general property of everything, or at least the most general property of what's present at hand.

90
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:53,839
But probably it, I mean, when people talk about beingness, they've got to include numbers and artworks and things that don't fall under presence at hand.

91
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,520
But Heidegger's not going to talk about beingness either.

92
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:17,000
And the main reason I'm saying all this is to get you out of the third possible mistake, which you were lured into by something very, very bad about this translation, but it's typical of most Heidegger translations, that you get being with a capital B.

93
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:27,080
You should, I mean, I hate to tell you to sort of constantly be marking up your books, but in your mind, at least, whenever you see being, you have to see it with a lowercase B.

94
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:45,880
Just as there are lots of other things, mistakes that run through it that I'll point out as I go, that you just don't, but when you hand in your papers, put being in lowercase B in the quotes to show that you've understood that you're not supposed to slavishly believe the translation.

95
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:51,320
You're supposed to believe me, or if not me, Heidegger, but certainly not the people.

96
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,359
And why would they even think that being had a capital B?

97
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,920
Well, two wrong reasons.

98
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:03,319
One, people think of God as the supreme being and write it with a capital G.

99
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,800
And I suppose when you write supreme being, I don't know, do you write it with a capital B?

100
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,159
Do you know, Dave?

101
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,000
I suppose.

102
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,399
But that's wrong.

103
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,559
Being isn't something with a capital B.

104
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,040
It isn't like Plato's the good, and it isn't the supreme being.

105
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,920
And so we've got to drop that.

106
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:30,680
And all of these modes of being had something to do with what made the world intelligible to us.

107
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,160
I mean, you can see it most clearly with God as the supreme being.

108
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:45,720
He made the world completely intelligible by making it to us the kind of beings whose mind was exactly adapted to the way the creation was made.

109
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,119
Yeah.

110
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,000
That's good you asked.

111
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:50,479
It's funny.

112
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:53,359
I forgot to say a sentence and you just asked for it.

113
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:58,880
Yeah, there is, it's, the word in German for being is sein, S-E-I-N.

114
00:09:58,879 --> 00:09:59,840
Very simple.

115
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,800
And it's always capitalized in German.

116
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,640
Now, because all nouns are capitalized in German.

117
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,479
So chair is also with a capital C, but people don't go around thinking of the supreme chair.

118
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:23,680
But they somehow, as soon as they see a capital B, even though it's just the word sein, and the capital is doing no job, they equate it with some super being.

119
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
So and so that's the answer.

120
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:38,960
There is nothing, you're perfectly okay to use being for the supreme being if you believe in the supreme being with a capital B, but nothing in German sort of supports that or opposes it either.

121
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,079
Is that all clear?

122
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:56,960
I mean, just so it's just important to understand that whatever being is, and I haven't told you yet, and it's hard to get sure what, it's whatever all these three have in common, it's not going to be some entity, some super entity like the supreme being.

123
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,559
And what is it then?

124
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:09,360
Well, Heidegger defines being sort of in passing, not as if he was really giving you a big deal definition, but it's the best you can get because he doesn't do it anywhere else.

125
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:16,080
And that's that the bottom of 25, which is page 6 of the German.

126
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,680
Did I read this already?

127
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,359
I did, I think.

128
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:22,560
Okay, I'm reading, I'm going to read it again just because it's important.

129
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:33,960
So he talks about being is that on the basis of which, it's the very, very bottom, that's this Worldf Hin, entities are already understood.

130
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,600
And that is, now we can say something.

131
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,560
Uh-oh.

132
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,400
I think I can do mine.

133
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,399
There.

134
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,760
It's on, isn't it?

135
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,800
I can see whether it's on.

136
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:52,680
So.

137
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,680
Okay.

138
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:08,840
So whatever being is, it's got to do with what you could call intelligibility.

139
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:17,239
It is that on the basis of which everything that we deal with makes sense or is intelligible to us.

140
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:30,120
That is, we, substances are intelligible to us, and so there, and the understanding that goes with that, the understanding of being that goes with that is readiness to hand.

141
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,520
And sorry, presence at hand.

142
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,759
Equipment is intelligible because we can understand its way of being readiness to hand.

143
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:46,040
And we're intelligible because we have a kind of being which is dedicated to making sense of ourselves.

144
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:54,600
So it looks like being is something like the most general properties of things that they're intelligible.

145
00:12:55,239 --> 00:13:02,200
But that's a tricky thing because intelligible is not some general property.

146
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:10,679
It's a kind of holistic, I don't know what, characteristic, or it is something.

147
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:17,880
I mean, a property, remember, is sort of independent of other properties and therefore not all interrelated.

148
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:27,280
Whereas Heidegger's going to argue that nothing that we cope with is intelligible except in connection with a whole lot of other stuff we cope with.

149
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:36,239
And intelligibility is this, you just can't find any word for it.

150
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:39,920
I mean, besides being, I want to say it's this basic feature of everything.

151
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
The feature is a very bad thing to say.

152
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,279
It's a property of everything.

153
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,479
Well, that's taken over and reserved too by Aristotle.

154
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:52,639
It's an aspect of things, no, although that might be a little closer because aspects would be holistic.

155
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,080
It's just that things make sense to us.

156
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,200
That's intelligibility.

157
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:12,159
And it's the capacity to make sense of things, which is finally whatever being is, it is.

158
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,560
Now sorry, that's two things.

159
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,840
We've got the capacity to make sense of things, and Heidegger calls that our understanding of being.

160
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,639
Being is just the things are intelligible, that they make sense.

161
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,719
And then that's about all you can say about it.

162
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:36,399
Except it turns out there's something, one more thing that's very important you can say about it.

163
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,840
And that's that it's the Borauf Hin.

164
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,080
It's being is that on the basis of which beings are understood.

165
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,840
And that means, and that's what I want to talk about, and I said it has to be sort of abstract.

166
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,039
Being is the background.

167
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:01,119
That's the it's it's something that is has to be in place for anything to be intelligible.

168
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:06,679
But it's not what we're thinking about when we're dealing or when we're thinking about things and dealing with them.

169
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,519
It stays in it's a cup it's some it's what we can understand by coping with things.

170
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,600
We understand equipment and its way of being and so forth.

171
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:33,959
And that kind of understanding that enables us to tell the difference, so to speak, from substances to equipment, people, we see their different kinds of being because we have this understanding in the background.

172
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,199
And how and where is it in the background?

173
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,840
Well, it's in our practices.

174
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,040
We are able to deal with substances, equipment, and people.

175
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,919
It sounds on the one hand very abstract, and on the other hand, very concrete.

176
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,679
We know how to pick up hammers.

177
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:57,560
We don't talk to them and scold them if they hit our fingers because that's not appropriate part to the understanding of hammers.

178
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,239
We know how to deal with people with us.

179
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,479
We know how to deal with substances.

180
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,600
And that know-how is in the background whenever we deal with anything.

181
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,040
And that's as close to being as you can get in Heidegger.

182
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,679
Yeah.

183
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,879
Well, I say it's a relation in the sense that things are always intelligible with respect to us understanding them.

184
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,600
That's right.

185
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Remember I quoted that strange phrase, being depends on us, though the beings don't.

186
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,999
And that's because intelligibility depends on us, but not hammers or stars.

187
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:46,919
But we have the practices and the skills for making sense of hammers and stars, and by knowing how to deal with them.

188
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,639
That's all hard to talk about.

189
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,359
And you'll see in a minute that Heidegger knows it's hard, and everybody knows it's hard.

190
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:55,359
But let's see if I've got what I want.

191
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:14,480
And on the basis of which I take to being that it's always there in the background these coping skills, whenever we do any hammering or look at any substances or worry about or just take a stand on who we are.

192
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:27,840
And later Heidegger's going to call this background know-how our familiarity.

193
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,280
We'll come back to that.

194
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,279
We are familiar with hammers and substances and people.

195
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,439
That familiarity is another, one of his names for this characteristic.

196
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:55,920
And since Dasein is the basis on which we make sense of all modes of being, we get back to fundamental ontology, which we already talked about last time, I think, didn't we?

197
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
It's been so long, I can't remember for sure.

198
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,840
But okay, and that was the top of 34.

199
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,840
The fundamental ontology, from which alone all other ontologies can take their rise, must be sought in the existential analytic of Dasein.

200
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:26,879
If Dasein is the being that understands beings, that is the source of intelligence, if Dasein is the source of intelligibility of every sort of being, then to do fundamental ontology, you've got to understand what Dasein and how he does that.

201
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,119
And that's what we're going to talk about now.

202
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:46,279
How does Dasein work or become or do the job of being the background on the basis of which all sorts of beings are understood, whether they're tables or rocks or people, it doesn't matter.

203
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,960
Dasein does it.

204
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,359
And it does it.

205
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,359
And I said this, but I have to stress it.

206
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,919
We understand things by coping with them, according to Heidegger, not by thinking about them.

207
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,560
Or, well, period.

208
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:06,840
That would be the other alternative, that we understand them by having beliefs about them and what you can do with them.

209
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,119
You could have beliefs about what equipment is and what you can do with it and what you can't do with it.

210
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,519
And we do have beliefs about it.

211
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,119
But basically, we just deal with it.

212
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:24,919
And in our dealings, is already an understanding of what it is to be equipment, for instance.

213
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,560
So now I want to talk about that for a while.

214
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:44,999
So first I want to read you something because I said the understanding of being is for Heidegger the way we provide a background for making sense of Erbrigg thing.

215
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:54,679
And the best quote on that, and Heidegger, by understanding, doesn't mean anything cognitive, it doesn't mean anything thinking.

216
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:02,840
I keep using the phrase know-how, but we've now got to actually make clear what that is.

217
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:22,399
At the top of 28, which is the German 8, he says, right at the top of 28, being arises from the average understanding of being in which we always operate and which in the end belongs to the essential constitution of Dasein.

218
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,719
That's what I'm trying to explain now.

219
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,879
So intelligibility arises from our understanding.

220
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:29,359
How?

221
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,919
Well, again, not by what we think, but by, I hope I have a, yeah, here I got it.

222
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,199
The following.

223
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:40,239
Now on 276 of basic problems.

224
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,279
It's the best account, partly because I'm afraid the translator sort of cheats.

225
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:56,159
It makes it even better, of what understanding means to Heidegger than anybody else has got, and it's certainly important to get it right.

226
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,320
It's all the problem is, and you'll see Heidegger struggling with this, the Germans don't have any word for skill.

227
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:06,320
And oddly enough, parenthetically, neither do the French.

228
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,519
And the same awfulness occurs in Merillau-Ponty.

229
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,720
We're so lucky.

230
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:18,959
We've got skill, and we've got the phrase know-how, which Dewey introduced into philosophy and pragmatism.

231
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:25,040
And it's, listen to Heidegger's struggle with this on 276, about 12 lines from the bottom.

232
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,280
Most of you aren't going to be carrying around basic problems too.

233
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,999
But in German, we say that someone can forstein something.

234
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
Well, fürsteen is understand.

235
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,600
And forsteen means, now he goes on, literally stand in front of it or ahead of it.

236
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,600
That is, administer it, manage it, provido, preside over it.

237
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,560
This is equivalent to saying that he fürstetzich der Hauf.

238
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,159
He has an understanding of it.

239
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:06,919
Understands it in the sense, and now the translator puts it in, in the sense of being skilled or expert at it, has the know-how of it.

240
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:10,040
I mean, but it's so nice that that's exactly right.

241
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:22,840
That it's something like understanding, I don't know what, understanding, I'm trying to think something just ordinary.

242
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
He understands cars.

243
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:30,759
I mean, when he understands cars, that's not an intellectual thing, although he probably knows sort of how they work.

244
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,320
But it's this business of knowing how to manage it.

245
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:35,320
Let's go through this again.

246
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:43,479
Being skilled at dealing with them, having the know-how of how to handle them, and so forth.

247
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,359
So I'm going to go on.

248
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:50,519
The meaning of the term understanding is intended to go back to this usage in ordinary language.

249
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,560
Poor Heidegger.

250
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,679
So he hasn't got, you know, know-how or skill.

251
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:11,320
The best he's got is this phrase that somebody understands it, in that peculiar way that you could understand cars or understand, I don't know, France or something like that, where it means you can skillfully cope with it.

252
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:21,320
And he says, this understanding is the condition of the possibility of all kinds of comportment, not only practical but cognitive.

253
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:29,560
He's using know-how in such a fundamental way that it not only covers skillful coping, but skillful thinking.

254
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,959
That's all understanding and know-how.

255
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:40,439
So he's not going to exclude intellectual understanding from his notion of understanding, but it just becomes a special case of it.

256
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:43,239
And it isn't even the best case of it.

257
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,239
The best case of understanding is picking up a hammer and hammering with it.

258
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,600
Period for him.

259
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:59,600
Now, it may be the moment when I want to go to the handout where, because I find myself saying something that's good that I thought was so good that I put it on the handout.

260
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,480
Let's see.

261
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:03,679
Yes.

262
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,080
So, but I just want to say, so our skills turn out to be pre-reflective, pre-conceptual.

263
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:16,320
That's what I try to talk about when I talk about absorbed coping.

264
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:30,080
Now, to give, and that's so important because that is the rock-bottom phenomenon that Heidegger sees that nobody in the tradition ever thought about.

265
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:35,359
And Treston is, hmm, I can always get it back from somebody.

266
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,280
I need one, I need a copy of the handout.

267
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,439
I trust we didn't give them all out.

268
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,240
Thanks.

269
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,320
Did we give them all out?

270
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:46,959
Anyone not got the handout?

271
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,240
You didn't get one.

272
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,679
I made 160.

273
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,639
This room isn't supposed to.

274
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,080
You got some more up there?

275
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,879
Ah, good.

276
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:54,000
Adam has some.

277
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:09,039
Okay, I'm going to read what I, by the way, on the handout, I put on one side this complicated chart, which is going to show it's got everything in it that you could possibly want to know about the ready-to-hand, the unready-to-hand, the present-to-hand, but I don't want to talk about that right now.

278
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:23,679
On the back, it's got for the formal indication fans, if there are any, some quotes argue of showing, I think, that what Heidegger means by formal indication is like what similar, what Kripke means by rigid designation.

279
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,039
But that's, I talked about that.

280
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,320
I'm not going to go back to that.

281
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,959
What I want to read is the thing at the bottom there, our basic way of being.

282
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:44,439
Because it is, even the Heidegger readers don't understand this, even my own students don't understand this, that it's more basic than even seeing something as something.

283
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:54,919
That is, it's that already is a kind of too much of an activity of some kind of cognitive activity.

284
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,800
And here's, and what he says here is just wonderful.

285
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:11,399
What is first of all given, that is, meaning where the way we are just at our most basic way of dealing with things is the forewriting, for going in and out, for illuminating, for sitting.

286
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:15,800
See, that isn't even seeing the door as a door.

287
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:30,199
It's just being drawn by the door to go out when you need to go out, and being drawn by the windows to open them when it's hot in the room, and being drawn by chairs, particularly if you're tired, to sit on them.

288
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:48,440
It's just, there's just a direct connection between Dasein way of dealing or coping and things that solicit you to talk Gestaltist talk to take advantage of their affordances to talk Gibson talk.

289
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:52,199
I mean, there are a few people in the world who thought this way.

290
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:58,999
The Gestalt psychologists are one, and the ecological psychologist James Gibson is another.

291
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,639
But the best thing is just to stick with Heidegger, I think.

292
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:02,759
So here we go again.

293
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
What's given is the forewriting and so forth.

294
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:10,999
That is, writing, going in and out, sitting and the like are what we are a priori involved with.

295
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,879
That is, before, when he says a priori, it doesn't mean some fancy Kantian thing of universal and necessary.

296
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:32,320
It just means at the most basic level, sort of prior to anything else, but not temporally prior, but just that everything else we do presupposes we can already do this.

297
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,840
So, and what is it?

298
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,039
And what we know, it's what we know when we know our way around.

299
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:46,479
And when we learn the four watts, the four watts are the blackboards for writing on and so forth.

300
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,879
But it's even more basic than that because it's just the to write on.

301
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,800
You don't even have to put the blackboard in.

302
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:59,760
That's what my students are always putting doors in and then saying, and you see the door as the way out, and you see the blackboard as the thing to write on.

303
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,280
You can do that, particularly if something is going wrong with your, and you want to get out and the door is stuck.

304
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:15,119
But basically, the world is just there drawing you to do whatever at any given time you need to do it.

305
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,400
And that's what you know when you know your way around in the world.

306
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:24,800
That's what every kid has to gradually learn: that the floor is to walk on and so forth.

307
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,920
You want to say something?

308
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,359
It looks like, did you have a hand up?

309
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:27,919
No.

310
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:28,480
Okay.

311
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:35,519
So, and finding your way around in the world, just a second, is a sort of nice Heideggerian way to put it.

312
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,080
It's also a way that Wittgenstein puts it, you'll see in a minute, Wittgenstein and Heidegger converge at this deep level.

313
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:52,879
And it's the most basic kind of know-how we've got is just knowing how to cope with things, knowing how to do whatever we need to do.

314
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,239
Now I say something.

315
00:28:54,959 --> 00:29:02,199
Ah.

316
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,160
Ah, good question.

317
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:13,080
I think they don't have to be cultural objects at all, although I'll have to make some qualifications.

318
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,959
But I mean, to begin with, let's take a tree.

319
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:34,999
I mean, you could know how to climb a tree, and you could use the tree as equipment for getting away from animals, sleeping up there, or you could use it for equipment to get a coconut switcher up there, and you have a skill, and the tree would have a to climb.

320
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,919
And so it doesn't have to be cultural.

321
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:40,679
It just has to connect up with our needs and purposes.

322
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,840
Lots of them are only in our culture.

323
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,879
I mean, their hammering is certainly not cross-cultural, but equipment is.

324
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:57,080
Every culture has equipment, and therefore it has readiness to hand, and therefore it shows up as the to-do this or that.

325
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,119
Good question, yeah.

326
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,600
So it may be that it has to be something you tr you teach the young, or the young have to figure it out.

327
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:26,679
I'm not to think about that.

328
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:35,399
Suppose it's just a reflex sort of thing that birds learn how to fly.

329
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,600
They just get out of the nest and they do it.

330
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,240
So, but i is that a s some coping of this sort?

331
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:46,119
Is that the way of getting around in the world?

332
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,639
Uh hmm.

333
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,959
Do birds have a know-how when they know how to fly?

334
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:53,919
I don't know.

335
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:58,960
It I don't think it's going to make a big deal difference, but if it does, let me know.

336
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:06,800
I mean, maybe there's something that's importantly incl that we include the birds and animals as having know-how.

337
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:18,480
And maybe it, I mean, they certainly can know how to climb a tree, animals, and it seems to me, yeah, but they don't have to understand it as the being of it is the being of equipment.

338
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:32,720
They don't need to have in their practices an understanding of it in its equipmentality as opposed to its being a substance and having a different way of treating it or being a Daseine and have a different way of treating it.

339
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:44,799
I think that it needn't be cultural, but it better be something that people understand.

340
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,440
I mean, when it isn't cultural, I want to think a minute.

341
00:31:54,239 --> 00:32:05,039
There's lots of know-how of this very interesting sort that isn't a question of coping, but it's a skillful dealing with things.

342
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,439
Oh, let me just say that, and then I'll let Dave say something.

343
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,799
I mean, people have a know-how of standing the right distance from each other, which varies from culture to culture and from how important the other person is.

344
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:24,400
And it's not something they believe or have rules for or think about, but it's not in the finding your way around in the world business either.

345
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:38,200
It's a kind of background practice, all right, but it's not a way of dealing with things as substances, equipment, or people.

346
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,040
Well, I bet there are paper topics in here.

347
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,520
Every time one tries to think about these things, they get harder and they're funny examples.

348
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:55,320
And you never know with a weird example, whether it's sort of some interesting anomaly, which if you focus on it and work at it, you'll learn something important, or whether it's just a marginal case and you don't have to care.

349
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:04,840
But one rule is sure: that start with the paradigm cases, the obvious, easy ones, like hammering to find out what equipment is.

350
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:10,600
And then start asking hard questions, like, if it's in a drawer, is it still a hammer?

351
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,919
Or is it only should have got a being of readiness to hand when you're actually hammering?

352
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,680
We talked about that already, I believe.

353
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,719
Okay, but now I want to see what Dave has to say about this.

354
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:19,959
Yeah.

355
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:27,480
The woods are particularly leisure, it's a place of resources, there's a place to avoid.

356
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,960
No, but there's already a kind of know-how, but I'll do that.

357
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,839
Okay, yes, you, that's right.

358
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,200
Knowing how to get around in the world is knowing what, when you should go to the woods and when you should stay out of the woods and what you should do in the woods.

359
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:48,360
All that know-how is, I suppose, treating the woods as a ready-to-hand, cultural something or other.

360
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,079
Yes.

361
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,399
Okay, I want to go on.

362
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,999
I think, I mean, if there is some difficult, interesting difficulty lurking in there, come and talk to me at office hours about it.

363
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,919
Or maybe we'll just fall on it.

364
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,679
Right now, I don't see it.

365
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:03,399
But let's go on.

366
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,959
Maybe it'll come out even if we go on reading this great passage.

367
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:16,520
Because I consider this passage, which is in this obscure Heidegger book that's only just been translated and hasn't even been published in English yet, the simplest, clearest statement.

368
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,600
So we've heard about the two go in and out.

369
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,159
Then he gives an example.

370
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:33,040
A blackboard is unintelligible as such, absolutely not present, hidden and useless, almost hidden unless understood for writing on.

371
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:43,520
That is, it wouldn't be a blackboard until people had skills for writing and until it showed up for people as the to write on.

372
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:53,680
Otherwise, there could be some black thing or green thing that you might bump into or use to stop the wind or something.

373
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,320
It might be something else, but it wouldn't be a blackboard.

374
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:59,119
The same as for a door, it's for going in and out.

375
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:07,600
These things are intelligible because we are with that within which we, because we are that within which we operate.

376
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,520
Ah yeah, that gets really interesting.

377
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,239
And that's why this passage is so fascinating.

378
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:27,279
He wants to say when we're really so absorbed that we're just getting around and responding to the affordances, that is, that to do this or that, that we're not distinguishable from the world of equipment.

379
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:31,359
We are completely bored into the equipment, absorbed in the equipment.

380
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,879
That's what he wants to talk about now.

381
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:43,999
He says, we are that within which we operate, and in such a taken-for-granted way that we forget the state of affairs and its basic structure as the constitution of things.

382
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:51,760
That is, when we're just absorbed in dealing with things and finding our way around in the world, there is no distinction between us and them.

383
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:53,999
They become, they withdraw.

384
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,399
I think I said that last time, didn't I, about hammers?

385
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,559
That when we're hammering well, the hammer withdraws, and all we can, the the the nail just is going in.

386
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,800
Okay, let's go on one more paragraph.

387
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:07,639
This as what.

388
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:09,879
Now, that's where people get confused.

389
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:17,960
There is something that the blackboard is to use something as a blackboard.

390
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,159
And a blackboard is the thing that you use as a blackboard.

391
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:28,520
But it's not in your experience that you have to have it as a blackboard that is being used.

392
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:48,360
So this as what, but now he's talking about it sort of from outside, not how you're experiencing it when you're absorbed, in the light of which I understand, and which I already have, although unthematically from the outset, is nonetheless not grasped thematically in this having from the outset.

393
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,560
Well, that is really mysterious, and I can't, you've got it on your page.

394
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,720
That's why I had it printed so you could see it.

395
00:36:53,719 --> 00:37:02,280
I mean, the fact that it's a to write on is something you already understand.

396
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:10,440
And though you don't have to think about it as a blackboard, that is think thematically about it, you've got a skill for it.

397
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,199
And maybe you should think of it this way.

398
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:36,359
When you need to write on the blackboard, it'll have its to write on, just like if it's hot and you need to open the windows, which we can't do any further, then the windows, the to open, and when you need to go out of the room at the end of the class, then those two do's will show up, but you don't have to think about them or you just do them when the time comes.

399
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,719
There's somebody who wants to say something.

400
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,360
Yeah.

401
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,959
Ah, good.

402
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,840
That's right.

403
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,960
It could be an obstacle, and he talks about that.

404
00:37:55,279 --> 00:38:01,840
One way it could be an obstacle is you just surmount it and you have enough know-how, it doesn't get to be a problem.

405
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,560
I'll talk next time about the unready to hand.

406
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,400
If the door is stuck, for instance, and you can't get it open, then it becomes a special kind of obstacle.

407
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,440
And as you can imagine, you have to stop to think about it.

408
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:22,880
It's no longer a to go out, which you can just respond by being totally absorbed in its to-go-out and therefore finding yourself out.

409
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,920
And so there is a whole thing that happens when the equipment doesn't work transparently.

410
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,560
Yeah.

411
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,639
Ah, ah, well, you hear the question?

412
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,439
Probably not.

413
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,720
An amputee who can no longer write on the blackboard.

414
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:51,440
Wow, that's a problem for Marilla-Ponty.

415
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:51,999
Exactly.

416
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,200
He talks about that.

417
00:38:53,199 --> 00:39:04,320
What would happen is that what does happen with phantom limbs like that, that for a while he will still have a phantom arm and he will, Marilla Ponty does it more dramatically.

418
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,600
A phantom limb, which is what Aristotle, what Descartes talked about.

419
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:16,880
If somebody's leg is amputated, they still have a phantom leg for a while and they still get up and try to walk and fall over, or at least that's a frequent case.

420
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,399
Just like this person will go up to the blackboard with they've got no arm in hand and then discover they can't pick up the chalk and write on the blackboard.

421
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:37,719
But as they get used to finding their way around in the world as an amputee, they'll have to change their skills in which the blackboard will no longer look to them as the to write on.

422
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,159
The remember isn't that it's a a blackboard which then looks to them as something something to write on.

423
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:51,560
There just won't be a to write on at that time when you need one anymore.

424
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,680
Yeah.

425
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:04,119
Maybe it's a little absorption when you even something contrary to my being is right contrary to what?

426
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,800
Brainer.

427
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,319
Wait, wait, talk louder.

428
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:12,359
I can't hear you.

429
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:28,920
And in doing so, being invisible, even if something contrary to my being standard property.

430
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:30,840
Yes.

431
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:34,200
For one thing, we don't normally make it visible.

432
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:45,719
If Heidegger is running against the attempt to attempt to make it visible, he's doing ontology and he's doing what he calls hermeneutics, which is a kind of interpretation.

433
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:53,240
And he's doing phenomenology, which is really what we're doing now, trying to describe our most basic way of being in the world.

434
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:56,919
It's not our normal behavior, and nobody should be doing it normally.

435
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:01,799
If you do, you're going to have trouble getting around in the world trying to if you okay.

436
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:13,479
And and I'm going to turn right to what you raised, which is what ha the the the job that Heidegger's taking on of taking what is, you you d you're exactly on the right track.

437
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:26,479
Heidegger has described something which is somehow going to be very hard to do, namely to describe and talk about, which in its very essence is something which we shouldn't normally be able to describe and talk about.

438
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,439
That's what you're saying.

439
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:27,999
Very good.

440
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,280
Yeah, you're right on it.

441
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:29,679
Yeah.

442
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,639
Yeah, he wants to write.

443
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:06,080
He needs to raise the question of what it is to be a Dasein because that's Dasein's job.

444
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:14,400
And that's that right now, I mean, it's not playing much of a role in the discussion of finding your way around in the world.

445
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,680
I can connect it.

446
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:27,040
Remember that it happens to be a feature, not happens, it is the essential feature of Dasein to take a stand on its own being.

447
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:36,719
And the only way it can do that is by using equipment, and now in this new language, responding to the affordances and getting around in the world.

448
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,479
That's what you do if you're the bad child in the family.

449
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:50,479
You do it in the way that kind of being, that way, or a sacrificial mother or a teacher, the same examples I used last time, not to complicate things with new ones.

450
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
I mean, you do all that.

451
00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:04,199
Yet all this transparent coping is in the service of, one, finding your way around in the world, which, two, is in the service finally of taking a stand on your being.

452
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:11,399
I mean, you end up, we'll talk about that a lot more next time, being a teacher or being a student and so forth.

453
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:19,720
That's, and then you, the, the blackboards will show up as the to write on, and the books will show up as to read.

454
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:21,239
I don't know if I can say more about it.

455
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:23,320
Is that all right, or have I missed the point?

456
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:29,799
I don't think you're standing on being a word basis, of course, on background.

457
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:34,199
In fact, the background is much more fun.

458
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:40,759
Then all of the same is reading coping.

459
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:45,880
All these very substantial inbrex coping is one of all the things.

460
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,560
Well, I think I'm with Heidegger.

461
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:59,720
That's his word for it is umgang or dealing and or understanding.

462
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:06,520
And you'll see, I just jump way ahead and just sort of for the time being, put this as a problem for later.

463
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,359
He says that our understanding of being, what's he?

464
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,280
Well, how do I put it just to say, how does he put it?

465
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,680
It's something like our coping.

466
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:27,960
Well, see if I can open to it, but you jumped ahead.

467
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,839
But he does have a very, it's a very important question here.

468
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:32,600
He certainly has a view about it.

469
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,359
It's been a very, very complicated part of the text.

470
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,159
So I'm not sure I can just find it.

471
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:45,080
But I'll give it a try, and then I'll tell you later.

472
00:44:48,400 --> 00:45:10,159
I think he says, and it's somewhere on page 118 and 119, I think, that our understanding, in his sense, of coping and our familiarity, which is his story about finding our way around in the world, go to make up our understanding of being.

473
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:15,440
But I can't just open to it, so we'll have to put it aside for a while.

474
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:51,359
But I do think that, at least I'm giving a reading of Heidegger, which is extremely pragmatic and could be, I mean, that is like a pragmatist and could be controversial, but I think it's so in here, all over the place, but in that quote, particularly, which I promise to get to next time, or hope to, that you'll see that for Heidegger, there's some very, very tight connection between our coping skills and intelligibility or being, that they are just sort of two sides of the same coin.

475
00:45:51,360 --> 00:46:02,639
There isn't, when everything is going well, there isn't any sort of distinction between this coping skill and things showing up as the to this and to that.

476
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:03,119
Yeah.

477
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,879
Well, that's good, but that's a big issue which I will put aside.

478
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:36,359
But, I mean, I'm sure, I mean, Tyler's question is coming from another interpretation of Heidegger, and so I have to defend my interpretation.

479
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:54,440
But I don't, I mean, I'm sure that Heidegger is an anti-cognitivist, anti-conceptualist, and he's very clear that the level, this most basic level, no mind has to play any role in it at all.

480
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:01,159
That you can acquire, I mean, pre-linguistic kids already have an understanding of being for Heidegger.

481
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:15,879
I no doubt they can pick up equipment and use it, they can stare at things and see their properties, they are already getting to be what I said last time, Japanese children or American, that is, they're already taking a stand on their being, and they do it all without concepts.

482
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:23,800
I mean, that's important because Heidegger's got a whole philosophical tradition of too much mental stuff.

483
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,639
What I have taken to calling lately the myth of the mental.

484
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:36,280
The myth of the mental has been around since the beginning of philosophy, that the mind has to come in and do something to make us able to find our way around in the world.

485
00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:37,960
But Heidegger doesn't think so, I think.

486
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,919
But keep your eye open.

487
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:50,279
And if you find any place where you think that Heidegger thinks the concepts or minds play any role in his fundamental level of phenomenology, what is first of all given, I will be shocked.

488
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:52,679
I would have to throw out my whole commentary.

489
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:53,240
Yeah.

490
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:09,960
Even if you, the amputee, okay, let's see.

491
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:15,560
Yes, but not at that, not as this level of first of all given.

492
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,639
I mean, it won't be looking to you directly, soliciting you to write on it.

493
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:30,720
It won't be for you that at an appropriate moment in your finding a way around in the world, the blackboard will just show up and you'll do something with it.

494
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:37,520
You can get intellectual about it, and you can say, ah, I see this person used to be able to write on the blackboard, but he can't anymore.

495
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:39,679
I used to be able to write on the blackboard and I can't anymore.

496
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:51,920
I'm trying to get you, but you're all rightly resisting, to think of this at this most, most basic level, because I think that's Heidegger's big, brilliant project.

497
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,479
But your question brings out the important facts, and his does too, in a way.

498
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:05,359
That doesn't mean that you can't thematize it, the blackboard, and see it as something to write on.

499
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,119
You certainly can.

500
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:17,919
And you can reflect, and you might even be able to some extent to make up some rules to follow, tell you that you better use the chalk and so forth to do it.

501
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,480
Yeah.

502
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,239
I think of it as something to think about.

503
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,159
I hate myself to be able to see it, which is second in foundation.

504
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:33,440
Okay.

505
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:33,999
Well.

506
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,759
That's good.

507
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:38,399
That's good.

508
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,600
Can you hear her?

509
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,320
Yeah, if you see that a newspaper in a foreign language still looks to be read.

510
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,680
I think that's right.

511
00:49:45,679 --> 00:50:02,319
I think that's just good phenomenology, which means that it's complicated, that you have a skill for reading and making sense of things, and somehow part of that skill is already activated.

512
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:08,119
It's to be read and to be made sense of, but somehow you lack a part of that skill because you can't tell how to do it.

513
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:26,760
But I don't think that's a big problem for Heidegger, because I don't think he didn't say that in order, he doesn't have to say that in order for all these affordances, these two do this and two do that, which by the way, obviously form a whole and give us our way of getting around in the world.

514
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:35,159
He doesn't have to say that all of that is sort of all the time at this very basic level.

515
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,360
He just wants to say it can be, and that's okay.

516
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:45,879
Yeah, I want to get further, but I also think that you're all right to stick at this point.

517
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,359
It still breaks down.

518
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:57,880
That's right, it can break down.

519
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,920
It's to read and then you discover.

520
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,119
That's good.

521
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:08,439
I like that.

522
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,800
I think that's it's a kind of thing like the hammer showing up as too heavy.

523
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:18,520
That is a variation on that.

524
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,960
I mean, it looks like it's to read, and then it turns out it's too foreign.

525
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,279
And then it looks like a bunch of squiggles.

526
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,720
But it's a funny, interesting case.

527
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:39,559
That's right.

528
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,119
That's right.

529
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,799
There is there's this being drawn.

530
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,319
Yeah, you are getting ahead of the story.

531
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:48,199
When we get to you, what you're describing is the unready to hand.

532
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:56,639
The unready to hand isn't the present at hand, because it's something you're trying to do and is called to do, but can't for some reason do.

533
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:58,800
And Heidegger's got a whole story about that.

534
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:01,040
And that's what you're all tuned into, yeah.

535
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:16,320
To understand the text by coping with it rather than thinking about it.

536
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,600
I think there's something right about that, oddly enough.

537
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:25,519
But obviously, but reading Heidegger is a kind of constant breakdown, it seems to me.

538
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,399
So, on the other hand, you're always in the unready to hand.

539
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,360
It isn't like reading a simple science fiction book or something.

540
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:58,240
So, I would say in doing this kind of phenomenology, this fundamental ontology phenomenology, you're bound to be in a state in which you are always sort of knocked out of what is your natural way of dealing with things.

541
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,799
And that's what makes it very special.

542
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:06,720
I'm going to go on because I'm back to where I was when I started being interested in what everybody was saying.

543
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:10,159
I mean, there's the this back to what she said.

544
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:11,839
I mean, this is a very hard job.

545
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,199
In a way, you're repeating it now.

546
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:25,440
Heidegger's giving himself the fundamental ontology as phenomenology is a job of describing something which, when it's happening and working at its best, there's nothing to say about it.

547
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,119
That's a problem.

548
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:27,839
She's smiling.

549
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:28,479
She's right.

550
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,839
Okay, so let me go on to see if I want to read this last paragraph.

551
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:36,440
I think I do, because it stresses again how absorbed we are.

552
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,639
Okay, let's see now.

553
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,680
Rather, I live in the understanding of writing, illuminating, going in and out, and the like.

554
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:53,639
More precisely, and this is the big claim, as existence I am in speaking, going, understanding, and act of understanding, dealing with.

555
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:54,679
That's pretty strong.

556
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:58,679
I mean, that's what I think shows this isn't a formal, empty claim.

557
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:05,800
This is a very interesting claim that at its most basic level, Dasein is just coping.

558
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:10,200
Speaking, going, understanding, finding its way around, dealing with.

559
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:17,880
Way later in the book, Heidegger has a sentence which was the first time I really ran into this way of thinking on his part.

560
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,320
He says, Dasein is the world existing with.

561
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:37,080
That's a sort of code for he, Dasein is by using the world, so to speak, to take a stand on itself and absorbed in the world and doing it, Dasein and the world can't be separated.

562
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:50,360
Heidegger's very, what Heidegger's trying to do, by the way, another way to put this is he doesn't want you to be able to separate us and world because that makes us too much like subjects and worlds too much like objects.

563
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:59,000
He thinks that when we are at our most basic, we just are being in the world with hyphens, as you'll have seen if you've been doing the reading.

564
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:06,439
And this is what we're, that's why all this talk about absorbed coping, because this is his destruction of Descartes.

565
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:19,840
It's to say that when we are at our most fundamental and in a certain sense at our best, when we're coping and finding our way around in the world, there isn't any difference between us and the world.

566
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,999
We are that much absorbed in it.

567
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:27,840
Rock climbers sometimes say there's no distinction between them and the mountain when they're totally absorbed in climbing.

568
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,400
It's as if we're all like that most of the time.

569
00:55:31,279 --> 00:55:41,200
To take Heidegger's example, when we go out of the door, we use the latch, he says, that we are not sort of noticing it, paying attention to it, or anything.

570
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,840
It's just part of the basic ongoing activity.

571
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:50,240
Ongoing activity, by the way, is a Dewey phrase which would fit Heidegger very well.

572
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:51,359
But I've got to go back.

573
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,879
You want to say something quick?

574
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,360
And I may not answer it, but we'll see.

575
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,159
I don't think I have any given hand on this.

576
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,600
Well, we can.

577
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,119
You're all getting ahead of that story.

578
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:19,520
I don't.

579
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,400
I mean, some of you are making hard problems for where we are.

580
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,040
Some of you are sensing where we're going.

581
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,439
Okay, that's all ready to hand, and that's got to do with what it is to see something as a substance.

582
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,119
Heidegger's not going to deny that we experience substances.

583
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:39,840
He's got to explain it in terms of some kind of breakdown of this total absorbed activity.

584
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:49,600
But I'm sticking, so let me just read it one: my being in the world is nothing other than the already operating with understanding in this mode of being.

585
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,959
You see why I like this passage.

586
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:59,199
This is like a summary of the most extreme, bottom-level, a priori kind of coping being that we are.

587
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:07,320
But now I have to get back to something definitely I want to cover, namely her thing again, because there's this puzzle of how Heidi is going to ever do this.

588
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:08,680
Okay, let's see now.

589
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:09,559
Where are we?

590
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:13,639
Well, the tradition has always missed the background.

591
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:18,520
For 2,000 years, philosophers have not described the background.

592
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:21,080
The background is invisible.

593
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,119
Another way to put it is it's like the light in the room.

594
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:27,320
I mean, it's thanks to the light in the room that we can see anything.

595
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:33,560
The more we see things, we see things the better and better, the more we don't see the light in the room.

596
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,680
The way it withdraws goes to neutral and so forth.

597
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:52,759
So he's describing what we, and that's when he says that what is ontologically nearest to us, namely this coping that we are, this finding our way around in the world that we are, is ontologically farthest away.

598
00:57:52,759 --> 00:57:54,040
That's on 37.

599
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,080
I think we read it already.

600
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,760
Did we read it already?

601
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,039
Anybody remember?

602
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:07,720
Anyway, it's on page 16 in the German, and he says, this is all about this, how we're related to this being in the world.

603
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:17,560
Dasein is about five lines down, ontically closest to itself and ontologically farthest away, and pre-ontologically it's not a stranger.

604
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:23,720
That is, you've got a sense of that things are going okay when things are going okay.

605
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:31,879
And I take it that's the way you have a sign of preontological familiarity with and with what's going on.

606
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:34,040
Okay, now let's see.

607
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:35,960
I'm going to go fast over things.

608
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,319
The background is not a belief system.

609
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,600
It's much more basic than that.

610
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,319
You can have it before you even have any beliefs.

611
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:46,200
It's in your bodily dispositions.

612
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:47,800
It's pervasive.

613
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:49,679
There's no contrast class.

614
00:58:51,040 --> 00:59:05,280
There's nothing that, well, there's something different, naming the foreground, but the background is somehow everywhere, and you can't find a place where it isn't, so to speak, so you can contrast it for what it is.

615
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:11,119
Now comes the part I wanted to be sure and get to, because it really amuses or intrigues me.

616
00:59:11,759 --> 00:59:17,520
Wittgenstein also, late in his life, came across the background.

617
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:26,719
And he says, quote, this is from remarks on the philosophy of psychology: how could human behavior be described?

618
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:32,159
Surely only by showing the actions of a variety of humans as they are all mixed up together.

619
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:39,119
Not what one is doing now, but the Hurley Burley, the whole Hurley-Burley, is the background, which is in German Gevimmel.

620
00:59:39,279 --> 00:59:50,320
That's as good as the whole Hurley Burley is the background against which, that's the Vohrauf, not the Vohraufen, but it's the German there is Borau.

621
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,679
It's the background against which we see an action.

622
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,039
It determines our judgments, our concepts, and our reactions.

623
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,080
He's got onto exactly the same thing.

624
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:05,280
Only his reaction, unlike Heidegger's, is more like hers.

625
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,760
Wittgenstein says, well, if that's what it is, we can't describe it.

626
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,199
It's hopeless.

627
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:17,839
In Culture and Value, which is a collection of aphorisms.

628
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:30,720
On 16, he says, perhaps what is inexpressible and I find mysterious and am not able to express is the background against which whatever I could express has its meaning.

629
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:44,360
So Wittgenstein has come across the Vohaufen, to that on the basis of which, and he's come across it and he sees that it would be, he thinks, impossible to describe.

630
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:51,480
Heidegger thinks, and this is important, it's hard, all right, but he's going to do it.

631
01:00:51,480 --> 01:01:02,280
He's going to articulate, even though it's a hurly-burly and a mess, he's going to articulate the structure of everyday being in the world.

632
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,320
And that's amazing.

633
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:10,279
You can imagine how it must have felt to have been Heidegger.

634
01:01:10,279 --> 01:01:22,200
Because he sees something that he thinks the whole tradition has never seen, and he's going to take it on in a way that looks like it's impossible to take it on.

635
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:38,040
He's going to take it on, and even though they didn't see it because it was sort of necessarily withdrawn and invisible when it did its job, he's going to describe it and get us to see what it's like when it's doing its job.

636
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:46,600
I want to read you something else from Basic Problems, where he says that the tradition has never seen this.

637
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:48,840
Where is it?

638
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:52,600
Passed over by the whole tradition, I write.

639
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:00,680
The surrounding world is different in a certain way for each of us, and notwithstanding that, we move about in a common world.

640
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:08,920
And then he says, the concept of world or the phenomenon thus designated is what has hitherto not yet been recognized in philosophy.

641
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,919
So he thinks there is this very important background or world.

642
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:15,240
You'll see they come out to the same.

643
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:27,119
And that it hasn't ever been seen, and it's only natural because, like the light in the room, the more it works better, the more it becomes invisible.

644
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:32,480
And I want to say that sounds like an incredibly arrogant claim.

645
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,080
And it is in a way.

646
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:40,080
But certain people have a right to be incredibly arrogant because they're doing something incredibly impressive.

647
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:46,239
I mean, Dante puts himself with the great poets of history, Homer and Virgil and so forth, in the Divine Comedy.

648
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:51,600
That's a lot of puts, but and the same thing Heidegger does.

649
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:58,560
But I was going to read you another passage, but I didn't bring it with me, but it's not something we need to absolutely see right now.

650
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:17,600
But he's also the humblest person ever in philosophy because he says in Basic Problems that surely there is something wrong with what he's writing, that he can't see it, but you can be sure that there is something fundamental that he is missing and leaving out.

651
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,480
And that's what's always been the case in philosophy.

652
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:27,600
Every philosopher has always been, the next philosopher has always claimed that the previous one has got it wrong and missed something fundamental.

653
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,440
But each philosopher says, but I haven't.

654
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,559
I've got it all right.

655
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:36,319
Finally, Leibniz or Spinoza or Kant or Descartes would say that.

656
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:50,799
Well, Heidegger sees that this thing he's taking on, this job, is so hard that he's not going to be able to sort of complete it systematically and say, now I've done it, I've given you the structure of the world, but he's going to do some of it.

657
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,440
And he's going to necessarily leave some of it out.

658
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,920
And anyway, that's what happens to him.

659
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,719
He left lots of very important things out.

660
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:02,319
That's not what we're going to talk about now.

661
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:11,720
So now I still want to go on because I see I've got something here.

662
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:12,680
Yeah, okay.

663
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:16,520
I want to talk about world for the last ten minutes.

664
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,879
And then I will be where I want to be, which is pretty amazing.

665
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:21,159
Maybe.

666
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:24,919
So there's four senses of world.

667
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:40,999
If he's going to do this amazing job of taking on and describing the background, the world, the on the basis of which, that which we are totally absorbed in when everything is going at its best, he better at least tell us more about it.

668
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,240
So on 93, there are these important definitions.

669
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:47,560
Four meanings of world.

670
01:04:47,880 --> 01:05:03,320
I think it would have been better if he had called the first two, which are world are categorial, that is, they're the world as an object.

671
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:09,480
And if you're talking about the world as an object, I think it would be nice if he would call it a universe.

672
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:16,920
The universe is this object which has all these galaxies and trees and quarks and stuff in it.

673
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,520
And the world is something that people have.

674
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,799
There is a business world.

675
01:05:21,799 --> 01:05:32,439
Once you have this course, you'll never be able to say anymore sort of how many stars there are in the world, because there are no stars in the world.

676
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,839
I mean, galaxies and stuff.

677
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:36,440
They're in the universe.

678
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:47,199
And the world is always a holistic bunch of human practices related to human goals and so forth.

679
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:50,400
I can't resist, though, time is running out.

680
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:58,159
Some of you know that Terence Malik, the movie director who made the Thin Red Line and so forth, is a Heideggerian.

681
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,399
He translated a book by Heidegger.

682
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:07,600
He went with a Rhodes Scholarship to write his thesis on worlds, world, in fact, in Heidegger.

683
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:15,600
And so, in his latest movie, which bombed so completely that I think none of you saw it, anybody get to see The New World before it folded?

684
01:06:15,759 --> 01:06:19,440
In The New World, there's a, you don't get to see it.

685
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:30,159
I was on the set, and there was a point where Heidegger has, what's his name, Christian Bale, who is John Rolf, asking Pocahontas, she's asking him questions.

686
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:35,600
And one of the questions she asks him is: what's the difference between the Earth and the world?

687
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:48,480
And Bale, who is quite smart, obviously, looked a bit stunned, and then he said, Well, worlds have people in it, but the Earth doesn't, or needn't.

688
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,919
I think doesn't, he said.

689
01:06:49,919 --> 01:07:02,959
And unfortunately, I didn't get into the movie, but at least not in the version that the two of you saw, but there's a three-hour D, at least there's a three-hour DVD that's going to come out of the New World.

690
01:07:02,959 --> 01:07:06,239
And it's hopefully going to have this line in it.

691
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:14,319
But anyway, keep your eye on Malik, because all of his movies are about worlds, about what it is to be a world, and things that happen with worlds.

692
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,199
Okay, I said that.

693
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:26,560
Now you can go see Badlands and see if you can figure out how it happens there and how it happens in Days of Heaven, how it happens in Thin Red Line, how all of them are certain about some aspect of the world.

694
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:39,719
He went to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and he said to Ryle, I want to write my thesis on world in Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and maybe Nietzsche, I don't remember.

695
01:07:39,879 --> 01:07:42,039
And Ryle said to him, You can't do that.

696
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:44,199
You've got to write a philosophical thesis.

697
01:07:44,919 --> 01:07:51,639
So he quit philosophy on the spot, and now we have movies about worlds, and nobody says he can't do that.

698
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:54,919
Okay, so here we got back to worlds now.

699
01:07:54,919 --> 01:08:06,839
The top two worlds on 93 is the first one, world is used as an ontical concept and signifies the totality of those entities that can be present at hand within the world.

700
01:08:06,839 --> 01:08:17,879
It helps a lot if you just say that it's the universe and all of those entities that are present at hand in the universe, from quarks to galaxies.

701
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:24,839
Then the second meaning of world, and by the way, that's categorical, obviously, because it's about substances.

702
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:34,759
And the second meaning is also categorial, and it's the way of being of, here Heidegger says world, I want to say universe.

703
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:40,119
World functions as an ontological term and signifies the being of those entities we just mentioned.

704
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:45,719
That would be the being of all those substances from stars to electrons.

705
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:51,079
And indeed, world can become a term for any realm which encompasses a multiplicity of entities.

706
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:56,280
That's the business world, the theater world, the academic.

707
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,719
Oh, well, no, sorry, that's exactly wrong.

708
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:04,279
No, it has to be entities that don't relate to us.

709
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:09,239
So any bunch, I mean, I the universe or what?

710
01:09:10,999 --> 01:09:15,159
Well, some mathematical bunch of sets would have this character.

711
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:24,799
It's the way anything that can be any realm, well, I'm getting very confused.

712
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:30,719
Any realm which I come to the Marquis, for instance, one can talk of the world of the mathematician.

713
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:37,039
World signifies, aha, yes, a realm of possible objects, namely, say, the real numbers.

714
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,799
And it's a kind of universe of discourse.

715
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:50,719
We do use universe, not only for galaxies, but for any talk about any domain of entities.

716
01:09:50,719 --> 01:10:03,199
But the important thing he wants to do is to get that sense of world out of the way, categorical and call it universe, for what his sense of the world, and that's what we have to do just up to the end.

717
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:23,119
Or now, and now we're in Heidegger and Terry Malik territory, world can be understood in another ontical sense, not however as those entities which Dasein essentially is not and which can be encountered within the world, but rather as that wherein a factical Dasein is said to live.

718
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:35,520
That is, you could see that in the academic world, the theater world, the business world, those are wherein Daseins can actually hope, find their way around in.

719
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,119
You can find your way around in the theater world or the academic world.

720
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,560
And he says, here again, there are different possibilities.

721
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,879
It could be the public we world or the most close domestic world.

722
01:10:46,879 --> 01:10:50,799
And now comes the kind, that's an existential kind of world.

723
01:10:50,799 --> 01:10:54,560
And now comes the other existential use of world, the most important one for him.

724
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,600
Finally, world designates the optico-existential concept of worldhood.

725
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,719
That's really, that's the structure of the document.

726
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:12,440
Worldhood itself may have as its modes whatever structural holes any special worlds may have at the time, but it embraces in itself the a priori character of worldhood in general.

727
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:26,520
That is, what is the general structure of any world which is something that human beings can live in, find their way around in, cope with, and understand themselves in terms of.

01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:37,719
If I were trying to test you on this, I would, if I were writing an exam, I would ask if you could deal with the following, sort of like the problem for Christian Dale, but it's related.

729
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:44,679
Suppose I said to you, what is the difference between the world of physics and the physical world?

730
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,159
Their world is being used in the universe sense.

731
01:11:52,280 --> 01:12:04,679
The world of physics is those bunch of practices that physics people engage in and are absorbed in and understand themselves in terms of.

732
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:06,919
That's the world of physics.

733
01:12:06,919 --> 01:12:26,679
And the physical world, be better to say universe there, the physical universe is that bunch of substances or entities that these people, namely the physicists, take a stand on their being by going through all these activities and observing them and making theories about.

734
01:12:26,999 --> 01:12:40,440
So now I think I said just in time all that I really felt I have to say, yeah, we're ready next time to go on to the holistic structure of the world.

735
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:55,999
Be sure and read up, read up past, I'm going to probably go maybe a little bit past 104 because up to maybe 107, because all of this, naturally, the world's talk all hangs together.

736
01:12:55,999 --> 01:12:56,560
Okay.
