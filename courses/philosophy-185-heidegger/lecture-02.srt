1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,040
Where we were last time was that we were doing the three kinds of being, the three modes of being that Heidegger talks about.

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:31,200
I would say that he thinks they're the only ones there are, because he certainly writes 99% of the book as if he thought they were the ahistorical cross-cultural modes of being.

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:41,280
Namely, there's equipment in any culture, you would think, and objects or substances that people can stare at and note the properties of.

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,759
And there are human beings whose way of being is always existence.

5
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:58,159
And yet, there's a page somewhere, I won't even bother to look it up, where he just amazingly says, well, and maybe these ways of talking don't fit the primitives.

6
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:12,319
That is some culture, I presume, who has totems and who thinks that equipment is sacred things and that you use them not to cut down the wheat, but you use them because the gods told you to or something.

7
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:29,120
Anyway, I wouldn't think, I wouldn't even mention it, except that it shows that he's not trying to do some traditional philosophical Kantian move to tell you that about some necessary universal conditions.

8
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:45,760
What he's doing is telling you that in all the forms of Dasein he's ever experienced or read about and so forth, these three ways of being exhaust the ways of being that Dasein encounters.

9
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,439
And so let's go on like that.

10
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,679
I mean, I think there's nothing more to say about the strange possibility that there are exceptions.

11
00:01:52,679 --> 00:02:04,760
The third way, well, because we've done now equipment and its way of being through Handenheit, readiness to hand, and we've done objects, substances.

12
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:13,640
Better to call them substances than objects, since Descartes invents the notion of objects, and for him, objects are always objects for subjects.

13
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:23,399
Remember, Heidegger's just going back to Aristotle's normal understanding of every sort of entity, namely that it's a substance, period.

14
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:32,839
A lot of them would be around whether they were any people around or not, where subjects, subjects only seem to, objects seem to correlate with subjects.

15
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,599
So we'll talk about substances.

16
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:46,679
The way of being of substances is, of course, we talked about that, that they are self-sufficient and have properties that are, with certain qualifications, also self-sufficient.

17
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,519
And we got up to Dasein.

18
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,119
And Dasein, remember, is us.

19
00:02:52,119 --> 00:03:04,040
And, or when Heidegger sometimes says later, and it sort of helps sometimes to say it this way, Dasein, he talks about the Dasein in us.

20
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:14,359
That is, it's whatever it is about human beings that makes them make their being an issue for them.

21
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:18,439
And that's the Dasein in us.

22
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:27,480
And if it turns out that dolphins are worrying about their understanding of being or making it an issue for them, then Dasein, then dolphins would have Dasein in them.

23
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:41,439
Heidegger doesn't think that there's any, doesn't have any reason to believe that there's anything but people who have an interpretation of what it is to be a person built into their practices.

24
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:48,559
So again, just for straight approximation, we're just going to call us Daseine.

25
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Well, yeah, we are Dasein.

26
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,959
What is our way of being?

27
00:03:53,279 --> 00:04:01,920
That is, our way of being is to make our being an issue for us, and that's what's called existence.

28
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,880
Remember, that's how far we've gotten last time.

29
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,719
And yeah, problem worry?

30
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,880
Ah, well, interestingly enough, in Being in Time, they just don't come into the questions.

31
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,479
They're substances, obviously, because they aren't equipment, or they can be, but they're always substances.

32
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:32,480
But later, Heidegger, a little later, five years after being in time, wrote a big fat book, half of which is about boredom and half of which is about animals.

33
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,079
There's no big connection there.

34
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,079
That's just how it turned out.

35
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,959
And there, but it's not very interesting, what Heidegger says about animals.

36
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,440
It's derivative from what the ethnologists were saying.

37
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,839
He says animals are not things.

38
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,519
They have an environment.

39
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,279
But that's not a world.

40
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,599
Animals, but they have something like a world.

41
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,880
And anyway, if you're interested in animals, you come to office hours and I can tell you where to read about it.

42
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,999
But you won't, I'm afraid, learn deep things about animals from Heidegger.

43
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,479
So that's a sensible question.

44
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:17,120
Now, so let's go to Dasein's being being an issue for it.

45
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,360
I talked about that last time already, so I don't want to spend a lot of time going over it.

46
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:32,840
Um this is we're on page 32 of being in time where all this happens in a condensed way so that my copy is all scribbled up and yours should be too.

47
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:46,839
So and you find him saying on page 32 the second paragraph, oh by the way, I have to tell you, I'm always going to be giving a second page number because how many are reading it in German?

48
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,079
I know at least one person is reading it in German.

49
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,560
Hi.

50
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,680
I hope there are more.

51
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,480
Good, too.

52
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,279
Many more?

53
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,519
And I'm glad if people are reading it in German.

54
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,720
Did you see another hand?

55
00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:10,760
And bringing good and bringing the German to class because it might always be the case that though I have read it sort of in German, I mean on and off, I may have just overlooked some mistranslation or some better way of saying what's going on.

56
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:20,519
And if you find when you read the German that it's illuminating and we should be paying attention to it, you can either raise your hand and tell me or come in after to office hours.

57
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:31,399
Office hours turned into a nice sort of discussion section for the first week in which there were about, I don't know, six or seven people coming with various questions.

58
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:40,279
In office hours, if you want to talk about Heidegger, which is mostly what anybody coming to my office hours would want to do, I'm not an advisor right now.

59
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,840
Anyway, I'm already talking to somebody about Heidegger or two or three people.

60
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,359
Don't be shy.

61
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,320
Come on in.

62
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:55,479
I mean, it seems a a waste of everybody's intellectual energy to go take up the interesting questions that arise from the lecture one by one.

63
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,519
You person each each one individual.

64
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:04,760
If you've got some individual problem or question or something, I can always certainly throw out everybody for a while.

65
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,680
But in general, treat my office hours as a supplementary discussion section.

66
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:12,959
And now, I was saying about the numbers on the sides of the page.

67
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,520
Those, of course, are the German edition numbers.

68
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,159
So on page 32, there's a 12 there.

69
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:23,279
I'm going to, and I want to read this passage right below where the 12 is.

70
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:32,479
So I'm going to always try to give the German number, partly because I want to be sure the people who are reading the German are on that, on the page.

71
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,960
But secondly, because it'll help you find out where we are.

72
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:41,680
See, if I say 32, and then I say 12, right below 12, then you know where we are.

73
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,680
So Dasein is an entity which does not just occur among entities.

74
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:53,440
Rather, it is ontically distinguished by the fact that its very being, that being, is an issue for it.

75
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:04,560
And I said, I believe I already said this, that Dasein, I put it, Dasein takes a stand on its being or has an interpretation of what it is to be a human being.

76
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,599
That's fine, except it's misleading.

77
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:17,040
But in the same way that an issue for it is misleading, it makes you think that Dasein has to actually be, so to speak, worrying about, wow, what is it to be a human being?

78
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,880
I guess maybe it's like this or like that.

79
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,800
I mean, Dasein can do that.

80
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:38,399
But Heidegger thinks that the German peasants, whom he likes a lot, and when he was invited to become a professor in Berlin, he said, no, he has to stay in Freiburg, which is some little town in the sort of boonies of Germany, because that way he gets to talk to the peasants.

81
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,000
And it's important that Heidegger, that's one of the reasons I think Heidegger manages to be so original.

82
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:56,039
I mean, he knows all the stuff that philosophers know, but he knows lots of stuff about skiing and planting crops and drinking the local wine and generally experiencing things the way the peasants do.

83
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:04,120
He writes about it in one place where he talks about what Van Gogh's painting of the peasant shoes show us about the life of them.

84
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,240
But all I want to say right now is they can be what Heidegger would call authentic.

85
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:24,120
That is, they can be taking a stand on their being and doing a very, so to speak, good job of it, meaning that what they're doing reflects what it is to be a human being without having any thinking about it.

86
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,240
So it's saying it's an issue for them or saying that they take a stand on it is somewhat misleading.

87
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,840
I gave you this example.

88
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,799
Last time I said, how about a sacrificial mother?

89
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,160
These examples are good from family therapy.

90
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:47,240
Some kid can be, from a family therapist's point of view, understanding him or herself as the bad child in the family.

91
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,760
But that doesn't mean that they have to say anything or think anything.

92
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,200
It just means they have to behave in certain family situations so as to take the heat.

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But maybe the best way to deal with this, since you're going to have to keep saying this to yourself for the whole semester since you're going to be worrying about what Dasein is, is Kierkegaard's way of putting it.

94
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,920
Heidegger's getting this from Kierkegaard.

95
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,920
Heidegger gets lots from Kierkegaard.

96
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:19,560
But Kierkegaard defines the self and says the self is a relation that relates itself to itself.

97
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,240
Well, that is the most abstract way that you could say it.

98
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:38,080
It's not, you don't say it's an issue, you don't say it's a stand, but you say that somehow in being a self or a Dasein, you are relating to what it is to be a self or a Dasein.

99
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,519
So think that if you need to.

100
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:42,719
Okay, I'm going to go on reading this.

101
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
Let's see, is an issue for it.

102
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:53,840
But in that case, this is a constituted state of Dasein's being, and this implies that Dasein in its being has a relationship toward that being.

103
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,000
You see, he's really there, he's got the Kierkegaard.

104
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,280
Dasein is a relation which relates itself toward itself.

105
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,160
A relationship which itself is one of being.

106
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:10,960
And this means further that in some way in which Dasein understands itself in its being, that to some degree it does so explicitly.

107
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,319
Now, aha, that's interesting.

108
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:14,320
I usually don't read the quote that far.

109
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,159
Now I have something I have to explain.

110
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,600
Let's see if I can get if it helps that.

111
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,519
It is peculiar to this entity that with and through its being, that being is disclosed to it.

112
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:39,839
Well, I think what you have to say is when he does, when it understands itself explicitly, I want to read that, that it manifests in itself in its behavior, what its relation to its being is.

113
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,400
So the bad child in the family does what bad children in the family do without having to say that.

114
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,159
But it becomes, I wonder about the explicitly, time for the German.

115
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,240
That's why I'm glad that you keep there with the German.

116
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:59,039
What's getting translated that Dasein understands itself to some degree explicitly?

117
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:11,440
This book is so dense that every I mean, though I've read it so many times and lectured on it so many times, every once in at least once or twice in lecture, I come across something where I suddenly realize I don't understand what he's talking about.

118
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,320
Why is he saying explicitly?

119
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,080
And what's the German?

120
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,279
Hausdorcklich?

121
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:18,480
Hausdorcklich?

122
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,880
Oh, dear.

123
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,440
Well, that's explicitly.

124
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,080
Well, I don't know what to say.

125
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,079
I don't think that's the right thing to say, Heidegger.

126
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,279
I think he should have said that it manifests in its behavior the way it relates to its being.

127
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:40,120
I mean, I don't see that the Schwarzwald, the Black Forest peasants do anything about their understanding of being explicitly or think anything.

128
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:50,040
So you can either read it your way, in which case you're going to run into problems somewhere, I'm sure, or read it my way, because I think that what I'm saying fits with what Heidegger's trying to do.

129
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,359
And so its being is disclosed to it.

130
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:02,519
I guess what that means is it's got some sense of what it is to be a human being or to be the bad child in the family or be the sacrificial mother.

131
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:10,760
That is, it's not completely, so to speak, in the dark with respect to that, but it's also not making it explicit.

132
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,360
That's important.

133
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:33,480
It sounds like I might be making more of a fuss about it than I need to, but Heidegger's trying, and I've got to say this over and over, as I read him, and every time I read him and teach him, I get more and more amazed and impressed and convinced, to understand people behaving at the absolutely rock-bottom way they behave.

134
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,640
They can do complicated things like think about theories.

135
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,240
They can do complicated things like think about what it is to be a human being.

136
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,440
They can do less complicated things like thinking about the doorknob as they go out the door.

137
00:13:46,439 --> 00:14:05,240
But Heidegger wants to talk about what we do when we cope with things, that is deal with things in our translations talk, the most round, unreflective, unthinking, totally absorbed, totally involved level.

138
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:23,040
And that's how he's going to overthrow 2,000 years of philosophy, because he's going to get, so to speak, to something more pervasive and beneath and the condition for being able to do whatever it is any philosopher before him has ever thought about.

139
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:34,480
And it turns out, when you describe this, what I would call absorbed coping, and he called this absorbed, unfortunately, he uses the word falling.

140
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,360
You'll hear him talking and talking about Dasein falling.

141
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,080
When you do, you don't want to think of sort of religious things about the fall.

142
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:54,320
You don't even want to think of sort of secular things about, say, diversion and then turning away from trying to live a life that manifests what it is to be human.

143
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:16,079
Falling is being absorbed in, and sometimes he talks that way, so that, mama, to help you, I mean, if you there is an English use of the word falling, which is not very common, but if you say somebody, they fell to work, meaning they just dug in and got involved in whatever they were working on.

144
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,760
They weren't thinking about it, they weren't planning, they were absorbed in their work.

145
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,880
That's this rock bottom way of being that Heidegger's interested in.

146
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:34,320
And that's why I don't want him to talk about making it the the question of your being explicit, because that's not ground level.

147
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:42,720
That's not this finalist way, the basicest way that we are involved with things and with ourselves.

148
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,199
Yeah.

149
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:56,519
Well, that's good.

150
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,720
That's what I like.

151
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,199
That's why I turned explicit into manifest.

152
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,479
You've got to manifest it.

153
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,719
You can't just sort of sit around and imagine you're going out the door.

154
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,519
You've got to really do it or to take another to the other opposite extreme.

155
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,800
If my ultimate stand on my being is to be a professor, well, that's something you've got to do.

156
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:26,679
I can't sit at home and read books all the time and then say I'm a professor or only come occasionally to lecture or whatever or talk so quietly nobody can hear me.

157
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,440
And there's all sorts of things you do when you're a professor to manifest it.

158
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:43,640
But I think it was my sort of identity to be a professor long before I ever asked myself sort of what am I here for and what's my vocation and calling and so forth.

159
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,440
And I was the important thing, I was doing it, manifesting it.

160
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:51,320
And that's this more rock-bottom level.

161
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,720
I didn't have to ask myself, what equipment do you use to be a professor and how do you use it?

162
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:58,759
It's all just, I just grew up in it.

163
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,799
Another hand.

164
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,159
Did you have a hand up?

165
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,320
Uh-oh.

166
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,800
It's always bad to look ahead.

167
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,120
Let's see what happens there.

168
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,919
Oh, about being ontological and preontological.

169
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,360
I was going to get to that.

170
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,079
Whoa.

171
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,679
That's even worse, isn't it?

172
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:22,360
That's disaster.

173
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:23,960
Well, let's read it.

174
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:34,280
Let's read it because the issue is whether we are really ontological or what Heidegger calls preontological.

175
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,440
And that's just a terminological distinction, but it's very important.

176
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:45,360
Ontology is the explicit understanding of being.

177
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,519
It's an ology, like genealogy or geology or whatever.

178
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,560
It's a logos.

179
00:17:52,560 --> 00:18:05,679
It's a story of explicit theoretical, I'm not sure theoretical is quite right, an explicit story about existence in this case, would be to be ontological.

180
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:08,800
And Heidegger is doing ontology.

181
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,039
Being in time is ontology.

182
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
But most people don't do ontology.

183
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,319
And now, so he needs another word for all that we've just been talking about.

184
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:24,559
Having somehow a stand on your being, an issue, or being related to yourself, and having some sense of that and manifesting that.

185
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,039
What are you going to call that if not ontological?

186
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:37,840
Well, he just calls it pre-ontological, meaning that's the sort of stuff out of which you could form a theory of or a discipline, I guess.

187
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,479
A theory is too bad because it sounds like you to sort of stand back from it all.

188
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:50,640
And it's very important in Heidegger, it's hard to say everything at once, that you can't sort of stand back from what it is to be a human being, concerned about your own being.

189
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,559
Theory of that.

190
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:56,959
But you can have a discipline of that.

191
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:05,439
And he talks about one phrase which he later, I think, regretted and which people constantly beat him over the head with, but I think he meant it when he said it.

192
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:11,520
He says later on in the book, I couldn't turn to it, that being in time is a Wissenschaft von Sein.

193
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:25,159
It's a discipline of about being, where Wissenschaft gets usually translated because there's no other way to translate it as science of, but that's not exactly right, because history is a Wissenschaft.

194
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,199
It means a discipline.

195
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,600
So do ontology is to make it the discipline to think about being.

196
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,159
But we don't do that, except in this course.

197
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:37,319
But people don't normally do that.

198
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,159
And so, but they've got all the material, so to speak, to do it.

199
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:42,919
So they're pre-ontological.

200
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:45,959
Is that going to help with that paragraph, or am I still in trouble?

201
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,759
Let me read it now.

202
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,039
I'll read the paragraph because maybe it'll help me.

203
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,519
Here, being ontological is not tantamount to developing an ontology.

204
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,679
So if we reserve the term ontology for that theoretical inquiry, gee, I was trying to save him from that.

205
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:06,360
German readers again, I can't believe that must be Wissenschaft.

206
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:07,319
No?

207
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,600
What is it?

208
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:09,719
What?

209
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,479
The RTRetish.

210
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,880
Oh, goodness, poor Heidegger.

211
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,479
I don't know what to make of all this.

212
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,399
I mean, again, you can read theoretical so that it just means a discipline.

213
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:36,199
He certainly doesn't think it's a theory in the technical sense of theory that he develops later, where to have a theory is to deworld, is to step outside of our situation and study things from nowhere.

214
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:40,120
There's this famous line from Nagel that science is the view from nowhere.

215
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,480
Heidegger thinks that too.

216
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,840
He just doesn't say it.

217
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,560
And certainly he thinks that's a good idea.

218
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,919
He's not criticizing it.

219
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:47,720
He likes science.

220
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:50,919
I'll argue that later, because some people think he doesn't.

221
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:56,439
But, I mean, his his major when he was an undergraduate was uh physics and math.

222
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:08,559
Uh so uh so he's not against theory, and he's not against stepping outside the world and the whole human situation and contemplating, say, uh galaxies and electrons and so forth.

223
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,559
So but he certainly doesn't think you can do ontology from there.

224
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,319
You can only do ontology from within the human condition.

225
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
You're always already in it, you talk like Heidegger.

226
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,719
You are, to even more jer jargon you have to get used to later, in the hermeneutic circle.

227
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,360
That is, in the circle of interpretation.

228
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:44,239
You're already interpreted, and everything you're dealing with is already interpreted by you, even more by the culture you grew up in, and you can only do anything or think anything from inside there that has to do with human beings.

229
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:46,720
So I don't understand that.

230
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:53,439
Maybe there's, you know, when things start piling up that you don't understand, it may be that you've got the wrong paradigm.

231
00:21:53,439 --> 00:22:01,360
So I have to be open to the fact that it doesn't usually happen twice in one lecture that he says something that I think he shouldn't say.

232
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:01,999
Yeah.

233
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,760
Oh, I see.

234
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,799
Does he?

235
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,519
Let's hope.

236
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:07,919
Good.

237
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:18,080
Reserving our fourth, the theoretical inquiry devoted to the if we reserve ontology for that, then we will, then we're pre-ontological.

238
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:31,360
But the trouble is, what's ontology going to mean, except the theoretical, I mean now the fundamental ontology is not going to be theoretical.

239
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,640
Okay, let's read it that way.

240
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,040
Good.

241
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,040
David will get me out of this.

242
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,640
So you could try to do theoretical ontology.

243
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,439
Philosophers have been doing it all for 2,000 years.

244
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:51,479
That is, step outside the human condition, like Plato's person who finally climbs out of the cave and looks at the ideas head-on from nowhere.

245
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,159
You can do it.

246
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,159
I mean, at least you can claim to do it.

247
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,519
I don't think Heidegger thinks anybody really succeeds in it.

248
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:08,600
But that kind of ontology, you could call it theoretical ontology, and that's certainly not how he's using the term.

249
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,360
But then, how is he using the term?

250
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,960
What is fundamental ontology?

251
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,360
We still don't know what ontology means.

252
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,479
Okay, well, okay, that's right.

253
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:21,319
So let's do it that way.

254
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:23,239
So you don't get confused.

255
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:34,039
So if you thought ontology was what philosophers traditionally thought ontology was, then you'd have to call, you couldn't call Dasein being ontological.

256
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,319
You'd have to call Dasein being pre-ontological.

257
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:54,759
And now you have to, it's still pretty murky, because now you have to switch over and say, well, pre-ontological, but not because it could ever turn out to be a theoretical discipline, but pre-another kind of ontological, that's what David is saying, namely what I'm going to do right now, explain fundamental ontology.

258
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,480
That's what you are supposed to be doing.

259
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,159
But we have to get there.

260
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,239
It's a little while yet.

261
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,159
So existence is our way of being.

262
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,239
I'm still talking about that.

263
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:14,600
And we did, we talked about, well, no, I never read the passage that said it, so I'm going to read that right now.

264
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,759
So Dasein's essence, you'll read later, essence is existence.

265
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,800
So I can say it now.

266
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,919
Dasein's essence is to be the being that takes this, makes an issue of its being.

267
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,360
And when it does that, what is its way of being?

268
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,759
Its way of being is what Heidegger is going to call existence.

269
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,679
So there we are back at that again.

270
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:36,640
That's at the bottom of 32.

271
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,439
We're still in page 12.

272
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:48,479
That kind of being toward which Dasein can comport itself in one way or another, and always does comport itself somehow, we call existence.

273
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:56,560
That's the, again, weird way to put it, but that's the kind of being, of beings that take a stand on their own being.

274
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,999
And now we're going to call that existence.

275
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:08,159
And then when you do that, now we have to skip to go back to 67.

276
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,999
Heidegger does, strangely enough, the same thing twice.

277
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:23,919
And you may have noticed if you've done the reading, which I hope you have, that I picked out from the introductions, which I don't want to talk about to the end, the kind of things that he talks about in the beginning after the introduction.

278
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,479
Because on 67, he goes back to this story about existence, but he adds something which I want to talk about.

279
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:36,479
So we're on page 42 now of the German.

280
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,360
Well, he's got to sort out existence the way he is using it.

281
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,799
That's what I want to do here.

282
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,760
From the way it's been used in the tradition and in common language forever.

283
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,239
I mean, usually it makes sense to say God exists if you believe God exists or he doesn't.

284
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:08,079
Or trees and trees exist and numbers exist or maybe subsist, but let's say exist for this discussion.

285
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,719
Anyway, but he's using existence in this very peculiar way that only human beings exist.

286
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,159
That's what he's telling you about.

287
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,439
So if you have to say, in his use of existence, God doesn't exist, and trees don't exist, and animals don't, that's okay.

288
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,520
Stones don't, Dasein does.

289
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,640
So he's saying that in the about 10 lines down on 67.

290
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:33,880
We choose to designate the being of this entity as existence.

291
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:43,479
This term does not and cannot have the ontological, and that's traditional old-fashioned ontological signification of the traditional term existentia.

292
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:55,880
Ontologically, existentia is tantamount to a being that in the tradition, as present at hand, a kind of being which is essentially inappropriate to the entities of Dasein's character.

293
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,239
That's fine.

294
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:02,199
And then he adds this new thing at the next paragraph: the essence of Dasein lies in its existence.

295
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,640
That's a big deal.

296
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,719
Sartre sort of takes off from there.

297
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:06,840
You want to say something?

298
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,399
How do we know about that?

299
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,640
How do we know what, talk about?

300
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,200
Oh, well, we don't.

301
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:24,199
I mean, that's the same thing about animals.

302
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:28,600
I mean, maybe it's further fetched even than dolphins that maybe refrigerators have it.

303
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,959
I mean, he doesn't care.

304
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,679
I mean, it's not an epistemological question.

305
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,320
It's a question, it's an ontological question.

306
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:46,279
He's trying to define what Dasein is, and he takes it for granted that he's going to say things about it that you'll recognize that you are one.

307
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:56,600
But if it turns out that there are weird gaseous Martians or something who are also Daseins, and I don't know, maybe even refrigerators, then Heidegger doesn't care.

308
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,479
And he doesn't ask how we would know.

309
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:13,279
He's just telling you how he's going to he's going to he's telling you that he's going to use this term to explain, no, sorry, to better, to refer to a way of being.

310
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,079
And of course, he's not ready to tell you the whole story about that way of being.

311
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:34,080
The whole story of that way of being is all of division one of being in time, because if that's what existence is, then if you did a story of the structure of existence, then that would be what he calls an existential analytic back on 33.

312
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,919
Oh, no, sorry.

313
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,840
I don't go back there yet.

314
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,279
I was talking about the essence of Dasein being its existence.

315
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:50,719
And I said, that's an amazingly interesting, strong claim that Sartre makes a big deal out of.

316
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:57,759
And Heidegger claims later he regrets having said it, at least the way Heidegger misunderstood it.

317
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:20,399
But what it certainly means in Heidegger and in Sartre, I think, and I don't think there's such a big misunderstanding over that, is that Dasein has no other defining characteristics except that in its activity it expresses a certain way of taking over itself.

318
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:30,559
And what I'm trying to say is, I gotta give you some other suppose if you're a Freudian and think that people are libido-maximizing machines or something like that.

319
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,800
If it's a caricature of Freud, don't worry about it.

320
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,880
I'm uh just trying to give you examples.

321
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:43,719
If you're uh a natural law philosopher and think that the that uh to be a human being you have a certain uh natural character.

322
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:50,919
And maybe uh or if you're a kind of Kantian, you think that that our essence is to be rational.

323
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,120
If you're an Aristotelian, you think to be a rational animal.

324
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,840
I mean, there are all kinds of claims about what the essence of the human being is.

325
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:22,439
And each of them lead, and if you, another one is to be you're a creature of God, each of those you can see leads to an immensely different way of life, whether you are a rational animal or a creature of God or a libido machine or something else that the sociobiologists think we are, some kind of just mostly animals enacting whatever the genetic code for this kind of animal is.

326
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:27,959
So, but he's making this claim, none of that captures what it is to be a human being.

327
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,439
And then you want to say, well, what does?

328
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:51,399
Well, what does is that there is an interpretation of what it is to be human in the culture, and you get socialized into it, and you may, and then you do believe, or can, probably do, that you do have a nature.

329
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,360
And if you get socialized into a Christian culture, you have the nature of being a creature of gods.

330
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:08,840
And if you get socialized into a Kantian culture, if there is such a thing, you would think that you were, I mean, in the Berkeley Philosophy Department, there is, you would think that you were a rational being, and so forth.

331
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:31,479
So, but the fact is, we have all those different views of what our nature is, which leads to the conclusion that our nature, our essence, let's get back to this kind of talk, is simply to be the kind of being that through their activity gives themselves a nature.

332
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,319
The of that the best per statement of it is Pascal.

333
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:43,519
Behind all of the existentialists are is this super genius Pascal who started figuring it out in the 1600s.

334
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,719
Pascal at one point in in the Pensées says custom is our nature.

335
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:53,360
That's what I've just been saying in a long, windy way in one sentence.

336
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:03,919
That is, whatever the culture tells us we are, we get socialized into it and take that to be our nature and take our behavior to follow from that.

337
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:15,439
But once you see that, then you see that there isn't any right answer to what our nature is, just that we're capable of having lots of understandings of our nature.

338
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:17,120
And that's it.

339
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,280
That's what Heidegger thinks with that phrase.

340
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,919
Yeah.

341
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:24,479
Yes.

342
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,239
Yes, exactly.

343
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:27,679
That's exactly what it is.

344
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,159
To say that custom is our nature is to say we have no nature, which is to say what?

345
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,399
That existence is our essence.

346
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,840
I'm trying to explain that sense.

347
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,759
Oh, yeah.

348
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,320
Interesting point.

349
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,479
No, I think I used to worry about that, whether when I'm brushing my teeth, I'm manifesting my understanding of being.

350
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,159
I'm not, I've never been able to be sure whether I am or not.

351
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,840
I'll give you the equipment, so to speak, for thinking about it.

352
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,559
I was going to talk about it briefly somewhere here, and probably, so why not now?

353
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,039
I have a lot.

354
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,000
How many of you are looking at my commentary and sort of reading along?

355
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:15,600
I just, well, okay, well, not very many, which is just as well.

356
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:26,919
But every once in a while, I get things sort of so interestingly right and so interestingly wrong at the same time that I can't help pointing this out, and I will have to fix it in the next edition.

357
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:41,159
I got a whole interesting story, which when I was thinking about whether we had a nature or not and how Heidegger thinks about it, I read a sociologist's account of the difference between Japanese and American babies.

358
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:46,360
And you don't have to, this is philosophy, so you don't have to worry about whether it's true or not.

359
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:51,719
Whether they've got it right, it's a kind of thought experiment.

360
00:33:51,719 --> 00:34:16,520
But anyway, in their thinking, they say, well, Japanese mothers put their babies in the cradle and sing to them and sort of lull them and rock them and make them want to be contented, whereas American mothers put their babies down in such a way that they crawl around and they sort of talk to them in such a way as to kind of keep their attention and get them all focused.

361
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,120
And I thought that was interesting.

362
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,120
And I had a TA at that point who was married to a Japanese woman.

363
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,799
And he said, that's right.

364
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:24,839
I never thought of that.

365
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:31,800
When my wife puts the baby in the cradle, she always puts the baby back in its crib or wherever on its back.

366
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:40,599
Whereas often you find the American mother, so he claimed, put the baby on the wall, you know, walking around or crawling around.

367
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:44,120
The important point I'm trying to make of all this is two things.

368
00:34:44,120 --> 00:35:01,879
One, it's right to give this example, because I want you to realize that understanding your nature or having an understanding of your way of being doesn't require thinking about, doesn't require having any intellectual content.

369
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:03,319
We're back at the ground level again.

370
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:30,960
At the ground level of babies, the moral of the paper by the sociologist was that by the time the baby is a few weeks old, it's already either in a kind of holistic, nurturing way of life, which is supposed with a Japanese way, or it's already beginning to relate to itself in the world as a kind of isolated, energetic individual out to satisfy its desires.

371
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,480
And the conclusion of the article is: by a few weeks of age, the baby is a Japanese or American baby.

372
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:50,080
And all I want you to think is, well, it's certainly not by virtue of its beliefs that it is, or it has nothing, or it doesn't think that it is, it doesn't think anything.

373
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,479
It's got no language, and it's just a little baby.

374
00:35:52,480 --> 00:36:03,040
But it's got a certain style of practices that, let's say roughly, a nurturing style of being, and we've got a kind of aggressive style of being.

375
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,719
I've heard a proverb, I don't know if you all know this, maybe it's common, I just came across it lately.

376
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:19,519
You get to sum this up about Japanese babies, that this leads to a culture in which you could have a slogan like ours that the squeaky wheel gets the oil.

377
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,719
And what would be the Japanese equivalent of a proverb like that?

378
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,080
Do you know that?

379
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,040
The nail that sticks out gets pounded down.

380
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:32,640
So those would be very different views of being, of whatever, well, of the style.

381
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,400
I want to say being for the most general thing.

382
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:59,799
So I want to say the mistake in my commentary is this mistake I just blurted out, that I was trying to find out what Heidegger meant by being, and I was looking at the Japanese baby as an example of what Heidegger meant by being, and I don't think that's right, because being has got to cover, remember, presence of hand, readiness to hand, and Dasein.

383
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:10,120
And what I was describing is something more specific, a certain style, a certain understanding of what it is to be Dasein that's different in different cultures.

384
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:20,840
It just isn't that they, according to early Heidegger, this Heidegger, everybody but those primitives, whoever they are, has the same understanding of being.

385
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,159
It was confusing to get the Japanese off having one and us having another.

386
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:34,679
But that Heidegger isn't denying that before we even think, we've already got a certain style of existing.

387
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:35,159
Yeah.

388
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,719
Well, you're bunny.

389
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:54,199
Bottom of the question, when you were talking about the preontological, with self-interpreting danger of what it means to be human then, does happen in the preontological or unrequited way?

390
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,319
Yes, yes.

391
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,640
We're mostly preontological all the time.

392
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,319
Your question is great because that gives me a punchline I didn't know I had.

393
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:05,479
The baby already has a preontological understanding of being.

394
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:13,560
Not its understanding that nurturing versus aggressive, but the baby's already going to begin to understand the rattle.

395
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:27,640
Maybe the American baby is what you throw to get your parents to go and have to pick it up and bring it, and maybe the Japanese baby like a uh Mexican rain stick where you can rat rattle the rattle 'cause it makes nice rainy noises and helps you go to sleep.

396
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,080
I mean, they've already beginning to get an understanding of equipment.

397
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:40,239
I presume maybe they when they lie and look at the thing over their head, if they've got one of those they already are beginning to see entity objects with properties and so forth.

398
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:59,040
So that you you I think preontological is what every Dasein is as soon as it's got any kind of stand any well Yeah, as soon as it starts to relate to something or others, substances and equipment and itself.

399
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,600
When it's starting to relate to itself, that third kind, that's what I'm calling the style of its existence, it's got that too.

400
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,640
And that's part of what's preontological.

401
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
Well, no, it's got that too.

402
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,560
We don't want to I'm learning something.

403
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:24,080
I mean, I'm not right here learning it, but over the last, I don't know, year or so, I've got to keep reminding myself that ontology has only to do with the being.

404
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,679
It's the most general level.

405
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,240
I'll have to specify that more in a minute.

406
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:37,199
And so I don't, I keep wanting to not lapse into saying that the style of things is different.

407
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,360
A little footnote on that, real quick.

408
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,679
I mean, it's not that what I'm saying is really wrong about Heidegger.

409
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,679
It's wrong about early Heidegger.

410
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:57,440
The big move from early Heidegger to late Heidegger, which takes place about five years after being in time, is he decides that there are different understandings of being in various cultures.

411
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,080
And lots of cultures don't even have an understanding of being.

412
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,199
I'm sure he would say that, probably would say that of the Japanese.

413
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:10,719
To have an understanding of being is a very unique thing where all the practices have the same style.

414
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,279
Whereas in some culture, you can have a bunch of practice.

415
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,159
I'll give you the Bali example from Geertz.

416
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:25,480
I mean, the men have their style, and it's expressed in the cockfight in Bali, and the women have their style, and that's in the weaving rituals and so forth.

417
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,040
There may not be any one understanding of being.

418
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,360
And then Heidegger gets the idea that in our culture, we've got one understanding of being.

419
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:35,400
And then he gets the idea, no good grief, we've got three.

420
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:43,239
And then by the time he's done, he thinks there are seven different understandings of ethics of understanding of being in our culture.

421
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:46,679
But all that, and then it begins to look like styles, all right.

422
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:53,079
And but and I keep falling into that because I know teach and write later Heidegger too.

423
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,279
But focusing on being in time, let's just do it again.

424
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,600
There's only one understanding of being.

425
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:08,440
We haven't decided how to characterize it, but we know that it's got three aspects: readiness to hand, presence at hand, and existence.

426
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,759
Okay, I saw a hand.

427
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,159
Yeah.

428
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:19,080
Heidegger makes his own philosophy of, you know, if we didn't do this, what makes that?

429
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,640
Oh, that is a terrific truth.

430
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:27,159
Good.

431
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,839
You're a philosophy major, I bet.

432
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,040
That is a typical philosophy major question, and that is the right question.

433
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,439
And Heidegger really worries about it.

434
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,359
And I don't know where I was going to fit it in.

435
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:48,120
In fact, I finally left it out of my lecture because I thought, oh, this is so sort of a special philosophical worry that I shouldn't worry at this basic state.

436
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,839
But he does.

437
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,840
So I'm going to tell you about it right now.

438
00:41:50,839 --> 00:42:05,640
Heidegger, in the lectures in the 1920s, when he was running up to finally doing Being in Time, published in 1927, he was very concerned with something he called formal indication.

439
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:15,759
Formal indication, formale Anzeige, which is the German, and I tell you that only because the German gets translated all sorts of different ways.

440
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:22,720
These guys don't understand that it's an important concept for Heidegger, and you have to translate it the same every time.

441
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,880
And what is formal indication?

442
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:29,760
Well, it's the, so to speak, methodological response to what you say.

443
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:44,480
It's the claim that you've got to start somewhere with a claim that this is the essence of such and such, but you want to make it provisional so that further investigation can call it into question.

444
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,679
And only at the end of your investigation will you either discover you got it wrong or that you had the right to say that.

445
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:54,080
Now, let me read you places where that happens.

446
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:09,520
I'm very interested in formal indication because as far as I can see, nobody for a long time, maybe they've caught up now, understood what Heidegger meant by it except me, and I understood it because I also knew some analytic philosophy.

447
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:17,360
Heidegger was on to something that Kripke, how many come across Kripte and rigid designation?

448
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:23,360
Okay, well, Kripke is a very, very, very smart analytic logician.

449
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,800
And I'll tell you it in Kripty terms first, because then you can understand it when Heidegger does it.

450
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:49,600
Kripke says that we can designate something by some property, which could be its defining property, and we ought to treat it as its defining property provisionally and keep investigating it until we find out whether we really got its essential property.

451
00:43:49,600 --> 00:44:01,159
And I take it, I don't remember he says this, but I take essential property to mean the property that explains all of its important characteristics or something.

452
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:03,320
So he gives us an example gold.

453
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:11,080
You can start by saying, I'm going to call that yellow stuff gold, and I'm going to investigate that yellow stuff and see what its essence is.

454
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:22,360
And then you discover when you start to investigate, well, one, there's stuff that looks like that, but it clearly isn't like that, fool's gold, and you discover there's other stuff that really is gold.

455
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:27,640
For instance, it doesn't dissolve in any solvent, but it's not gold, it's white, and so forth.

456
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:37,879
But you keep investigating, and finally, atomic theory comes along, and finally you discover that gold is the essence of gold is it has an atomic number, I think it is of 72, is that right?

457
00:44:37,879 --> 00:44:39,480
Or weight, I think number.

458
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:53,239
And it turns out, if you have enough theory, that you can explain why it's yellow sometime and white sometime and why it doesn't dissolve in acids and what its malleability and conductivity and all that is, given its atomic structure.

459
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:54,919
So now you know its essence.

460
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:05,000
And you have what you tentatively designated as gold.

461
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:12,839
Now you can say, well, whatever has this property, namely atomic number 72, that, and that alone is gold.

462
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,679
Let me give you two other quick examples.

463
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:19,080
You start with a flash in the sky, and you say, we're going to call that lightning.

464
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:29,079
And then, after a much investigation and culture going along, science finally comes around and tells you it's essentially an electrical discharge, whether you see it or not.

465
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,719
I suppose lightning goes on in the daytime and we don't see it.

466
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:32,279
Is that right?

467
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:34,440
I've always wondered when I get to this point.

468
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:35,839
But let's suppose so.

469
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:36,959
And the final one is heat.

470
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,559
So heat's what feels hot to you, and heat is what makes things boil.

471
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:43,360
Finally, you designate it like that.

472
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:50,560
Finally, after a lot of investigation, you discover the essential thing about heat is that the molecules are bouncing around and bumping into things and each other.

473
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,120
So, and that's now what's Heidegger going to do?

474
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,239
And you're looking worried.

475
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,840
Have I already said, should I go on or should I?

476
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,560
I've got to hear what you're worried about.

477
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,040
Yes.

478
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:06,640
Yes.

479
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,600
Well, let's go to this.

480
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,199
You're absolutely right.

481
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:12,079
I'm glad I asked you because you're the next step.

482
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:20,719
Yeah, when Heidegger's talking about formal indication, he wants to talk about how to find the essence of Dasein.

483
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:21,759
That's what's worrying him.

484
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:23,040
That's his question.

485
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:30,159
How do I have the right to say that the essence of Dasein is its existence and not say that it's a creature of God or something?

486
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:41,360
And he does, what he does is, in effect, tell you that I'm going to provisionally say that's its essence, but I won't know until the end of the book whether it is.

487
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:55,679
And whether it is or not will depend on whether I can make a totally coherent understanding of everything that's important about human beings and how it all hangs together using that as my clue.

488
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:12,960
Now, but he's not, as you're saying, talking about natural kinds like electricity and gold and heat, but he's talking about some other thing, which are other something, which has its own essential structure, he thinks.

489
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,839
And he thinks that Dasein has an essential structure.

490
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,479
But now we have to find the places, the two places.

491
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,959
Now, since I decided not to talk about RISA designation, I know how to find the best one.

492
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:32,919
The very beginning of the second part of Division II, where he summarizes what he's done, it comes out clearly.

493
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,999
The translation sort of messes it up.

494
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:50,199
So here, if you get to page 231, which is, that's the German, if you get, that's 274, you see him making just the RISA designation or formal indication move.

495
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:53,159
See, he says about six lines down.

496
00:47:53,159 --> 00:48:03,720
When we came to analyze this being, namely Dasein, we took as our clue existence, which in anticipation we designated as the essence of Dasein.

497
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:10,199
This term existence formally indicates that Dasein is an understanding.

498
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:15,719
Well, potentiality for being is very bad, but ability to be is better, but we won't worry about that right now.

499
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:20,600
There's an understanding ability to be, which in its being makes an issue of itself.

500
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,199
So what he's saying there is just what I said he was saying.

501
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:33,800
He's going to take and give some description of what its essence is, that he understands, even here when he's summarizing all of Division I, it's still provisional.

502
00:48:33,799 --> 00:48:38,199
It stays provisional, in fact, never gets unprovisional because he never finishes being in time.

503
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:40,519
But he gets far enough.

504
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:50,920
I'm going to tell you by the end of the lecture if I make it to there, if not next time, what the whole picture was going to be that would have put it all together and why it's called being in time.

505
00:48:51,199 --> 00:49:08,239
But uh but right now, that's enough about formal indication, except for one further thing, which wouldn't won't be relevant until we get to Division II, is that Heidegger thinks that we have generally a tendency to cover up the real essence of things, particularly if it's somehow disturbing to us.

506
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:15,759
So that when he talks about guilt, when he talks about death, he starts out with a definition of them in our ordinary way.

507
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:22,239
And he shows radically that death means practically the opposite of what we think it means, or what it indicates.

508
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:31,679
Death indicates the essential something that death indicates is entirely different than what we think, that it's some psych, like my student John Hoagland used to say, croaking.

509
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:34,880
That is some kind of event that happens at the end of your life.

510
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:39,439
Anyway, so and he does it, he does it with time even.

511
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,559
He does it with language.

512
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,120
And now comes this exception.

513
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:49,360
That's why I'm saying it just so happens that he really would make no sense to begin this book with the wrong definition.

514
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:55,679
So he has to say that provisionally he happens to luck out and get the right one, because he's written the whole book already.

515
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:03,519
But he does want to answer you and say that even though he happens to get the right one, he doesn't claim it's the right one.

516
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,120
He claims it's provisional.

517
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,679
Good.

518
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:05,999
Yeah.

519
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:11,999
Definitely.

520
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:26,159
That it will account, just as you want gold, just as the molecular theory of heat's going to have to account for every important thing that heat does, not accidental things like be extra strong in the Congo or something, but all the sort of physical things.

521
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:32,479
And so yes, he's got to account for every important aspect of human being before he can say that.

522
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:43,919
And one of the things he's got to do, this is what I'm going to try to say briefly at the end, is show how the three modes of being are all rightly called modes of being.

523
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,199
What do they have in common?

524
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:50,640
It doesn't look like they have anything in common, but readiness to hand, presence of hand, and existence.

525
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:54,520
But then how come they're all called modes of being?

526
00:50:55,319 --> 00:51:01,640
If he can do that, then he's ready to say, Yeah, I got it right with my provisional indication.

527
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,320
Okay.

528
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,679
Ready to go on?

529
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:05,640
Let's go on.

530
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:07,959
There's so many loose ends.

531
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:14,120
I thought I should tell you sort of whether you are DASIN when you're brushing your teeth.

532
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,720
We left that one aside.

533
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:21,320
Have I said anything in the meantime that's supposed to help you understand, or me understand, that?

534
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:32,360
I don't know whether.

535
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:35,239
Yeah, I see maybe that that's the wrong kind of question.

536
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:38,840
And then I keep falling into it, and that was a it's a kind of trap.

537
00:51:38,839 --> 00:52:01,480
I mean, you want to know whether the style of being, say, of being nurturing or being aggressive, or now our style of being, Heidegger says, is to have a technological understanding of being, whether that shows up when you're brushing your teeth, whether the Japanese brush their teeth in a nurturing way and we brush our teeth in a technological way, I wouldn't be surprised.

538
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:13,399
But anyway, it's not the right problem to ask here, because the question here is, of course, it shows up when you're brushing your teeth, because you're using equipment to brush your teeth.

539
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,640
And we're not talking about styles of being, we're talking about modes of being.

540
00:52:18,279 --> 00:52:28,279
So I never should let myself ask myself how much the Daseine way of being permeates everything.

541
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:41,040
The Dasein way of being is manifest in everything we do when we're using equipment or when we're staring at things or when we're taking up our culture's understanding of being and acting on it.

542
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:42,079
Period.

543
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,720
Now, back to this.

544
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,159
Where are we?

545
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,879
I'm going to give you some terminology.

546
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,839
I was way, I'm on the first half of page one of my lecture, but that's all right.

547
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,040
So the next thing I wanted to talk about was just terminological things.

548
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,520
Heidegger talks about existential and existentiale.

549
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:09,359
You've got to get used to all these variations on existence because existence is very important for Heidegger.

550
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:18,239
So back to page 32, page 12, where he says, I hope, though I don't see it yet.

551
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,720
Hmm, maybe he does.

552
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,959
Somebody, when you see existential, let me tell you about it.

553
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,080
Oh, here it is, 33.

554
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,520
I got it wrong.

555
00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:38,240
Okay, so at the top of 33, still on page 12.

556
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:44,240
Dasein always understands itself in terms of its existence, in terms of a possibility of itself.

557
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:51,280
All that's pretty abstract, and I can't help to make it any clearer than I've done it, so I won't say more.

558
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,239
To be itself or not itself, that's certainly not going to help.

559
00:53:54,239 --> 00:54:06,159
Dasein, at this stage of what we're talking about, that Dasein has already chosen the possibilities of itself or got into them or growing up in them already.

560
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:10,079
That's, do I have to talk about that?

561
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,479
That's division two issues.

562
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,360
That's whether Dasein is going to be authentic or not.

563
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:37,880
That is whether Dasein is going to manifest in its behavior some particular cultural understanding of what its essence is, or whether it's going to manifest in its behavior that it has no essence, so that he can't draw conclusions about how to live as a rational animal or a creature of gods and so forth.

564
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:44,439
And that's got to get settled by each particular Dasein's way of being, again, without thinking about it.

565
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,600
Presumably, the German peasants already do this right.

566
00:54:49,960 --> 00:55:03,720
But whatever you want to say is, and we've got to just deal with it because he talks about it here, that when you're talking about what some particular Dasein's stand on its being, that's existential.

567
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:17,640
When you talk about the general structure of a being whose way of being is existence, then that's existential.

568
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,759
That's just what he's doing.

569
00:55:18,759 --> 00:55:29,239
You see, he talks about the existential, and then he goes, the question about the structure, I've stepped down a little, aims at the analysis of what constitutes existence.

570
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:32,920
The context of such structures we call existentiality.

571
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:39,800
It's analytic, has the character of an understanding which is not existential, but existential.

572
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:47,159
And so this whole book, all of it, is an existential analytic.

573
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:56,360
It's an attempt to lay out the whole structure of the way of being, which is existence.

574
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,839
And that's to do an existential analytic, and that's just so you get used to that.

575
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,479
And it's not, and it doesn't have to do with reflecting and believing, and that's where I was going to talk about the Japanese baby that I did.

576
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:44,880
But I did want to read a place, I keep saying that it's important that we don't have to, and the Japanese baby does illustrate it in a way, is we get socialized into all of our practices, that is, are manifesting our understanding of being, but also manifesting the style of our understanding of being, and also manifesting whether we understand that we don't really have a nature, that is, that existence is our essence.

577
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:52,800
All of that is something that we just pick up from the culture.

578
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:59,920
On the bottom of 213, it happens, but I think it's important to see how he mentions it here.

579
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:01,920
He doesn't talk about it much.

580
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:04,080
This is the bottom of 213.

581
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,560
It's in the German 169, about two sentences into the paragraph that begins this way.

582
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:24,640
This everyday way in which things have been interpreted is one in which Gasein has grown in, has grown in, and I think the better way to translate the German here is has grown into from the start.

583
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:29,040
You could translate it from the first instance, but it just wouldn't make any sense.

584
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:36,399
It's one in which Gasein has grown into from the start, that's the Japanese baby, with never a possibility of extrication.

585
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,399
It's always going to have that style.

586
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:47,360
In it, out of it, and against it, all genuine understanding, interpreting, and communication, all rediscovering and appropriating is performed.

587
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:53,719
And so that's just part of saying we're always in an understanding of being.

588
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:58,600
Now it's important to make another, did I say that wrong again?

589
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,599
I'm falling back into later Heidegger.

590
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:07,960
We are always in, how does he say here, a way of interpreting Daseine.

591
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,199
So we're always in a way of interpreting Dasein.

592
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:14,040
That's what it is to exist.

593
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,880
You never can step out of it.

594
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:23,640
You're always doing what you're doing, even rebelling inside of it, and so forth.

595
00:58:24,279 --> 00:58:31,960
And now another distinction that you need between facticity and factuality.

596
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:44,439
Because now you want to say, and probably if I let you have time, somebody would say that, well, but there are features of human beings that don't seem to have anything to do with this whole interpreting business.

597
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,040
I mean, let's take an example being male or female.

598
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,400
That's just the characteristic of us as organisms.

599
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,320
We've got, and that's Heidegger said, yes, that's factuality.

600
00:58:57,319 --> 00:59:15,400
But what's interesting about us, and this is sort of related to whether you're brushing your teeth or not in the style of your culture, is that all the factuality about us gets taken up and interpreted if we're a dodzine and because our mode of being is existence.

601
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,559
So for instance, male turns into masculine.

602
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,479
And different cultures, this is the gender business.

603
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:36,720
Different cultures will have different ways of understanding the gender, masculine and feminine, even though the biological facts that there are males and females is cross-cultural.

604
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,719
And so Heidegger has a notion of facticity, he calls it.

605
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:54,720
Facticity is sort of the way of understanding yourself in your behavior that you're stuck with given the culture that you're raised.

606
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:09,279
So you're stuck with pretty much, and you can vary it a bit and rebel against it a bit, a certain understanding of masculinity, whether you never thought about it or not, and you couldn't ever get to the bottom of it if you did think about it, because it's so pervasive in how you stand.

607
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:25,840
There was a time when I first came to Berkeley when there were a lot of consciousness raising groups, and women and then later men too tried to understand sort of what all they had taken up from their culture in their facticity and particularly in their gender.

608
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,520
And I think they've stopped.

609
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:36,560
And I think the reason they've stopped, as far as I can make out, now they're not hundreds of consciousness raising groups, I don't think, is probably some people think, well, they sort of answered it.

610
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:42,080
They understand how women enter conversations differently than men and throw baseballs differently than men and so forth.

611
01:00:42,080 --> 01:01:13,119
But I like to think that the reason they stopped is that they understood that they're never going to get to the bottom of it, that everything they can discover is is relatively superficial and what they can't notice is the sort of the tip of the iceberg, and that there's so much in in the in just in the in the whole way of dealing with things that is different because that's the way our culture does it, that that um they that and that there's no reason to think you would ever get to the bottom of understanding the style.

612
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:20,839
It's that this is again the sense of sort of Heidegger seeing that there's something very basic that you can't take up and make explicit.

613
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,800
You can have to, you manifest it all the time.

614
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,999
Oh, that's the next thing to say.

615
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:33,400
You manifest it all the time, but it is so pervasive and so embodied that you can't make it explicit.

616
01:01:34,279 --> 01:01:35,479
It isn't a belief system.

617
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,080
We don't have a belief system about what it is to be masculine in our culture.

618
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,080
That would be an American.

619
01:01:41,319 --> 01:01:42,279
That's a joke.

620
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:47,640
I mean, it's got very little to do with what we believe, and probably what we believe isn't even right about it.

621
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,640
So, what is going on there that Heidegger's getting at?

622
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,239
I have certain, I've just forgotten where I'm heading with this, just a second.

623
01:02:04,279 --> 01:02:05,480
So, it's so pervasive.

624
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,159
Oh, that's what I want to talk about.

625
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,879
Ah, yes.

626
01:02:09,879 --> 01:02:10,359
Okay.

627
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:15,400
Heidegger's words for this is that it's nearest and furthest away.

628
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:37,159
What our facticity, our particular style of interpreting our way of being, namely existence in all of our activity, is so obvious, so close to us, that we couldn't, we got it sort of right, so to speak, in front of us, except it isn't in front of us, it's all around us.

629
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:59,400
And it's so much like the water to the fish, it is so much all around us that just because it's nearest and pervades everything we do, and there's no counterclass of things and so forth, that makes it the hardest to see and the furthest away.

630
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,919
And Heidegger's not trying to do that job in being in time.

631
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,279
That is, get at what it is to be a German or what it is to be masculine or anything like that.

632
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:20,400
Though later, Heidegger has definitely got himself into this interesting business of trying to see what is nearest and furthest away, namely the style of our existence in the West.

633
01:03:21,279 --> 01:03:28,480
But I don't know where I could, I mean, I've gone so far from my notes that I don't know whether I'll ever see again nearest and furthest away.

634
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,679
Oh, here we are.

635
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:36,080
I'm asking myself, oh, no, it's too, I'll have to come back to it.

636
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,920
I jumped ahead.

637
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,719
So let me go and do what I really want to do.

638
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:46,000
We've got to get the fundamental ontology right away, as David brought it up.

639
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,799
So I'm going to do it by giving you again definitions.

640
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:58,480
So ontic, as we come across it every once in a while, has to do with entities, properties, characteristics of entities.

641
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,159
Ontological has to do with the way of being.

642
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:10,480
And it could, and preontological has to do with acting out the way of being without thinking about it.

643
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:13,120
Let's see now.

644
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:15,359
Yeah.

645
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,519
And now comes the tricky thing.

646
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,000
What is fundamental ontology?

647
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,879
Well, it turns out, and you've been prepared for this by me very well, I think.

648
01:04:24,879 --> 01:04:34,719
That is, it turns out that we, in our behavior, as we take a stand on our existence, it's better to be specific.

649
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:42,000
As I understand myself as a professor, I use lots of stuff.

650
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,159
That is, I take up things as equipment.

651
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:54,759
That is, I manifest my understanding of being, of the kind of being of readiness to hand.

652
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,999
And thanks to the fact that I do that, there is that kind of being called readiness to hand.

653
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:06,120
Being equipment doesn't just sort of lie around, whether any people are there or not.

654
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:16,920
It's only because we're here using equipment to do things in order to understand the kind of being that we are that there is readiness to hand.

655
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:25,959
And because we're also the kind of being that can, when we get into a problem, for instance, stare at things, look at their properties, try to put the blob back on the wood on the hammer.

656
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:30,520
We have this capacity to study substances.

657
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:33,879
And that's so there is presence at hand.

658
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:51,080
And we are the being that, so to speak, constitutes or generates, I don't know what the right word ought to be, produces, I just don't know.

659
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:56,359
I think maybe in a Heidegger jargon discloses, let's just use Heidegger's argument.

660
01:05:56,359 --> 01:06:00,679
We are the kind of being that discloses all three ways of being.

661
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:04,360
Readiness to hand, presence of hand, existence.

662
01:06:04,359 --> 01:06:10,040
And that's the sense in which when you do fundamental ontology, what do you do?

663
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,120
You study the being that is the basis for all the ontology.

664
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:20,760
That's on page 34 at the very top, 13 in the German, toward the bottom.

665
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:28,439
Therefore, fundamental ontology, from which all other ontologies can take their eyes, must be sought in the existential analytic of Dausheim.

666
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,919
So you know what an existential analytic is?

667
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,560
It's lying out the structure of existence.

668
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:52,560
You know that if you work out the structure of existence, you'll understand why it is that we have these three ways of understanding being, all of which, therefore, one, they depend on us, and two, we have to say something about them.

669
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:58,799
But I'm just going to blurt out a sentence about their depending on us, because they're going to spend a lot of time on it later.

670
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:07,920
Ivan, if I told you that modes of being depend on us, and does that make you, does that make Heidegger a kind of idealist?

671
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,000
And the answer is no.

672
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:19,840
Heidegger says, and I just don't want to take time to find the pages, way later in the book, that being depends on us, but beings don't.

673
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:29,519
That means that there is a mode of being called readiness to hand, and a mode of being we're going to call presence of hand, and a mode of being called existence depends on us.

674
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,799
And there wouldn't be any mode of being like that.

675
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:38,079
The things just wouldn't, there wouldn't be any intelligibility like that if it weren't for us.

676
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,719
Intelligibility depends on us.

677
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:44,640
But that whether there are any hammers or not doesn't depend on us.

678
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,360
We could make sense of hammers and there wouldn't be any.

679
01:07:47,359 --> 01:08:00,559
Or there could be things around that we don't have any knowledge of, and they're still there, and they still, but what their mode of being is, it's going to be something relative to Dasein.

680
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:06,560
Yes, one.

681
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,239
For fundamental ontology, it's the top of page 34.

682
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,560
I wish I could tell you about being depending on us since I just got there.

683
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,799
Just a second.

684
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:15,999
Anybody know?

685
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:28,439
Well, then I will, but I do want to say something real fast, which will be too fast, but at least you can think it over, because I promised it.

686
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,959
And I'm trying to find where I do it so I can do it as quickly as possible.

687
01:08:31,959 --> 01:08:32,919
Here we go.

688
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,719
Oh, this boy, I can't resist telling you that.

689
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:49,079
So on page 37, German, I don't know what, 15, I guess, where this closest and furthest away is.

690
01:08:49,079 --> 01:09:00,679
Dasein is ontically closest to itself and to itself, and ontologically farthest, and pre-ontologically, it is not a strange, that is, you've got to work on it.

691
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:07,640
Okay, but here's what I want to say when you say that you've got to have a whole unified theory of all this now.

692
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,159
So how does it work?

693
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:23,640
Well, the structure of Dasein is to make sense of things and to make sense, or to make sense of itself by using things, and by, so that I'm using things to be a professor and so forth.

694
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:29,959
And when you do that, you discover, you discover there are these three modes of being.

695
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:34,279
The equipmental stuff, the stuff that are substances, and us.

696
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:46,520
And now the final question you have to ask is, why are there these three, and only in exactly three understandings of being?

697
01:09:46,839 --> 01:10:06,159
And now you begin to get a glimmer, maybe, that if you could put this in terms of time, somehow, which has three dimensions, past, present, and future, you would understand something about the threefold structure of everything.

698
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:10,719
Now, I'm not even going to try to explain that, but I want to try to tell you one more weird thing.

699
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:15,759
Don't feel you need to know this or understand what I'm saying, but I think I promised it.

700
01:10:15,759 --> 01:10:31,759
So, we want to know why there are three, and we do that, and you can't say it's because it's temporal, but you can say somehow that, well, you know that you got it all right, that there are three and only three, if you could map it onto time, which is very fundamental and has three dimensions.

701
01:10:31,759 --> 01:10:32,959
But here's a tougher one.

702
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,719
And I said I was going to tell you how they were all unified.

703
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:38,240
That's the really hard part.

704
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,719
How come these are the three understandings of being?

705
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,879
What do they have in common?

706
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:50,879
Well, obviously, if Heidegger's going to make it work, they've got to all have temporality in common.

707
01:10:51,839 --> 01:10:53,359
But how would that work?

708
01:10:53,360 --> 01:11:05,199
Well, each of the three kinds of being would have one of the three modes of temporality, which is pretty far-fetched, but this is what Heidegger thinks.

709
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:12,159
Dasein is what he calls primordial temporality.

710
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:25,520
And it's haven't said it right.

711
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:34,879
There are three different, for each of the three modes of being, there is a kind of unity.

712
01:11:34,879 --> 01:11:36,239
That's what I have to say.

713
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:45,279
What unifies them all is temporality because for each of the three, there is a unity of temporal, a temporal kind of unity.

714
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:56,199
And the temporal kind of unity is what he calls primordial temporality, which is the temporal structure of what you get in the existential analytic, and you'll get that.

715
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:02,919
Then there's the temporal structure of what one could call pragmatic time.

716
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,119
It's the time of equipment and coping.

717
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,879
And in a way, you already get that.

718
01:12:11,879 --> 01:12:16,679
And then there's a kind of time which are the kind that you're used to on clocks.

719
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:23,719
A now time of this moment and then that moment, next, and that moment, the past, present, and future in that sense.

720
01:12:23,879 --> 01:12:28,039
And that's also got its kind of unity.

721
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:32,439
So now, I mean, I know you're just puzzled, and don't worry about it.

722
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:51,239
I just promise to tell you that the reason he thinks that he's got it right when he provisionally designates the Dasein is the being who is existence, and when he says existence, its essence is existence, he owes you a big picture of how all this hangs together.

723
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:59,319
And the big picture of how it all hangs together is that there are three modes of temporality, each of which is unified.

724
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:03,879
And all of them are unified because, and I haven't said this yet, they are derived from each other.

725
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:18,759
So primordial temporality enables you to understand pragmatic coping temporality of equipment, which enables you to understand the moment-by-moment temporality of the ordinary physical world.

726
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:21,640
One question, but it's probably not time to answer.

727
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,480
President at hand temporality is clock time or now time.

728
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,520
I didn't say that.

729
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,839
It's just this minute and this second and this second.

730
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,439
It's the kind of time you're used to.

731
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,959
The other two kinds of time, Heidegger has to convince you that they're around.

732
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,159
Okay.

733
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,719
Yeah.

734
01:13:41,759 --> 01:13:51,999
Yes, if you came in late and you didn't fill out a card, come up right now and fill it out, because you've got to know to do that, or you won't be in sections and then you won't be in the course.
