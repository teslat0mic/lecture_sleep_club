1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,839
So here we are at the end of Division 1, in which we're being told that something about the relation of primordial truth, which is, I'm just going to call it truth from now on.

2
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,159
But remember, there are two meanings of truth.

3
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:25,199
The ordinary meaning when ontic propositions or assertions are about some ontic something or other.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,039
That's not what we're going to talk about.

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:35,599
Primordial truth is, in some way, surely, the background practices that make ontic truth possible.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,279
And the question is, how does that relate to being?

7
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:44,479
So primordial truth is disclosiveness, I take it.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,439
Or, yeah, well, I'm already puzzled.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,999
I see it before I realized I was going to be.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,479
I don't really know, and it may wobble in what I'm going to say, whether primordial truth is disclosiveness or is, I think that's what it is.

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:16,759
I was starting to say it's the practices that bring about disclosedness, but I think that, the practices that bring about disclosedness, is more like the understanding of being.

12
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:17,799
But we'll get to that.

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:32,759
Anyway, let's say primordial truth is disclosedness, that on the basis of which beings are uncovered as they are, and that it makes possible encountering anything.

14
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,280
And being, now, what is that?

15
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,239
It's very close.

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,280
It's that on the basis.

17
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:47,639
Everything is on, we're all in the on-the-basis of which business, which I always think when you try to keep the phenomena in mind, and if you don't, you'll sort of lose your mind.

18
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:53,080
So keep it, and I think the on-the-basis of which is always the background.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:04,120
And what exactly the background is isn't obvious, but that's the job of the background, is to be in the background and be that on the basis of which something shows up in the foreground.

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,520
So being is that on the basis of which beings are already understood.

21
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,959
We've said that over and over at the bottom of page 25.

22
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,399
I've tried to fill that in with a phenomenon.

23
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:23,959
I would say being is background coping or maybe more exactly familiarity.

24
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:34,280
Familiarity seems to be the name for the way the background practices add up to making things intelligible.

25
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,159
That's the last thing.

26
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:44,279
So being is that, remember, on the basis of which beings are already understood, that is, are intelligible, makes sense.

27
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:49,319
What is it on the basis of which beings are already understood and make sense?

28
00:02:49,319 --> 00:03:01,839
Well, it's, I take it, I hope, familiarity with how things go in the world and how to get around in the world and how to deal with chairs and doors and people and assertions and all that.

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,199
That's all comes under being, or maybe understanding of being.

30
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,879
I have a very hard time getting clear about the difference between being and the understanding of being.

31
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:21,519
I mean, so does Heidegger in a way, because every once in a while he'll be using one phrase or the other, seemingly interchangeably.

32
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:31,360
We may, if anybody has anything helpful to say about this, come to office hours and tell me about how to distinguish being from the understanding of being.

33
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:42,480
My last office hours are this coming Wednesday, 2 to 4, as usual, and I hope to see some of the familiar people who come and tell me about things then.

34
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,120
So, both, and now, how is truth and being going to be related?

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,759
Well, there's a further sort of way they're related.

36
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:02,879
They both depend on Daseine, and Dasein's taking a stand on its own being, that is Dasein's coping.

37
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,520
And that's what's happening here on page 272.

38
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,759
We're now on the last two pages of Division I.

39
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:20,560
Division I has really done this whole story already, which we're going to hear about in Introduction I in a minute.

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:39,399
And then he's summing it up, where it says 232 in the margin: the being of truth is connected primordially with Dasein, and only because Dasein is as constituted by disclosiveness, that is, by understanding, see, all these seem to come together, can anything like being be understood?

41
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:43,480
Only so is it possible to understand being.

42
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,159
It's tied up a lot with understanding.

43
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,839
It's tied up a lot with Dasein's disclosing.

44
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:58,120
I used to think, but I'll tell you now why I think it's wrong, that being equals intelligibility.

45
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:07,319
I think being is close to having, has a lot to do with intelligibility, but being doesn't equal intelligibility for reasons I'll explain later.

46
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,959
Right now, I just want to read the next sentence here.

47
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,040
I think I did already last time.

48
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:19,959
Being, not entities, is something which there is, in quotes, only insofar as truth is.

49
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,319
That is what?

50
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:36,600
That you can only understand everything and make sense of things on the basis of the fact that they're disclosed.

51
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:43,879
So I think truth discloses them, and then being makes sense of them.

52
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:57,399
These are all such sort of razor-thinned distinctions, but I'm not sure there are distinctions at all, but I have to keep saying them in the hope that I'll get clear about them and that you'll at least have something to go on.

53
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:23,360
So I think truth is disclosing, and disclosing makes it possible to make sense of things, and being, which has to do with making sense of things, and is some way that we're familiar with being is well, that on the way, basis of which being are understood.

54
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:29,360
Whatever it is that forms the background, which enables us to make sense of things, that's the job of being.

55
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,560
And whatever opens up a world so that there is a background and we can there are things and we can make sense of them.

56
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,040
The disclosing side of it is truth.

57
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,000
So let's go on.

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,159
Being not entities is something which there is only insofar as truth is, and truth is only insofar and as long as Dasein is.

59
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,879
Being and truth are equiprimordial.

60
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,959
Well, I've said the best I can about that.

61
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:15,759
And I thought I would try to tell you in sort of really cryptic way what I think these three with the two basic terms and one more, which is meaning, because you're always worrying about the meaning of being.

62
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:28,079
That's another very abstract notion that's very close to both being and truth, because it's also that on the basis of which, et cetera.

63
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,320
They're all on the basis of which business.

64
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,919
That much is sure.

65
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,720
On the basis of disclosedness, on the basis of familiarity.

66
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:42,560
And now I think meaning is the formal on the basis of which structure.

67
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,160
Because meaning is the formal something or other on the basis of which anything shows up as anything.

68
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,040
I wasn't going to read it.

69
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,919
Now I want to read it.

70
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,080
Help me find meaning in here.

71
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,240
Did I write down when I wrote down?

72
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,079
No, I just said.

73
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,199
So meaning is an I write after understanding.

74
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,760
So let's everybody find it for me.

75
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,920
Here it is.

76
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:24,840
Okay, meaning at the top of 193 is the, in italics, is the on the basis of which of a projection, in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something.

77
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,280
Boy, is that formal.

78
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,280
So meaning is just the background, the structure of the background.

79
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,120
That's the sense in which it's a formal something or other.

80
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:45,160
Formal, by the way, never means something like informal logic, something present at hand and completely detached from the context.

81
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,520
Formal means abstract, and boy, is this abstract.

82
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:56,280
This is the most abstract existential framework story of, and it's very similar to being.

83
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,520
But I'll try to make the distinction this way.

84
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,760
Meaning is the formal structure of all backgrounds, of all on the basis of which is.

85
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:10,920
Being is the content of that formal structure.

86
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:21,639
It's the background practices themselves, the actual practices, the familiarity, something like that, on the basis of which beings are already understood.

87
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,040
That's not formal anymore.

88
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,360
I mean, that's what fills in the on the basis of which is familiarity.

89
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,560
I think the nearest thing to doing the job of being is familiarity.

90
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,640
I mean, think about that, about a room.

91
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,920
What is it on the basis of which rooms and everything in the rooms are understood?

92
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,160
Well, it's familiarity with rooms.

93
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:50,760
And remember, Heidegger then goes and says, and moreover, we've got a familiarity with the world so that we can find our way around in the world.

94
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,840
That would seem to me to be very close, at least, to what being's job is.

95
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,360
And what is truth?

96
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:01,280
Well, truth is the function of the background practice.

97
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:05,680
So you've got the form of them, that's meaning, the content of them is being.

98
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,520
This is an attempt.

99
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,920
Primordial truth is their function.

100
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,040
What is their function?

101
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,120
Well, it's disclosing.

102
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,880
That's their job.

103
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:25,680
So that all the other, so that there can be being, and there can be meaning, and you've got to have a disclosing activity.

104
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:29,600
And we are that disclosing activity.

105
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
And we are this primordial truth.

106
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,480
Dasein is in the truth.

107
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,720
Dasein is in the truth business, I think.

108
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,440
Remember, he says Dasein is in the truth.

109
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,079
That means Dasein is in the truth business.

110
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,520
What is the truth business?

111
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,719
It's disclosing.

112
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,399
That's how he defines truth.

113
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:57,360
It's opening up a space, a world, a clearing in which things can show up and be understood.

114
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:05,040
Okay, now I finished Division I with that incomprehensible summary.

115
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,840
That prepares you for the incomprehensible details which are in the first introduction.

116
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:25,920
One of the morals of this is that it would be just insane to think that you could read this introduction, which is sort of starting right where we left off now, if you hadn't read all of Division I first.

117
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:28,880
So that's why we read Division I first.

118
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,200
And now we have a fighting chance of making some sense of the introduction.

119
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:41,480
And we start on page 25, which is our favorite page, my favorite page, which is that at the bottom, remember.

120
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,560
We're going to ask, the introduction is going to ask about being.

121
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,760
The name of this section on 24 is the formal structure of the question of being.

122
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:58,840
And we're going to work out what is asked about, namely being.

123
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:07,959
And now comes that which determines entities as entities, that on the basis of which entities are already understood.

124
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:20,280
That's this very, if you just think of this as the background figure, the figure ground structure, that there's always a background on the basis of which there is a foreground.

125
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,600
That's behind all, that's the phenomena behind all of this.

126
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:36,920
I keep wanting to say you will lose your wits and it will just be spinning of fancy terms, as most books about Heidegger are, if you don't, as he says, if you don't pay attention to the phenomenon.

127
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,480
And that's what I'm trying to do.

128
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:48,279
Okay, now we have things get clear for a while because now he's going to tell us what the wrong way to answer the question of being is.

129
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,720
And that's kind of fun.

130
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,800
What being isn't.

131
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,040
That's what happens next.

132
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,880
And he starts talking about that on 26.

133
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:13,640
And it's just great what being isn't, because being isn't what all, in various ways, traditional metaphysicians have, and theologians have thought being was, from Plato on, at least.

134
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,200
I think strictly from Plato on.

135
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,880
And what is that?

136
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,839
Well, that's the idea that being is some kind of supreme being.

137
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,840
Heidegger calls that onto theology.

138
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:45,120
That is, it's turning this onto, which is being, into a story about the supreme being that could be God, but it could be the good in Plato, could be the transcendental unity of our perception in Kant, could be the master monad of keeping everything in order in Leibniz.

139
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:53,840
There are all kinds of candidates in the tradition for that supreme being that sometimes they say created everything.

140
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,879
That's the Hebrew supreme being.

141
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,440
But sometimes in Plato, things have never been created.

142
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,880
They've been there forever.

143
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,200
But then in Plato, the supreme being is what makes things intelligible.

144
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,200
It gives out the light in which we could see things like the sun.

145
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,199
And so all of those ways of thinking are wrong.

146
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,280
And you're just supposed to think that, well, it's a big mistake.

147
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,000
The tradition just got it wrong.

148
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:27,440
Then forget it and go on and try to understand what they should have meant by being.

149
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,840
But I better read you something.

150
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:49,359
So that means if you are doing traditional metaphysical, onto theological stuff, then there's a beingist being that creates all the others God or makes them all intelligible.

151
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,040
And I gave you a whole list of that.

152
00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:03,600
The important thing is to see that those are all ways of telling a story about tracing being back to some source that in some way produces it.

153
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:07,480
And that story he talks about, he mentions on 26.

154
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,880
I just want to tell you that's the wrong way to think about it.

155
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:16,199
So, right where we stop, it's the being of entities is not itself an entity.

156
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,719
That's the top of 26.

157
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,599
See, that's the mistake of onto theology.

158
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:23,240
The supreme being is a being.

159
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:29,160
And being is what makes it possible for there to be beings and to us for us to encounter beings.

160
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,600
It can't, being can't be a being.

161
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:37,400
So the being of entities is not itself an entity.

162
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:46,200
If we are to understand the problem of being, our first philosophical step consists in not, I don't know what the Greek says, but the English says, in not telling a story.

163
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,360
That is, tracing everything back to this source.

164
00:15:50,359 --> 00:16:00,520
That is to say, in not defining entities as entities by tracing them back to their origin, some other entities, as if being had the character of some possible entity.

165
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,959
So that's good.

166
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,120
We get that out of the way.

167
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,000
And there are other interesting mistakes.

168
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:19,400
So also, what being isn't is the totality of entities.

169
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:24,599
And I don't know where he says this anywhere, but it's certainly clear that he believes this.

170
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:34,359
And the totality of entities story leads you to the kind of question that, oh, why is there something rather than nothing?

171
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,959
And I tell you about that, not because he says that in here.

172
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,320
He doesn't say that in here.

173
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,759
That's why I'm telling you.

174
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,799
Some very, I'm afraid, not very bright people like George Steiner.

175
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,360
I don't know, he may be bright about something else, but he's not bright about Heidegger.

176
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,759
He thinks that the whole wonderful thing is that Heidegger has raised the question, why is there something rather than nothing?

177
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,920
He hasn't answered it, but at least he raised it.

178
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:02,879
Well, he never raised it, and he certainly didn't answer it because he doesn't think it's the right question.

179
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,760
He goes on and on about why is there something rather than nothing in one of his books, because he's talking about Leibniz.

180
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:16,160
And he's talking about how traditional philosophers get themselves into this position of asking why there's something rather than nothing.

181
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,440
Is this the best world, as in Leibniz, and God being good would naturally create the best world?

182
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,160
That's one answer to why there's something rather than nothing.

183
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,239
Heidegger doesn't have any answer to it.

184
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:29,839
He doesn't think it makes any sense to ask that question.

185
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,999
And so don't read Steiner.

186
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,039
I don't have him on my list, but it looks tempting, a nice little book that can explain all of Heidegger.

187
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,959
So Heidegger now wants to get behind all these ontic misunderstandings of being.

188
00:17:47,279 --> 00:18:04,400
Another one, which now I'm going beyond just telling you what the book says, I think he also wants to get out of the idea that being is some kind of conceptual structure that makes there be a world by organizing everything.

189
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,080
The Kantian story.

190
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
We really haven't told the Kantian story.

191
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:14,479
The transcendental unity of apperception is a sort of a super being, but it's not really a being.

192
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:26,319
But what's really going on is the categories are organizing the world, and that might be the wrong.

193
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,359
I'm worried about the bottom of 25.

194
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:45,559
I worry about it every year because the difference between Blattner and the reading of Heidegger of being in time and mind, everything hinges on a struggle between us over that sentence.

195
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:56,920
Remember, Blattner thinks that Heidegger is a Kantian idealist, and he thinks the evidence for that is the phrase, that which determines entities as entities.

196
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,199
That's being.

197
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:06,759
And that means being would be this conceptual structure that sort of puts a form on some kind of amorphousness.

198
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:14,039
And I can't believe that that's what that first half of the sentence means.

199
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:20,039
If it did, then that on the basis of which entities are already understood would be Kant's 12 categories.

200
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:20,920
And that would make sense.

201
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:22,199
You could read it that way.

202
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:25,479
That's how Bill Blattner's going to read it.

203
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:37,400
I want to say, no, that which determines entities as entities means that background which lets entities show up as foreground.

204
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,559
I mean, it could mean that.

205
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,440
And if it did mean that, then I'd be right.

206
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,440
And Heidegger wouldn't be a Kantian idealist.

207
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:56,759
And Blattner would be sort of blaming him for having a view which he can't, which he thinks Heidegger can't maintain because it's wrong, namely his temporal idealism.

208
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:19,640
Now, when we get in, when those of you come on to the next time, we'll see that there has to be a long, constant battle between whoever, me or you all, whoever's in the course, in Division II, because Blattner's got this basically different, and I think wrong view, and yet he's written the best book on being in time by far that anybody's ever written.

209
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,239
So you have to sort of take the good and save it from maybe what's wrong.

210
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:29,199
My only evidence that there's something wrong, but I have some, is on page 26.

211
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:41,760
I mean, that which determines entities as entities had better not be a conceptual structure, because Heidegger specifically says that being is not a conceptual structure.

212
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,079
On 26, I'll show you.

213
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,079
And the categories are how many have Kant?

214
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,479
I forget.

215
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,680
I hoped a lot of people.

216
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,239
Well, the categories are a conceptual structure.

217
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:58,719
And this is what he says on 26, which is, I take it on my side, the first full paragraph.

218
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:06,160
Insofar as being constitutes what is asked about, and being means, well, that's not what I want.

219
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,039
Let's see why I haven't found what I want.

220
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,519
Round there somewhere is that it's not conceptual.

221
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:21,199
Somebody find talk about conceptual.

222
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:23,839
I've got it wrong page or something.

223
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,279
Oh, here, maybe.

224
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,959
Maybe it's right up there.

225
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:29,199
I think it is there, about ten lines down.

226
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:44,479
Accordingly, what is to be found out about by asking, namely the meaning of being, also demands that it be conceived in a way of its own, essentially contrasting with the concepts in which entities acquire their determinate significance.

227
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:47,199
Pretty devastating to the Kantian reading.

228
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:53,680
And determine is, I checked it, the German is the same as that which determines entities as entities.

229
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:04,799
So it better be some other meaning of determines because he says we're not going to talk about what gives entities their determinate significance.

230
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,400
So then you have to reread what that phrase, what determines entities as entities, could mean.

231
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:20,839
And I keep saying, try to think of it meaning that being is the background which lets entities show up as foreground.

232
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,959
And then he says, namely, that on the basis of which beings are understood.

233
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:34,680
So these two pieces of that important sentence fit together for me, whereas for Bill, they well, no, they fit together for Bill II, unfortunately.

234
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,800
You can read them either way.

235
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:36,120
Yeah.

236
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,160
Dave, yeah.

237
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,400
That's a problem, isn't it?

238
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,319
How does Bill deal with it?

239
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,400
Well, hmm.

240
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:02,759
There is a transcendental subject, and this is something for next semester.

241
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,360
Primordial temporality.

242
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,759
Of course, it isn't a subject, but it's a transcendence Uberhau, sort of.

243
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,640
It's not going to be a Kantian transcendental subject, applying categories.

244
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,560
And I see what you mean.

245
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,920
Who could think it was?

246
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,839
Whatever it is that you finally find out at the end of being in time is the meaning of being.

247
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,959
It certainly doesn't seem like it could be.

248
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,799
But it can't be.

249
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,800
Well, how about can it be the somehow the application of concepts, never mind who applies them?

250
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:46,359
Somehow there are concepts around and they structure the world.

251
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,239
It's an added bonus to say that it's the the transcendental subject that does it.

252
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,319
But the I don't know.

253
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,839
And it wouldn't work.

254
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,359
Well, we have to go back and read Bill.

255
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,959
Have you read Platinum?

256
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,600
Me too, a long time ago.

257
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,199
Next semester we have to go back.

258
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:18,560
I have to go back and look anyway and see how he manages to convince himself, careful reader that he is, that this is a kind of idealism of that sort.

259
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,199
Yeah.

260
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:31,119
When he's talking about what he might transcend, which has nothing to do with God's object.

261
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:50,719
It simply refers to the fact that he transcendental of yin, that is the attributes of God, for example, transcendental.

262
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,839
Yeah.

263
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:10,640
Yeah, I think it would come to that.

264
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:24,160
But I can't, I don't think that explains why Bill thinks that it's because he ignores that.

265
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:45,080
You've got a kind of tension in being in time, namely the devotion to Aristotle, which Heidegger had always, because Aristotle, as he says in Basic Problems, is the last of the great philosophers who can sort of pursue a problem in the face of the windiness of metaphysics and the wrongness of common sense.

266
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,600
I'm just sort of paraphrasing it.

267
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,199
So you read Aristotle to find out better than anybody except Heidegger.

268
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,879
I mean, I'm talking how it looks to Heidegger.

269
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:11,160
Aristotle better than anybody between Aristotle and Heidegger, who was trying to understand everyday experience and describe it not as it gets covered up in our falling and so forth, but describe it just as it is.

270
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:19,640
And Aristotle also has, we'll see, important ideas about being that Heidegger also likes.

271
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:36,280
But there's this tension, wait a second, between that and the fact that at the last minute Heidegger put all this Kantian terminology into the manuscript, where talking about the condition of the possibility of such and such is not at all an Aristotelian notion, I wouldn't think, and therefore bong.

272
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,320
And so Bill takes the Kantian stuff and runs with it.

273
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:48,519
I tend to, you know, go with the Aristotle side and keep trying to say, let's just look at common sense, everyday familiarity, it's hard enough.

274
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:52,440
And nobody's been able to say much about it.

275
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:52,760
Yeah.

276
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,759
Well, how would we make sense of them?

277
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,480
They're false.

278
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,759
That's how we make sense of them.

279
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,400
Well, that's a good question.

280
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:33,440
I mean, Heidegger is so convinced that this is just totally wrong-headed, the whole onto theological tradition, that I guess he doesn't really argue against it.

281
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,239
He just, what?

282
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:57,839
He just wants to describe our experience of the world and familiarity and what he calls being, and show by describing that, that you don't have to bring in this supreme being who is going to be the source of it all, and sort of make this one kind of a very fast move.

283
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,839
Well, surely we can't understand being as a being.

284
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:07,759
That's what happens if you think of it in terms of God.

285
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:16,160
Then we need something that makes even God show up and able to be an entity, and we don't have anything like that.

286
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:26,319
So he thinks that, and I guess he would appeal to the fact that metaphysics has been in a kind of mess for 2,000 years and that there are endless aporia, as he calls it.

287
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:30,559
Metaphysics constantly gets into contradictions and problems.

288
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:40,559
So Descartes can't get out of it, so Leibniz tries to fix it, but then Leibniz has trouble, Kant says, but Kant says, well, he's finally fixed it.

289
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,079
And of course, Hegel says, Kant's messed it all up, he hasn't got it either, and so forth and so forth.

290
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:57,440
I think Heidegger believes every one of them when they, one, that they've got something right, and two, that they're wrong, I mean, and true, and two, that they've got it right that their predecessor is wrong, right?

291
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,160
Right up to Wittgenstein, who finally just, like Heidegger, says this is just the wrong way to think about it.

292
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,239
But yes.

293
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,719
I can hear you now.

294
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:26,680
You just faded out.

295
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:26,839
What?

296
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,840
Would this be the ground for Kant or Heidegger's Kant?

297
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,119
Well, it's just so complicated.

298
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,999
I don't know what to say.

299
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:43,320
Heidegger deals with Kant a lot in lectures, in many courses, in several courses.

300
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,920
I don't know how many, but three or four at least.

301
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,239
And the whole course is on Kant.

302
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,759
He takes Kant very seriously.

303
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:00,119
You can see why he would, because after all, he thinks that Dasein does play a crucial role in disclosing.

304
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:12,039
And Kant does think that us we are disclosers, only he calls them transcendental subjects who apply the categories.

305
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,719
But I don't want to, I didn't mean to get back into this.

306
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:21,640
And it doesn't prove that there's no God, of course, that Heidegger thinks that metaphysics is wrong.

307
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,319
And it would have helped a lot if he'd said, I guess, more about it.

308
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:34,599
But I think we're supposed to understand that he's going to, he's very influenced by Nietzsche, too.

309
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,680
And he's just going to get along without God and see how much he can explain without God.

310
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,999
And he thinks he can explain everything that needs any explaining.

311
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,319
I'm still worried about this, but I don't know what else to say.

312
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,680
Yeah.

313
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,880
Good, that helps.

314
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:13,039
I mean, he's saying, although they couldn't be true, I mean, metaphysical, I mean, there's just no way you could understand that being was a being.

315
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,760
And in that sense, it's more like incoherent than false.

316
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:18,880
Is that what you think?

317
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,400
Anyway, yeah, it covers up.

318
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,400
All these are sort of assertions.

319
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,440
I feel bad that we don't have any knockdown arguments.

320
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,319
But of course, if there was a knock-down argument that there wasn't any supreme being, that would be a pretty important argument.

321
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,640
We would have to pay a lot of attention to it.

322
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:34,959
Yeah.

323
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:54,560
You think of being as a being, you just, it's a kind of problems like if you try to tell a story and trace it back to its source, then people want to know what's the source of the source.

324
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,799
The old puzzles.

325
00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:00,640
Yeah, the old antinomies that Kant spells out.

326
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,680
It seems it's, I mean, Kant's the best person to go to.

327
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:20,479
If you want arguments that traditional metaphysics is a completely hopeless situation in which there are at least four utterly contradictory theses at the basis of it, then you should look at what's called the antinomies in the Critique of Pure Reason.

328
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:28,400
Kant's got arguments which I've discovered because, as I mentioned, every once in a while, my son is now a sort of definitely preaching kind of Buddhist.

329
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:38,119
And whenever he comes home, he gives me stories about just, sounds just like Kant, about causality, not, couldn't be a way things really are.

330
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,359
Things are really empty, space is incoherent, time is incoherent.

331
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,320
And they're very much like Kant's arguments.

332
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,959
Of course, Buddhists don't believe in a supreme being either.

333
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:52,199
So that there's, I think it's no coincidence, but this isn't anything I can explain.

334
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:56,680
Plato went away for a while and studied something called the mystery of religions.

335
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:03,559
And when he came back, he sounded a lot more like Buddhism than he did when he left, like he had a reincarnation of souls, for instance.

336
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,600
So, but this is not what we're supposed to be talking about.

337
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,199
So, let's get back to this.

338
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,640
Where am I?

339
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:22,600
Okay, so we've got to get rid of, we're not going to talk about the source of beings, the totality of beings, which are running around forever, like in Plato.

340
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,359
We're not going to talk about a basic conceptual structure, as in Kant.

341
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,760
We're going to go on.

342
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:40,280
And the next wrong answer is that being is what all beings have in common.

343
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:48,199
We're going to go back to 22, where he's, I jumped ahead because I wanted to tell you what was wrong before I, in general, before I tell you what's wrong.

344
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:58,600
But specific, he has a view about specific ways to try to deal with being, besides going to onto theology and the Supreme Being story.

345
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:05,720
And the first one on 22 is: it's been maintained that being is the most universal concept.

346
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,759
That's Aristotle.

347
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,199
I mean, Aristotle is not a big fan of onto-theology.

348
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,800
He's sort of got a bit of it, probably because sort of undigested Plato.

349
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:22,959
But he's much more interested in whether being could be a universal characteristic.

350
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:24,400
What would that look like?

351
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,239
Well, it would mean that there was something like beingness.

352
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,400
And what would that be like?

353
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:38,879
Well, you get this sort of story of a hierarchy where you can start, just for example, with collies, kind of dogs.

354
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,599
The collies are kinds of dogs.

355
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,800
So you go up to the next level, which are all sorts of kinds of dogs.

356
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,440
But then dogs are kind of mammals.

357
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,280
So you go up to the next level.

358
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,079
And that's a broader genus of mammals.

359
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,160
An even broader genus is animals.

360
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,320
Even broader is living things.

361
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:01,120
Even broader than that is material things.

362
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,120
And finally, you get to the most broad category of all.

363
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:12,720
Everything has the property beingness or belongs to the genus beingness.

364
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,039
And that's what.

365
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,280
And now, why is that wrong?

366
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,600
Well, that's what Adam was talking about.

367
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,720
Heidegger talks about the same thing on page 22.

368
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,800
Aristotle already knew that being couldn't be the supreme genus.

369
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:37,680
That is, the property that everything has insofar as it is, because being is used in all sorts of different ways.

370
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:45,039
And the being of numbers and the being of animals and the being of what else?

371
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:50,640
Made objects like briefcases is different.

372
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:57,360
And Aristotle saw that you couldn't say that they all had any common feature or property.

373
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,999
So he said being was being used analogically.

374
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:02,240
This is at the middle of 22.

375
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:13,880
The universality of being transcends any universality of genius, a genus, like genus and species, I did up from genus to species.

376
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:30,120
In medieval ontology, being as dedicated as the transcendens, Aristotle knew the unity of this transcendental universal as a unity of analogy in contrast to the multiplicity of the highest generic concepts available to things.

377
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:38,839
So it's not a big high concept like material thing or even broader maybe entity.

378
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:45,720
It's even, it doesn't, it's whatever it is, it can't do that job.

379
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,199
And that's what's happening on 22 there.

380
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,160
And he comes back to it on 26.

381
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,920
Oh, yeah, that's what I was looking for, where he spells it out, the middle.

382
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:05,319
Everything we talk about, everything we have in view, everything towards which we comport ourselves in any way is.

383
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,479
I think to say is being is sort of weird.

384
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:08,120
Is.

385
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,120
What we are, is, and so is how we are.

386
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:26,040
Being lies in the fact that something is, and in its being as it is, that is in reality, in presence of hand, in subsistence, that's what numbers do, in validity, in heide, in Dasein, in the there is.

387
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,800
And once you get that, you can.

388
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,920
And in which entity is the meaning of being to be discerned?

389
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,840
And the answer is there's no privileged entity from which you can get the meaning of being.

390
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:41,800
And so there goes that proposal.

391
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,520
And then comes the, but now, see, he's trying to get something right about each one of these wrong views.

392
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:52,119
What's right about the view that being is what all beings have in common?

393
00:37:52,119 --> 00:38:02,640
Well, what's right about it is that Aristotle says there is nothing, that being is not what all beings have in common.

394
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,959
So you've learned something.

395
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,400
You avoid that one.

396
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,640
That's all I think you can get out of that one.

397
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,560
The next one is being can't be defined.

398
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,479
Back to 23.

399
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,680
That's number two.

400
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:20,160
It has been maintained, secondly, that the concept of being is indefinable.

401
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:26,560
And what Heidegger wants to say about that is that just shows that being is not an entity.

402
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,959
He says that they're on to something.

403
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,279
The middle of that paragraph.

404
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,280
We can infer only that being cannot have the character of an entity.

405
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:48,320
Thus we cannot apply to being the concept of definition as presented in traditional logic, which itself has its foundation in ancient ontology and which within certain limits provides a justifiable way of characterizing entities.

406
00:38:48,320 --> 00:39:00,720
It's okay to talk about trying to apply being as a concept, but you can't because there's no way to define it.

407
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,360
And that shows it's not an entity.

408
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,320
That's fine.

409
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,800
And now comes the more interesting one, the one he gets a lot of mileage out of.

410
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,720
It's being is what is self-evident and taken for granted.

411
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,080
Thirdly, it is held that being is of all concepts the one that is self-evident.

412
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:25,039
And this is somehow both deeply wrong and got something right.

413
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:30,479
And what is it that it's got wrong and got right?

414
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:39,720
Well, what it's got wrong and right is that being is evident and obvious.

415
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:48,920
And the point is, I think one way to put the point is: remember that being is that which is nearest to us and yet farthest away.

416
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:58,120
So there's something, that being captures something about us that's very important, but it's not self-evident.

417
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:07,080
It's sort of structurally hidden from us what being is, even though we are it in some way.

418
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,920
And it's hidden not only structurally, but by way of falling.

419
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,120
I don't want to talk about falling because I don't like falling, and I put it off till next semester.

420
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:21,080
But the structural thing is important.

421
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:24,680
Being is like the lighting in the room.

422
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:32,519
Being has got to withdraw and not be obvious and evident for us to see and deal with beings.

423
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:34,920
That's the figure-ground idea again.

424
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,840
I mean, Heidegger jargon, nearest to us and farthest away.

425
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,880
That's because we're in it like a goldfish is in water.

426
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,479
It's everywhere.

427
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,720
We don't have any contrast class.

428
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,320
We don't have any concept.

429
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,840
We don't have any definition.

430
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:57,640
Heidegger thinks that's they're on the right track, but the question is, but they don't know what the right thing to say is.

431
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:04,840
And that's, but this is, it's an enigma what one should say.

432
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:07,959
About ten lines from the bottom.

433
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:15,720
But here we have an average kind of intelligibility which demonstrates that the being is unintelligible.

434
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,400
That's the negative side.

435
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:30,320
It makes manifest that in any way of reporting oneself toward entities as entities, even in any being towards entities as entities, there lies a priori an enigma.

436
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:39,520
The very fact that we already live in an understanding of being and that the meaning of being is veiled in darkness proves that it is necessary in principle to raise the question again.

437
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,519
So he uses this to say, well, we've got to start over.

438
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:44,799
We obviously haven't got it.

439
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,320
We haven't got it right yet.

440
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:55,360
And in a certain sense, we must trust common sense where we begin, that being is the most self-evident.

441
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,600
Because that's where you have to begin.

442
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,720
But on the other hand, you don't really want to trust common sense.

443
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:12,720
Because obviously it's got a covered-up view where everything is taken to be present at hand and where the background, which is necessarily structurally withdrawn and hidden, isn't taken account at all.

444
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:21,039
So if you start with common sense, you've got to also understand that common sense is a kind of cover-up of being.

445
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,760
And what are you going to do about that if you have to start with something that's wrong?

446
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,520
And you know it's wrong, but you have no other place to start.

447
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:42,240
Well, that's where he got into the state of mind of writing lots of stuff, which he cut down to a few sentences in being in time, about what's it, formal indication.

448
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:56,800
You start, when you do phenomenology, you have to start with where you are, but then you investigate more and more and bring in more and more phenomena and so forth till you get, till you discover that almost surely where you started was wrong.

449
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:04,080
In being in time, practically everything that he starts with turns out not to be what you normally thought it was.

450
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,360
Understanding was something intellectual, it seems like, and yet it turns out to be a totally unintellectual way of coping.

451
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:20,440
Truth, which looked like was correspondence, and now it turns out to be just the furthest thing from that, the background practices of disclosing.

452
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:29,560
You'll see next semester, guilt turns out to be, looks like it means you owe somebody something, but in fact, it doesn't mean anything like that at all.

453
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:40,760
And death looks like a kind of event at the end of your life, what John Hoagland calls croaking, but it turns out that it's nothing to do with what happens to you on your deathbed, and so forth.

454
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:58,120
So you're going to, the whole structure of Heidegger is to take these common sense everyday notions, because that's where you have to start, and do so much describing that you finally get, you see they're wrong and that they're covering up something else.

455
00:43:58,119 --> 00:43:59,959
So that's what's happening here.

456
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:06,360
So it is being is the most self-evident and it is the most veiled in darkness.

457
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,800
And Heidegger's got to have a method for getting it.

458
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,160
Now, you'll see next time, by the way, of course, you're going to read Introduction 2.

459
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:19,400
And Introduction 2 is going to define the phenomenological method.

460
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:35,640
And the phenomenological method is going to be another way of talking about how to deal with what is somehow structurally and other ways invisible and make it visible.

461
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:38,840
That's the job of phenomenology.

462
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,759
Okay, let's see where we are.

463
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,679
We live in it, we are it.

464
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,599
It's presupposed in all intentionality, in perception, in thought.

465
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:49,880
Did I read that already?

466
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,160
I think I did.

467
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:58,800
Yeah, it's always that we are directed toward entities, is already somehow depends on being.

468
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:09,280
And here he's saying that it turned it on 25, he says, you can't trust common sense.

469
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,360
So I'm trying to tell you both sides of this.

470
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,199
It isn't as if he's confused.

471
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,320
It's that the life is tough.

472
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:25,999
So at the end of the second full paragraph on 25, we do not even know the horizon in terms of which being is to be grasped and fixed.

473
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:29,519
But this vague average understanding of being is still a fact.

474
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,959
See, that's where you have to start.

475
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:32,880
That's the line I've been explaining.

476
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:44,720
Even though it's a cover-up, when something is covered up, he says somewhere, I think it's in the second introduction, that that's already at least a hint of what it really is.

477
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:56,320
If something is disguised and it's got a certain kind of disguise, that's already a place to start to figure out what it's hiding and why.

478
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,120
That's a Heidegger idea.

479
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:09,280
So on 25, you've got to start with where you are and the fact that you've got a vague average understanding of being.

480
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:24,560
And on 28, he will say at the top of 28, being arises from the average understanding of being in which we always operate, which in the end belongs to the essential constitution of Dasein.

481
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:26,319
So there's the other side of it.

482
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:29,359
Very bottom of 27, it really begins.

483
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:36,560
This guiding activity of taking a look at being, now that doesn't change it any.

484
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,479
So the tradition has always presupposed being.

485
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:59,079
And then he says at the bottom of 27, this presupposing of being has rather the character of taking a look at it beforehand so that in the light of it the entities presented to us get provisionally articulated in their being.

486
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:00,520
That's what he's going to do.

487
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:06,360
This guiding activity of taking a look at being arises from the average understanding and so forth.

488
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:16,280
So you've got to, and then at the end of the paragraph, in answering the question, the meaning of being, the issue is not one of grounding something by such a derivation.

489
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,120
That's the story again.

490
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:22,280
It's rather one of laying bare the ground.

491
00:47:22,999 --> 00:47:27,160
Laying bare the grounds for it and exhibiting them.

492
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:30,360
I pretty obscure.

493
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,880
I wonder how the translation is.

494
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,759
It is rather one of, I changed it in mine, and I don't know whether I did it from the translation or not.

495
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:49,399
It is rather one of laying bare, it says laying bare the grounds for it, that is the grounds for the question, the meaning of being, and exhibiting them.

496
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:58,600
And I say what we're doing is not one of grounding something by a derivation, but rather one of laying bare the ground.

497
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:01,959
And that all that other talk only makes it obscure.

498
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,840
Have you got it, Eugene?

499
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,360
You don't know where I am?

500
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:08,279
Oh, you don't have the German.

501
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:10,120
Do you have the German?

502
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:21,999
Okay, I'm now on page eight, the end of the first long paragraph, which begins on page 8.

503
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,360
Oh, it's in the footnote.

504
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,999
Hooray, let's look.

505
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:25,999
And what does it say in the footnote?

506
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,600
Well, I guess the English is pretty good.

507
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,400
So you're not trying to find a grounding for things.

508
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,519
There is no grounding.

509
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,479
Everything is ungrounded in Heidegger.

510
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:55,440
But we want to lay bare the grounds for the understanding, the meaning of being and exhibiting them.

511
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,159
That's pretty obscure.

512
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:57,360
Do you understand it in German?

513
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,359
I don't understand it in German or in English.

514
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,959
But that's fair game for the first introduction.

515
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,519
So just go on anyway.

516
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:07,519
That's the only way to go do it.

517
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:20,639
So now we're going to go through the way Heidegger distinguishes what is asked about and what the question is asked of and what it's asked for.

518
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,240
What is asked for.

519
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:34,400
Well, you can imagine already what is asked for is the meaning of being, but we've got to go through the first two: what is asked about and who you ask the question of or what.

520
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,360
It turns out to be who you ask the question of.

521
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,519
So on 25, it starts back.

522
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:45,440
We're always going over these same pages because they're all very, very condensed versions of this story.

523
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:57,999
So on 25, again, this time, again, it's about how, it's always about how this understanding of being is pervading everything we do.

524
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:08,440
It makes us and everything else possible and makes sense, and yet it's invisible and withdrawn and covered up and so forth.

525
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,479
So here we got it again.

526
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:18,680
At the second paragraph on 25, inquiry as a kind of seeking must be guided beforehand by what is sought.

527
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:22,840
So the meaning of being must already be available to us in some way.

528
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:28,039
As we have intimated, we have always conducted ourselves, our activities, in an understanding of being.

529
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:32,359
That's the common sense, we are it story, familiarity.

530
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:45,880
We've always been, if you read it my way, which works pretty well, so we've always had this familiarity in the background, like the light in the room, where we're not paying any attention to familiarity.

531
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:54,760
We're dealing with familiar things, but it's been there, and our activity has always been conducted in the light of this familiarity.

532
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:01,800
Out of this understanding arise both the explicit question of the meaning of being and the tendency that leads us toward its conception.

533
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:10,280
We do not know what being means, but even if we ask what is being, we keep within the understanding of the is, though we're unable to fix it conceptually.

534
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,720
We do not even know the horizon in terms of which that meaning is to be grasped.

535
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:22,680
That points ahead to Division II and to introduction to.

536
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:29,719
I just, you have to keep in mind that the horizon for understanding the meaning of being is temporality.

537
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,280
That's why the book is called Being in Time.

538
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:48,999
And that's what he's, and that's, at this stage when he's writing the introduction, we don't know the horizon, which is the background, on the basis of which, or in terms of which, we can understand what being is or understand being.

539
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:50,999
It's so confusing to say what being is.

540
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:57,679
But when we finally get to the end of Division II, you will see, although we never get to the end of Division II because he breaks off.

541
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:12,479
But when we get as far as the book gets, you will understand that the primordial temporality is that which will enable us to make sense of all modes of being.

542
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:24,320
You know, he's trying, if I'm right about this, and I haven't looked yet because I haven't thought about this since the last time I taught Division II, I hadn't come up with this idea yet.

543
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:42,079
If primordial temporality had better enable us to make sense of all the other modes of being, ready-to-hand, present-at-hand, subsistence, Dasein, and so forth, and it ought to be able to organize them so that you can tell which ones follow from which.

544
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:52,640
It's going to give you a genealogy of them, and it also has to explain the unity of them, why they always have this threefold structure that keeps coming up.

545
00:52:53,200 --> 00:53:05,840
If it does all that, if primordial temporality, which you don't even know what it is yet, but if you, but when you find out, it's got to do all those jobs, if it's going to do the job it's supposed to do, give you the meaning of being.

546
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:20,240
That is, give you the structure that makes this whole makes being something that you can understand and can make sense of.

547
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,880
Okay, that's just jumping ahead.

548
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,560
Let's go back to where we are.

549
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,759
Anybody want to say anything?

550
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,080
I have a feeling I've talked for too long.

551
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:32,079
Nobody wants to say anything.

552
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,319
You look like you might want to say something.

553
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,239
No, you just want to scratch your head.

554
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,440
Okay, then let's go on.

555
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:42,679
So we need what we and then we know the phenomenon.

556
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:44,920
Okay, where we're at that now.

557
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,759
I'm going to try something.

558
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,880
I wrote something here and then I bracketed it because I decided not to say it.

559
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,160
But since we've got time, I think I'll try it and see what happens.

560
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:05,400
Beings are intelligible.

561
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:24,280
But intelligent, remember I said I would explain why I was wrong when I used to think that intelligibility was the most general thing you could say about everything, and that therefore it was, in effect, I was treating intelligibility as beingness.

562
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,640
That every entity is intelligible in its own way.

563
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,759
Math entities and animal entities and people entities and desks and so forth.

564
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,360
They're all intelligible.

565
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:43,719
So why isn't that a property of everything such that, but if it is, then I've discovered beingness.

566
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,720
So there must be something wrong with that.

567
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,759
Well, that's right.

568
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,039
There's something wrong with it.

569
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:51,400
Intelligible isn't an ordinary property.

570
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,320
It's holistic.

571
00:54:53,639 --> 00:55:03,560
It isn't as if sort of everything has the property by itself of being intelligible, the way green things have the property of being green or being heavy.

572
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:10,760
Things are only intelligible in a total holistic thing, like the referential totality, in which hammers are intelligible.

573
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,640
Intelligibility isn't a property of hammers.

574
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:15,719
Weight is a property of hammers.

575
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,840
And so forth.

576
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,880
So I thought, so then I thought, good.

577
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:26,560
So intelligibility isn't like beingness, but it's still, then it's even better the right thing to say.

578
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,360
Well, I think, now I think that's not right either.

579
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:43,360
The trouble with intelligibility is that it seems you want to sort of ask what's behind intelligibility?

580
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,999
What is it on the basis of which things are intelligible?

581
00:55:45,999 --> 00:55:51,040
Because being ought to be, you keep getting this further and further back, more abstract.

582
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,640
I think familiarity is more basic than intelligibility.

583
00:55:54,639 --> 00:56:04,240
I think things in a room are intelligible because we have a familiarity with rooms, and only insofar as we have a familiarity with rooms.

584
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:15,199
So for me, and familiarity is certainly not a property, because things can have it and lose it, and we can gain it more by coping with things more.

585
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:17,920
I wrote down something about that later.

586
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,040
I want to go back and look at my last note because I was writing about familiarity.

587
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:27,199
I can't remember even whether I was being for or against it.

588
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,759
I was torn about it.

589
00:56:44,959 --> 00:56:47,279
I think I'm for familiarity for the time being.

590
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:49,999
I don't, I think, let me go on and see.

591
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,519
Oh, I wanted to, let's go back to where I was.

592
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:57,920
Are any of you reading Taylor Carmen on this business about being?

593
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,479
Well, then I don't have to tell you, I think he's wrong, but I'll tell you, just in case you ever do read him.

594
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:07,959
He thinks that Heidegger's interested in the is of predication and the is of existence.

595
00:57:07,959 --> 00:57:12,520
That is, this is brown, and this lectern just is.

596
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,400
It exists.

597
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,319
And Heidegger's interested in them.

598
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,320
He's written about them and so forth.

599
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,360
But it's not as if he's going to find out what is getting at.

600
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:27,240
He's not going to get at being by thinking about predication and existence.

601
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,519
And he doesn't.

602
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:41,160
He definitely wants to get at something because the tradition has gotten talked about a lot about that.

603
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:52,999
And okay, so what did I say about that?

604
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,240
I thought I had a page number for that, but I guess I don't.

605
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:12,520
But it's clear that Heidegger, I mean, I guess I just repeat, Heidegger doesn't think that being has to do either with predication or existence, if being is that on the basis of which being is understood.

606
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:21,880
The background and familiarity isn't a property you predicate of something, and it isn't about the existence of something.

607
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:32,839
So whatever, so you can use being as being as a copula has to do with properties and it has to do with existence, but it's not what Heidegger's interested in.

608
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,279
It's just a special case.

609
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,280
Things show up, and then they have properties, and then they either exist or they don't exist.

610
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,559
But how do they show up at all?

611
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,719
We're back to that again.

612
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:45,720
How come they're intelligible?

613
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,640
And that's what he's interested in.

614
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:50,479
So I think Taylor doesn't get it right.

615
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,279
Yeah.

616
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,400
What do you think that the driver is doing?

617
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,639
That's what I was looking for in here and couldn't find.

618
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,240
I swore I wrote it down.

619
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:06,880
I have to reconstruct it.

620
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,159
Put it on hold.

621
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:14,320
I think if I just keep going, I will get to a point in which I try to distinguish familiarity from intelligibility.

622
00:59:17,999 --> 00:59:18,799
Just a second.

623
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,080
I doubt if I can.

624
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:20,959
Let's see.

625
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,160
Ah, yeah, maybe it's this.

626
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:33,440
I think that entities are intelligible.

627
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,319
But I think that, yeah, now I remember.

628
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,799
I wanted to say rooms aren't intelligible.

629
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,679
Now I got it back.

630
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,319
I think my computer dropped it.

631
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:53,440
Somehow, rooms, when rooms are familiar, that seems to be more basic than whatever it is that entities or entities are intelligible, I think.

632
00:59:53,440 --> 01:00:03,440
But what we're looking for is always not entities or even properties of entities or even holistic properties of entities.

633
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,200
I remember what I said now.

634
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:14,800
Because there's something different, something less intellectual, something less aimed at entities, and that's what familiarity has in it.

635
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,479
So it's a better way to think about it.

636
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:23,999
And I give up my view that you should equate being with intelligibility.

637
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:36,479
The nearest thing I ever come to is always t saying the understanding of being is familiarity, and that's and that's that's at least closer to what's behind it all.

638
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:43,320
Remember, you want to uh here's I'll try this.

639
01:00:43,479 --> 01:00:50,920
I haven't just offered if being is that on the basis of which beings are understood, then being can't be intelligibility.

640
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:56,360
Intelligibility is what beings have got when they are understood, and we're looking for something behind it.

641
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,959
That's good, that's helpful.

642
01:00:57,959 --> 01:01:00,199
I if it's not down here, it should be.

643
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,040
Uh yeah, Tyler.

644
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,800
Which is more primordial?

645
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,679
Oh, like familiarity and intelligibility equiprimordial.

646
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:14,040
Let me think about that.

647
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:23,880
That's right.

648
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:28,440
I was trying to say something like that, only spin it the other way.

649
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,719
It seems to me there may be an order of priority.

650
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:37,720
There's certainly you can't have familiarity without intelligibility or intelligibility without familiarity.

651
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:45,959
But if you just again try to stick to common sense, it looks like it's the familiarity is more basic than the intelligibility.

652
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:53,479
It's where because you can find your way around in the world or in the room, particular entities become intelligible.

653
01:01:53,479 --> 01:02:07,400
And it seems to me that this finding your way around is the is what makes intelligibility possible, which makes it possible for things to show up as intelligible.

654
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,999
But I agree with you that it's they're very, very close.

655
01:02:10,999 --> 01:02:20,280
You couldn't you can't have a familiar room in which nothing is intelligible, and you couldn't have an intelligib intelligibility in a room in which nothing was familiar.

656
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,559
I'm ready to make them, well, I'm almost ready to make them equal.

657
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:31,760
I don't know how to describe, and therefore I don't know what to do, what I sense as the priority of familiarity.

658
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:35,600
Yeah, you both get a help here or hinder or whatever.

659
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,160
Knowledgeable brands, but without any kind of familiar concept.

660
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,640
I see, like a clock that's oozing over and so on.

661
01:02:50,479 --> 01:03:04,159
Yeah, I sort of think things could be intelligible even in an unfamiliar setting, whereas anyway, go ahead, Curtis.

662
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:04,880
I don't know.

663
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,640
Yes?

664
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,959
I think about familiarity is kind of like built into the perfect.

665
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:19,440
Good.

666
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,479
That's helpful.

667
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:21,760
I think that's interesting.

668
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,920
I mean, but that's both like what Tyler is saying and not, and that's why it's interesting.

669
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:34,720
Because since being in the world is such a together notion, it's no wonder they're equiprimordial.

670
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:45,839
But when Heidegger has a choice, I think, of what's more equiprimordial than what, if you want to say it, funny way, then I think it's supposed to be the world.

671
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:52,880
I mean, it's just one more move beyond having a subject that, and that's what you want to say too, isn't it?

672
01:03:53,200 --> 01:04:04,160
That we make things intelligible to us, but we do it on the background of, on the basis of, on the basis of having a world.

673
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,840
I guess I want to say, yeah, intelligibility can't be a basis.

674
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:12,440
We want to know what is the basis of things being intelligible.

675
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,840
And then I want to say, well, that's on the background of a world.

676
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,599
Of course, and then Tyler comes in and rightly says, we are being in the world.

677
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:21,799
You can't separate them.

678
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,520
They are totally equiprimordial.

679
01:04:24,519 --> 01:04:30,359
And I want to say, yeah, but nonetheless, I think Heidegger has some sense that the world is the most basic.

680
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:30,840
Yeah.

681
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,680
Yeah.

682
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:35,399
Yeah.

683
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:40,600
Well, but back to being.

684
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:44,839
That on the basis of which beings are already understood.

685
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,640
Ah, why don't I just take my favorite sentence?

686
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:53,640
Because if that says, what is it on the basis of which beings are intelligible?

687
01:04:53,959 --> 01:04:58,999
And that says that you've got to find something on the basis of which beings are understood.

688
01:04:58,999 --> 01:05:02,440
Chairs are intelligible and doors make sense and all that.

689
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:14,280
And if you ask yourself, well, on the basis of what are things intelligible, there's only one answer that I can come up with the phenomenon for, and that's familiarity.

690
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:30,039
So then that on the basis of which things are intelligible, that on the basis of which things were already understood, is our ability to get around in and cope with everything in the world, or whatever we can.

691
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,479
I like that.

692
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,680
I don't know.

693
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,319
I'm going to stop with that.

694
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:39,880
I feel that that's getting it the way Heidegger wants it.

695
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,799
Now, let me see where we are.

696
01:05:47,479 --> 01:05:59,519
Okay, we get to my conclusion here, where I'm going to try to sum up what we've just been saying and go on to the next move, which is the move to Dasein, which also is in Division I.

697
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,119
So, let's go on.

698
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:07,199
Okay, being, I mean, I'm saying this over and over, partly to see if I can get it clear in my own head.

699
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,959
Being is the background that makes all beings show up as intelligible.

700
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:16,880
The background withdraws like the light in the room.

701
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:24,160
We notice and have a language only for talking about what shows up as figure on the background.

702
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:28,880
And that's why we end up talking about substances with properties.

703
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:38,320
So, Heidegger holds that we're socialized into the background by being given a basic know-how, which is our ability to find our way around in the world.

704
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,760
And that's familiarity, and that's the bottom line.

705
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,719
Now, I gave a new reference on 35.

706
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,799
Is there something exciting on 35?

707
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,920
Let's see.

708
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:56,880
Now, could I?

709
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,640
Oh, I'm on 34 there.

710
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,679
Oh, yeah, I don't know.

711
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:05,440
I thought that helped a little with the very last line of the introduction.

712
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:16,160
The question of being is nothing other than the radicalization of an essential tendency of being, which belongs to Dasein itself, the pre-ontological understanding of being.

713
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:25,280
I mean, I guess I, what I want, what I want to say about that is we're always trying to make sense of things, and we always do it on a background.

714
01:07:26,879 --> 01:07:43,559
And when we ask the question of the meaning of being, we're pushing ourselves to ask the question about the background, which is already there in our pre-ontological understanding.

715
01:07:46,360 --> 01:08:00,039
It's as if Heidegger's saying, if you want to raise the question of being, you have to take the familiarity, which you've already got, which is always in the background, like the light in the room, and talk about it.

716
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,559
Then you're doing ontology.

717
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:02,999
I think that's what that sentence says.

718
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:17,159
The question of being is nothing other, that is asking the Heidegger question, the ontology question, is nothing other than the radicalization of an essential tendency of the being, which belongs to Dasein, the pre-ontological understanding of being.

719
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,519
So I'm saying it again.

720
01:08:18,519 --> 01:08:21,639
You've got a pre-ontological understanding of familiarity.

721
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,320
What is it to radicalize it?

722
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:31,479
It's to try to understand this background understanding of familiarity, what it is, what its structure is, how it works.

723
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:33,639
That's what the book is going to do.

724
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:34,200
Okay.

725
01:08:34,519 --> 01:08:40,839
Questions, as I said, this is going to be so abstract, and you've got all these things which seem to say the same thing.

726
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,679
Maybe it's my fault.

727
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:47,320
I've only got one sort of clue, so I keep saying it over and over.

728
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:49,159
Where are we now?

729
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,719
I'm saying again this over and over in my notes.

730
01:08:53,719 --> 01:09:03,320
We perceive on the base of the background that the background doesn't what we notice, and we don't have any vocabulary for talking about it, so the tradition has passed it over.

731
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:08,360
But Heidegger says that the oh, yeah, now what?

732
01:09:08,919 --> 01:09:09,639
A new problem.

733
01:09:09,639 --> 01:09:16,039
Heidegger in 26 says that being is the being of entities.

734
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,959
That sort of threw me.

735
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,400
I mean, if that were right, then it would sound like intelligibility.

736
01:09:20,919 --> 01:09:26,320
You might say, well, being is the intelligibility of entities.

737
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:30,959
But I suppose you could say, I don't think you can say familiarity of entities.

738
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,559
So what's he doing when he says that?

739
01:09:32,559 --> 01:09:33,759
Let's look at it.

740
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,159
I'm not sure I understand it.

741
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:48,719
That first paragraph 126: insofar as being constitutes what is asked about, and being means the being of entities, then entities themselves turn out to be what is interrogated.

742
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:56,639
We ask about entities to find out about being.

743
01:09:57,599 --> 01:10:00,159
I suppose that's right.

744
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,559
We ask about hammering and so forth.

745
01:10:02,559 --> 01:10:12,159
We ask about all sorts of familiar stuff in order finally to get to the referential totality, and finally we end up with familiarity.

746
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,079
So we start with the being of beings.

747
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,839
But that which is asked about being means the being of beings.

748
01:10:19,839 --> 01:10:25,440
What can that being means the being of beings?

749
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:35,519
Well, I think the long way to hear that is being means some general property of beings, like beingness, like intelligibility, like familiarity.

750
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,199
That can't be right.

751
01:10:37,599 --> 01:10:42,719
Although familiarity is getting close to it, maybe that is right.

752
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,679
But I want to say, I had another way of putting it.

753
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,120
So let me look at this for a second.

754
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:47,919
Dave, yeah.

755
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,119
Does he say that?

756
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,679
Yeah.

757
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,639
Okay, good.

758
01:11:00,639 --> 01:11:01,360
Well, I like that.

759
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,639
Where is that again?

760
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,200
I see, I see.

761
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,360
And being means, okay, I think that's what I did.

762
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:14,039
But I wrote that is intelligibility because that was my previous, that was last year.

763
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,879
Yeah, now I think it's the familiarity of it.

764
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,239
I think that's right.

765
01:11:19,799 --> 01:11:21,479
Now let's see what I wrote here.

766
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,919
Beingness is a general property.

767
01:11:26,919 --> 01:11:35,400
Because beingness is a general property, familiarity can't be a general property.

768
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,599
And that's when I wrote down the familiarity of the world.

769
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:47,879
And familiarity has this characteristic that Aristotle noticed about being, namely that different sorts of things have their own different sorts of being.

770
01:11:47,879 --> 01:11:53,879
So we've got the familiarity of the world, of rooms, of chairs, of other dosins.

771
01:11:53,879 --> 01:11:56,360
That's not some genus that they all have.

772
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:00,839
They're all species under the genus familiarity.

773
01:12:00,839 --> 01:12:09,159
That's something they all have, however, and they have it in some analogical way, I suppose, like being.

774
01:12:09,879 --> 01:12:11,479
I knew I'd written it down somewhere.

775
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:31,079
Being is always the being of beings means not that being is some kind of general predicate beingness, or not even a general characteristic like intelligibility, that being as the background familiarity that makes intelligible is, quote, only if there are entities that are being made intelligible.

776
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:43,079
And that's what I think, if you want to talk more about being as the being of entities, then that means there have to be entities that are familiar and are intelligible.

777
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:48,679
But then I tried, how about this very general formal way of talking about it?

778
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:52,199
The background is always the background of some foreground.

779
01:12:52,879 --> 01:13:12,320
So that's a way of saying being is always the being of entities, namely being as the background familiarity is always the background for particular things to be in the foreground to be familiar.

780
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,240
Again, I'm saying the same thing over and over.

781
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:20,079
It drives me crazy, but I don't know what else to say except the one phenomenon that I see.

782
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,679
So let me go on.

783
01:13:23,919 --> 01:13:29,039
Being is the background familiarity that opens the world and guides every way of dealing with entities.

784
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,759
It's very closely related to disclosedness that way.

785
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:41,679
And it turns out that we better understand more about being and familiarity.

786
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:46,559
We should switch to thinking about disclosing and disclosedness.

787
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:51,519
He makes that move by saying, and what entity are we going to ask about?

788
01:13:51,519 --> 01:13:53,679
Well, let's ask about Dasein.

789
01:13:53,679 --> 01:14:02,879
And now that you know where we end up at the end with truth and disclosiveness, it turns out that it's Dasein that does the disclosing.

790
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:08,479
So he shifts in the introduction to the question, I take it that's how it goes.

791
01:14:08,879 --> 01:14:19,039
It's disclosedness is a good name for the way the background is the background for some foreground that lets things show up.

792
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,679
And now Dasein does the disclosing.

793
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:22,719
So let's go to that.

794
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,320
We just have time.

795
01:14:25,839 --> 01:14:30,239
So, what entity should we ask when we want to know about being?

796
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:41,400
We should begin with Dasein, he says on 27, to work out the question at the very top, of being adequately, we must make an entity, the inquirer, transparent in his own being.

797
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:52,039
And so, then, skipping a little, this entity with each of us is himself, and which includes inquiring as one of its possibilities of its being, we're going to call Dasein.

798
01:14:52,360 --> 01:15:03,719
That's the first time he defines Dasein, and we skipped it, but we got it back on page 68 or whatever, 67, where he redefines Dasein.

799
01:15:04,759 --> 01:15:08,280
It turns out that this is not, that's a very fast move.

800
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:17,799
In my commentary, I go on and on fussing about that, why he thinks that Dasein should be the privileged thing to think about.

801
01:15:17,799 --> 01:15:28,519
Why not look at artworks, which he did later, or nature, which he also did later, or things in the world of the primitives, which he also did later, ritual kind of things.

802
01:15:28,519 --> 01:15:34,919
So, but right now, he's thinking that that's where he should look.

803
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:43,799
But he writes a footnote at this point from later Heidegger, that the meaning of being is not drawn from this being, Dasein.

804
01:15:43,799 --> 01:15:49,079
That is, that's where he gets clearer and clearer that the world is even more basic.

805
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:59,079
But now, he, and now I'm just sort of saying scattered things for a minute that are important and interesting.

806
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,839
I would just got to call your attention to things in the introduction that I like.

807
01:16:02,839 --> 01:16:09,719
See, I don't have to really talk about Dasein, because we talked a lot about Dasein in the first week of the course, and there's nothing new in here.

808
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:17,639
But I want you to notice, because some of the you may want to say this to somebody, how Kuhnian Heidegger is when he thinks about science.

809
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,440
And he just throws this in, so I'll just throw it in, the third paragraph on 29.

810
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:30,239
The real movement of the sciences takes place when their basic concepts undergo a more or less radical revision.

811
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:36,719
Read scientific revolution in Kuhn, which is transparent to itself.

812
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:42,879
The level which a science has reached is determined by how far it is capable of a crisis in its basic concepts.

813
01:16:42,879 --> 01:17:03,440
Do you see how amazingly Kuhnian, I mean, whereas you might think, and everybody did think before Kuhn, except for Heidegger, that the main thing, the more developed a science was, the less it was going to suddenly discover that everything it was saying was wrong, the way Newton was suddenly discovered by Einstein to be wrong.

814
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,919
And people were worrying and worrying about how to fix it.

815
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:13,119
The positivists thought they could make science so that it was so solid that it wouldn't ever have to go through this kind of crisis and break down again.

816
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:21,039
And the operationalists, when I was a graduate student, were trying to define the entities in science so we wouldn't ever have to redefine them.

817
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:29,280
But Heidegger's got this great idea that science really progresses when there is this radical kind of breakdown.

818
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,280
And you've got to be, and not every science can have a breakdown.

819
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:39,999
Science has got to be normal science to talk like Kuhn if it's going to be able to have breakdowns.

820
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:48,639
I mean, it can't have breakdowns in psychology and sociology because nobody agrees with what the basic principles are that could break down.

821
01:17:48,639 --> 01:18:05,440
But science got itself into this view in which, say, physics has a total view of how the universe works, and that total view can give rise to anomalies, and then it could be turned out to be wrong, and then we really learn something.

822
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,039
Heidegger sees that, which is pretty amazing.

823
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,919
That's because he was a science major once upon a time.

824
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:24,200
And the other thing that he sees that's interesting here, I want to just give it, is, oh, yeah, the other thing I want you to see is on 31, I mentioned it already, that he wants, what he's going to do in being and time.

825
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,999
Well, one of the things he's going to do is a genealogy of the different ways of being.

826
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,079
This is the middle of page 31.

827
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:36,440
So he's going to do what Aristotle couldn't do, show how all these ways of being fit together.

828
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:49,320
He says it remains naive and opaque if it, that is, ontology, in its researches into the being of entities, fails to discuss the meaning of being in general, Aristotle's question.

829
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:54,679
And the ontological task of a genealogy of the different possible ways of being.

830
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:07,079
And that's, you notice he's doing it in front of you when he shows how the ready-to-hand derived, sorry, the present at hand is derived from the ready-to-hand by two steps.

831
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:11,799
First, you get some breakdown and you get the unready-to-hand, which is still situational.

832
01:19:11,799 --> 01:19:15,400
But then you deworld or de-situate and you get the present at hand.

833
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:20,280
And maybe you do something else even and put it in a new theoretical construct.

834
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:25,959
And then you get physics, which I think is where he calls its way of being as reality, and so forth.

835
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:32,519
So Heidegger's got this interesting idea, which I think is important to somebody people to follow up.

836
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:34,519
You should do a genealogy of being.

837
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:35,240
Now, let me see.

838
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,280
And if you do, I wrote down here, why is that important?

839
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:45,719
Because then you'll see the limitations of cognitivism, which thinks it can start with the present at hand and just build things from there.

840
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:55,280
If you understand how the present of hand is a privative form genealogically descended from the ready-to-hand, you won't think then, well, okay, I'm finished.

841
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,639
I didn't get to Dasein.

842
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:59,280
There's nothing important there that we haven't got already.

843
01:19:59,599 --> 01:20:07,759
I do want to make you, I just want to call your attention to, real fast, that he defines existential and existenciale on page 33.

844
01:20:07,759 --> 01:20:14,959
I felt bad because it doesn't ever get defined in the part I assigned you because it's already been defined there.

845
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,119
So go back and fix your head by looking at page 33.

846
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,719
Okay, next time, division, introduction two.
