1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,159
So I wanted to mention significance, which we sort of skipped over, and then go on from there.

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,759
So let's start with 120, 8 and 9.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:27,479
Significance is really just another name for things we've been talking about already, but you've got to, there's so many characters now, and so many names for each one, like a Russian novel, you've got to keep track of what's going on.

4
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:33,079
So, significance, I take it on 120, but I'll give you my version.

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:01:21,720
I think what happens is when you get the relational totality of equipment, the relational whole of equipment, and connect it with the for the sake of which, so that you now have, you now know, so to speak, the point of having and using this equipment, because it all goes back to Dasein's identity and its stand on its own being, then you've got the referential totality in its significance for each particular person and for the whole culture, and at a level of abstraction, Heidegger just wants to talk about its, not its specific significance, that's always to existential, that there is significance, that the referential totality always plugs in to for the sake of which.

6
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:30,519
This is what's going on on 120, where I'll just read crucial hard stuff.

7
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:38,119
The for the sake of which, and this is the kind of review I'm reading this because it's a sentence that sums up, and I believe I read it last time too, but I'm not sure.

8
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:49,960
The for the sake of which signifies in an order to this in turn towards this, and the latter an in-which of letting something be involved, and that in turn, the with-which of an involvement.

9
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,839
Sum up of this, that's the structure of worldhood from what we were talking about on Tuesday.

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,280
Now, he says, these relationships are bound up with one another as a primordial whole.

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:12,000
They are what they are as this signifying, in which Dasein gives itself beforehand, its being in the world, as something to be understood.

12
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,639
So now it's getting set up with the signifying for Dasein.

13
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,360
Now, so we've got all that already in talking about the piece of chalk.

14
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:28,000
I won't do it again, as I did on the board.

15
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,120
But I do want to say two more things about significance.

16
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:53,679
It seems to me, yeah, that I, yeah, but all I want to say now, right now, is say something, one more thing about the for the sake of which, which you have to plug in at the end of the referential whole to get significance.

17
00:02:53,679 --> 00:03:05,280
I discovered in office hours that it's kind of misleading to talk about it being a role like a teacher that I have grown up in.

18
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
You can either grow up in it or assign yourself to it.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,319
Sometimes lots of people never have to grow up in one, and lots of people don't have their, don't find their identity for a while and then choose it.

20
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:25,119
And some, I think rarely, people just change their identity and stop, say, being a teacher and start being a politician or something like that.

21
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,720
That can happen too.

22
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:36,240
But the main thing is, it's misleading to use the term your role and goal to talk about the for the sake of.

23
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,280
I did for years.

24
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,479
I thought, oh boy, Heidegger uses that terrible terminology.

25
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,040
Why doesn't he, why are you always making up these words?

26
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,359
Why doesn't he just use ordinary words?

27
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:51,200
The answer is usually because they're misleading, because they're corrupted by the tradition.

28
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,520
It's very good exercise in reading Heidegger to try to find ordinary words.

29
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
I haven't said this already, have I?

30
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,239
You're having heard this already.

31
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,280
Well, okay.

32
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:10,679
It's very good practice in reading Heidegger to do what I can't help doing, trying to find good old common sense words for what he's talking about.

33
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:23,960
But if you can't, and then use them, like role and goal, and then you gradually discover why they don't work, and you end up having to use his own weird, clunky terminology after all, the for the sake of which.

34
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,720
And that's what happens here.

35
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,960
Sometimes it's the opposite, by the way.

36
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,400
I love what we're going to talk about today, familiarity.

37
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,840
That's a good old term in German for Trautheit.

38
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,720
It's all over the place.

39
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,960
It's not a fancy Heidegger jargon, but it's exactly what he wants to talk about.

40
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,920
But not so much to the, I mean, the for the sake of which.

41
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,119
What is that?

42
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:46,999
Well, why not call it a role and a goal?

43
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:54,040
Well, because a role is something with which you're not identified, with which you can put down.

44
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:06,440
You can, you know, play the role of the smartest student in the class or something like that, and then you can get tired of that role and start playing the role of the most helpful student in the class or something like that.

45
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,040
Roles are, and roles are like in plays.

46
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,319
I mean, you can, you've got different roles in every play.

47
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,160
So what's for the sake of which is your identity.

48
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,919
And you can't give it up.

49
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:26,119
You can't even, I think when it's working at its normalist best, you can't even step outside and see what it is.

50
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,359
Like the sacrificial mother doesn't say that, doesn't see that that's her identity.

51
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:36,999
What she sees is that every time she wants to do anything, turns out she ends up doing something for the kids instead.

52
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:44,080
So it's much closer and more existential than a role.

53
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,919
And why not a goal?

54
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,840
Well, I talked about that last time.

55
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,160
You can have a goal of being a professor and of getting tenure, but you can't have a goal of being a teacher.

56
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
Because a goal is something in the future that you can realize.

57
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:07,040
Whereas being a teacher or a father or whatever is a job that you've got for the rest of your life, unless something very strange happens.

58
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,080
And it's not in front of you as something you will achieve, but it's sort of in front of you in a different way.

59
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,999
It's constantly organizing what you're doing.

60
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,840
Okay, that shouldn't be hard, but I just have to say it.

61
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:28,559
Now, we've seen that, we've got all that.

62
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:46,879
So now I just want to say that why adding significance is interesting and important is that significance is Heidegger's move to get you to the background or familiarity, which is his word.

63
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,799
Sometimes the background is the upon which.

64
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:56,320
And if you want to fill out the upon which, well, the upon what?

65
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,760
Well, familiarity.

66
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,200
But that's going to take the rest of the day to talk about.

67
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,679
But I want to read the place where this happens at the bottom of 120.

68
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,040
Then we'll get on to the way he deals with it.

69
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,800
He says, the relational, well, German, we're in 87.

70
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:23,040
The relational total, where there's a lot of italics, the relational totality, that is the relational whole of this signifying, we call significance.

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:31,400
This is what makes up the structure of the world, the structure of that wherein Dasein, as such, already is.

72
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Dasein, and now comes the new term, in its familiarity with significance, is the ontical condition for the possibility of discovering entities which are encountered in a world with involvement, namely readiness to hand, as their kind of being, and which can thus make themselves known as they are in themselves.

73
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,200
I think I read that last time, didn't I?

74
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,240
No, okay.

75
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm having this Beijah view thing because I've just been reading it over the last few days.

76
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,280
Okay, well, there's a lot packed into that, isn't there?

77
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,080
So, we did the structure of the world.

78
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,079
Now we're going to talk about familiarity.

79
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,720
What I need to explain is why Dasein is the ontical condition.

80
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,880
Does that surprise you?

81
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,360
Well, that's because Dasein is an entity.

82
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:22,439
An ontical is an entity.

83
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,720
It happens to be a very, very peculiar entity.

84
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:34,840
It's ontico-ontological because it's the entity which makes every way of being, including its own way of being, an issue for it.

85
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:35,959
But it's an entity.

86
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,640
So that makes it the ontical condition for the possibility.

87
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,480
And now comes another important technical term, discovering entities.

88
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, what does this entity, namely Dasein, have to do with other entities?

89
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,439
Well, one thing it has to do with them, lots of the time, is what Heidegger calls discovery.

90
00:08:54,439 --> 00:09:04,280
That means coming across them and using them or fixing them or staring at them and studying their properties.

91
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,040
You can do all sorts of things under the term discovering.

92
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,760
The opposite of discovering, however, might sound like it ought to cover everything.

93
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:19,360
What's the opposite of discovering or what do you want to distinguish from discovering?

94
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,960
Well, you want to distinguish from discovering disclosing.

95
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,400
And that's crucial because disclosing is really the fancy thing that Heidegger's interested in.

96
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:46,320
That is, what you do when you disclose, and we'll hear more about this, is open up a world in which you can then discover particular entities with particular functions and so forth.

97
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,999
And Heidegger's, he wants to note that there is discovering, but everybody's always known it.

98
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,280
And it isn't going to be a big deal for him.

99
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,319
But what's a big deal for him is disclosing.

100
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:08,400
And that's the way that Dasein makes it possible that entities can show up and be discovered.

101
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,200
So now we have to talk about that a lot.

102
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:20,640
And it turns out that disclosing is made possible by familiarity.

103
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
That's why familiarity is so important.

104
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:31,760
I brought along Blattner's book because it just struck me that he, I mean, for one thing, most people don't even know how important familiarity is.

105
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,840
And it took me, I mean, I know that it's not easy to know it because it took me, I don't know, 20 years to notice it.

106
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:48,960
Whereas most of these terms get defined and then used over and over and over, familiarity comes up all the time, but he never makes a big deal out of it.

107
00:10:50,079 --> 00:11:07,640
It just seems something that it starts right where I was reading, and he mentions familiarity a lot in the part I'm going to read you, but he talks about so many other things too that the sort of rock-bottom importance of familiarity doesn't get thematized.

108
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,679
It does more in his lectures, and I'll be reading you bits from basic problems.

109
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:22,360
But Blattner has a nice, as usual, down-to-earth, clear sense of how important it is on page 12.

110
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,880
Heidegger offers an alternative description of experience.

111
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,120
He argues that our fundamental experience of the world is one of familiarity.

112
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,079
See, I don't think any place does Heidegger just say it.

113
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,600
It's all over the place.

114
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:37,800
But it would be nice if somebody said it, and Bill says it.

115
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:47,160
He says, We do not normally experience ourselves as subjects standing over against an object, but rather at home in the world we already understand.

116
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,040
We act in a world in which we are immersed.

117
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:57,240
We are not just absorbed in the world, but our sense of identity of who we are cannot be disentangled from the world around us.

118
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,040
We are what matters to us in our living.

119
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,120
We are implicated in the world.

120
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:09,720
The bulk of Division I of Being in Time is devoted to spelling out the phenomenology of this familiarity.

121
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,720
You can see why I might want to read it.

122
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:14,440
I mean, every sentence is totally clear.

123
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:16,679
Every sentence is absolutely right.

124
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:26,919
I didn't go and look at all the other introductory books on being in time that I put on your recommended reading list with this question in mind.

125
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:37,000
So I don't know how much, say, Holt or Rathal or Guignon and all these other people pay attention to familiarity.

126
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:50,880
It'd be interesting to know if anybody sees that there, if anybody comes to the conclusion that they don't even know it's that the X doesn't know it's important in their commentary, let me know and I'll scratch them from the list for the next round.

127
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,119
And if you discover somebody who thinks clearly like Latin or how important they are, that's it.

128
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,760
Then I'll give them special support too.

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,440
Anyway, it is clearly very important.

130
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:14,720
And it's going to get us to something which, again, it took ages to occur to me what's going on in all this dense stuff.

131
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:18,319
But on 119, he makes an absolutely crucial move.

132
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,080
He makes it in italics.

133
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,439
So it isn't his fault.

134
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,919
It was just mock density that I didn't see it.

135
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:38,160
But so much is going on that not only is he interested in the structure of worldhood, which is what we've done up to now, but now we're getting a new issue, the phenomenon of worldhood.

136
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,679
Now you may think, well, that's not a big deal.

137
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,120
You can call it either one.

138
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,640
But it's a very big deal.

139
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:52,320
The structure of worldhood is this abstract structure of the inorder to's and towards witches and for the sake of witches.

140
00:13:52,319 --> 00:14:00,240
The phenomenon of world is what it is to experience the world as a world.

141
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,520
And the phenomenon of world is really familiarity.

142
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,840
That's how it fits together.

143
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,040
And it turns out that it's really the phenomenon of world that's more important than the structure of world.

144
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,640
It's as if somehow the structure of world is just a great big tour de force which he brings off just to show somebody like Wittgenstein that he can do it.

145
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,480
But the phenomenon of world plays a crucial role.

146
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,799
Yeah.

147
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,320
Oh, this, well, I see, I guess I see.

148
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:33,799
Let me see.

149
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,480
If I don't answer you, say it again.

150
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,760
What he wants to know is sort of why I sort of separating the structure from the phenomena, right?

151
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:46,919
Structure development thing.

152
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,480
Why do you find any other question?

153
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,320
Oh, good.

154
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:04,839
No, there isn't any other way to think about how the structure discloses itself to the phenomenologist except by way of familiarity.

155
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,960
But the structure is not itself this experience of familiarity.

156
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,320
It's a structure.

157
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:13,960
And now you want to ask, it's not a big deal.

158
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,800
Now you want to ask structure of what?

159
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:20,440
Well, it's a structure of a certain way of experiencing.

160
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,120
It is, yeah, a structure of a certain way of experiencing.

161
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,080
And now he wants to describe that way.

162
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,720
So you could say it's something like, how's this?

163
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm trying to answer you.

164
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,879
I could tell you the whole story about structure, which I told you last time on Tuesday, and you would never know that I was talking about familiarity.

165
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:51,639
A kind of, it doesn't sound a bit familiar, and it sounds very, it's abstract, and it seems sort of special only when you're using equipment to take a stand on your being.

166
00:15:52,359 --> 00:16:02,040
Now it turns out that worldhood is really a more fundamental kind of experience, and that's what I'm trying to add.

167
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,159
You can't read that off-structure.

168
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,439
You've got to add that.

169
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:24,879
And I think people read this book and teach it for years, as I say I did, without realizing that he's switching from the worldhood, which is a structure, to the phenomenon of world, which he's asking, in effect, how do we experience that structure?

170
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,719
And now he's going to tell us a whole long story about that.

171
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,879
He spent years talking about it in the pre-lectures that lead up to being in time.

172
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:45,199
More and more, he sees that it's important, and it's sort of almost got it to the point where he sees that it's crucial here in this passage I'm reading.

173
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Well, I haven't read it yet, have I?

174
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,799
The one on 119.

175
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,319
Okay, I'm going to read it now.

176
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:59,919
This is where he introduces the phenomenon of world in the middle of 119, and the German does sort of, it was sort of in the middle of 186.

177
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,599
A lot of italics again.

178
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,839
The italics here is very justified.

179
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:23,200
Okay, now that wherein Dasein understands itself beforehand in the mode of assigning itself, that is taking up the equipment in order to take a stand on its being, by way of a for the sake of all that.

180
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:37,119
That wherein Dasein understands itself beforehand in the mode of assigning itself, is that, and now you've got to do some heavy correcting because I've said this, but you can't ever realize how important it is.

181
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,719
If you don't get this Vor alfin, which is the next word in front of you.

182
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,359
Great.

183
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:50,079
And translate it consistently, and translate it consistently the way I'm translating it, you can't make any sense of any of this.

184
00:17:50,399 --> 00:18:00,760
The Voralfin has got to be translated that on the basis of which, because it's very closely related to being.

185
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,559
And remember, back on page, what is it, 25 or something, being is defined as that on the basis of which beings are understood.

186
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:11,879
The bottom of page 25.

187
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:15,240
So here we are, and you should say, wow.

188
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:23,799
But on the other hand, this translator has switched it from Voralfin, which is what he said on page 25, to the for-which.

189
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,280
What in the world is the for-which?

190
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,639
There isn't any for-which.

191
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,959
It's not one of Heidegger's wishes.

192
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,879
And so you have to cross it out, or you won't understand.

193
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:46,040
So now we're going to see where that wherein, guys, I'm assuming is that on the basis of which it has let entities be encountered beforehand.

194
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,479
That's fine.

195
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,440
The wherein of, really you should say an activity of understanding, but this is just a technical point.

196
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,919
Act is a Husserl term, always mental acts.

197
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,840
He doesn't want this to be a mental act.

198
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,159
Since you don't know that, you don't have to worry.

199
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:18,439
The wherein of an activity of understanding, which assigns or refers itself, is that on the basis of which one lets entities be encountered in the kind of being that belongs to involvements.

200
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,119
And this wherein is the phenomenon of world.

201
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:31,000
And sort of come, it's very important, and yet it somehow comes at you in a mix of so many other things, you don't even see it.

202
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,839
And I guess we should go on with the paragraph.

203
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:41,120
And the structure of that, again, Vor Alfinn, on the basis of which, I think he does it even.

204
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,439
He's got a four-witch in there, the translator.

205
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,040
Now he's got a two-witch.

206
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:46,479
Sometimes he's got a towards which.

207
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,839
That would be enough to throw the book into the fire if there was an alternative that there isn't.

208
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,199
So you've got to read it, correcting it all the time.

209
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:04,399
And the structure of that, on the basis of which Dasein assigns itself, is what makes up the worldhood of the world.

210
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:07,599
So it's all scrunched together.

211
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:28,240
And so, and what happens really, on the sort of ground-floor, simple level, is the worldhood of the world, which is the structure of all this interrelated whole of equipment, has to mesh with our skills, Dasein's skills for coping with the equipment.

212
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:55,919
So you've got a holistic world of equipment with its equipmental relations, and you've got, thanks to having grown up in it and messed around in it and opened doors and walked on floors and eaten with forks or chopsticks or whatever you eat with, all that, because of that, your whole collection of skills meshes with the referential whole.

213
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,240
And that is really what the phenomenon of world is.

214
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,359
It's what you get when those two come together.

215
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,280
At least that's how I would like to say it.

216
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:23,839
So you've got a meshing of a set of skills, practices, and it's the condition, and that is the condition of the possibility of encountering a referential whole of equipment.

217
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,639
I say that we should look at 118, so let's try.

218
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:29,879
Okay, oh, lots of heavy stuff.

219
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:32,200
I don't know about your book, but my book is marked up.

220
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:39,960
In these next three, these pages, starting on 116 and going on in here, everything is marked up.

221
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,399
It's so dense, but it's so clear.

222
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:49,319
Okay, 118, first full paragraph, 85 in the German.

223
00:21:49,639 --> 00:22:04,359
As the being of something ready to hand, an involvement is itself discovered only on the basis of a prior discovery of a total, of an equipmental, well, a whole of involvement.

224
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:15,000
So, in any involvement that's been discovered, that is, to anything ready to hand which we encounter, what we've called the worldly character of the ready-to-hand has been discovered beforehand.

225
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,080
And that's, I don't know why I'm reading that.

226
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,639
I mean, it's true, but it doesn't help much.

227
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:22,280
What?

228
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,559
I don't think we've advanced much.

229
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,399
I'm trying to find something why I'm interested in this.

230
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,840
Well, the end of that paragraph.

231
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,319
What I'm really doing is doing things in a bad order.

232
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:45,319
I should have read this when I said discovered needs to be defined so that it doesn't get mixed up with disclosed.

233
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,719
And that's what's happening here in the last sentence.

234
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,639
It is essentially not discoverable if we hence, that is, what is not discoverable?

235
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,559
The ready-to-hand, entity within the world.

236
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,679
Essentially, not discoverable.

237
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:05,799
If we henceforth reserve discoveredness as a term for a possibility of being, that every entity, what is henceforth not discoverable?

238
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:08,639
Let's see if I have to read this to myself.

239
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:14,480
Wow, I see what I was supposed to be reading.

240
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,879
No wonder I couldn't tell why it was important.

241
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:25,359
The middle of that top paragraph, starting on the right-hand side, we're going to get the distinction between discovered and disclosed, which is what I want.

242
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:42,159
And letting entities be involved so that they are freed for a totality, that is this whole of involvements, one must have disclosed already, disclosed there, that on the basis of which they have been freed.

243
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,360
Entities get freed.

244
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,239
It's a funny word.

245
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,440
I have to say something about it.

246
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,960
When I pick up the piece of chalk in order to write on the board, in order to blah, blah, blah, I free the chalk in Heidegger jargon.

247
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,159
Most Heidegger jargon I've gotten used to after all these years, and it seems quite natural to me.

248
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,720
Why we would call that freeing the chalk, as if the chalk somehow is being held down and I rescued it, is beyond me.

249
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,520
What?

250
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,959
I believe so.

251
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,040
I think whenever you use anything in Heidegger jargon, you free it.

252
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,839
Does anybody have an intuitive feel for that?

253
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,479
Yeah.

254
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:22,399
Yeah, you let it do its thing.

255
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,479
That's what you're saying.

256
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,119
That's what it is to free something.

257
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,559
I've got to write that down.

258
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,159
Let it do its thing.

259
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,119
And that's what, and it needs you to do it.

260
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,239
Okay, now I can sort of understand when I see free.

261
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,119
Where were we?

262
00:24:45,839 --> 00:25:00,199
But that on the basis of which something environmentally ready to hand has thus been free, that is, I've taken it up to use it, and indeed in such a manner that it becomes accessible as an entity within the world, first of all.

263
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,440
That is, that's how the chalk shows up as an entity.

264
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,919
I like that showing up jargon.

265
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:13,799
So you let it do its thing, and that is, you let it show up as a piece of chalk.

266
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,799
So that cannot be conceived as an entity with this discovered kind of being.

267
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,440
Where are we?

268
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:36,440
But that on the basis of which, now, and not the entity, not the chalk, but that on the basis of which something environmentally ready to hand has thus been freed, and indeed in such a manner that it becomes accessible as an entity within the world, cannot itself be conceived as an entity.

269
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,879
That is, the on the basis of which isn't an entity.

270
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,679
That is, just keep telling yourself, the background isn't an entity.

271
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,879
It cannot be conceived as an entity with this discovered kind of being.

272
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:52,439
It is essentially not discoverable.

273
00:25:52,440 --> 00:26:01,639
If we henceforth reserve discoveredness as a term for the possibility of being that every entity without the character of Dasein may possess, that was what I said I should have read earlier.

274
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:09,479
That just means any entity, any entity which you can pick up, remember, or fix, or stare at, or so forth is discoverable.

275
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,119
Dasein isn't discoverable, and the world isn't discoverable.

276
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:23,319
It's because they're in the background, they're on the basis of which textbooks are discoverable, and chairs, and windows, and all that.

277
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:26,280
Now have I caught up with where I belong?

278
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,640
Let me see.

279
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,319
I think so.

280
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:30,280
Yeah.

281
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:41,439
So, and so disclosing a world, disclosing a world, is what makes possible discovering the ready-to-hand.

282
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,719
That's what he's leading up to.

283
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,839
So now we have to go on.

284
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:52,959
But what does it mean to say that that, on the basis of which, you see how frequent it is and how without understanding it, these pages would just be hash.

285
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:04,480
What does it mean to say that, on the basis of which entities within the world are proximally freed must have been previously disclosed?

286
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,399
That's what I want you to get.

287
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
That's the place where he makes the distinction.

288
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,199
To Dasein's being, an understanding of being belongs.

289
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,719
Any understanding has its being in an activity of understanding.

290
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:28,079
If being in the world is a kind of being which is essentially befitting to Dasein, and to understand being in the world belongs to the essential content of its understanding of being.

291
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,199
We're going to come back to that at the very end of today.

292
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:42,000
The previous disclosure of that, on the basis of which what we encounter within the world is subsequently freed, amounts to nothing else than the understanding of the world.

293
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,719
The world, then I don't understand this, towards which Dasein always comports itself.

294
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,319
I don't like that.

295
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,599
But that is not, that isn't wrong, and the translation is right.

296
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,520
You see, I don't, I mean, you comport yourself mostly towards objects.

297
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,479
I don't think you comport yourself towards the world.

298
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,319
I think the world is in the background and is transparent.

299
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,839
I can't fix it.

300
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,879
If anybody thinks that this is what Heidegger should say, and go ahead.

301
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:13,520
Yeah.

302
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,599
Or each dictionary and instead of having to do with behavior.

303
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:25,479
So perhaps it's towards which Dasein has made you always.

304
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,120
Aha.

305
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,439
The behave is fine for comport.

306
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:29,960
I'll talk about that.

307
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:32,040
But it's the two or the towards.

308
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:38,119
I don't think you comport yourself, that is, behave, towards the world.

309
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,880
But that's just weird.

310
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:54,440
If you have a sense of the world as the space in which anything is disclosed, towards which you can relate by discovering it and using it, to say that, it just boggles my mind.

311
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,000
I don't get it.

312
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,159
Yeah, go ahead.

313
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,440
Woo, does he have quotes around it?

314
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,360
That would save the day, but I don't think he does.

315
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:12,520
Remember, when he defines the world, he says when he's going to talk about the world as a collection of objects, which you can, then he's going to use quotes.

316
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,160
And if he did use quotes, that would save the day.

317
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:15,640
Where is it?

318
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,559
No, he doesn't use quotes.

319
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,599
That's the trouble.

320
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,280
Put quotes in for him.

321
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,439
That's in that last sentence.

322
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,880
The world, in quotes, towards which Dasein comports itself, that would be fine.

323
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:29,799
The totality of entities.

324
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,879
But it's not what he says.

325
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:37,240
And there are 17 editions of the book in which he had a chance to correct.

326
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,520
He didn't.

327
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:43,000
So maybe, maybe something important is going on and I'm missing it.

328
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,919
You always got to be ready for the anomalies, because it may turn out that what strikes you as a mistake is your mistake, that there's something important happening.

329
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:58,919
I can't believe it now, but then you never can, when you confront an anomaly, believe that it's what's important until you understand how it's important.

330
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,399
Yeah.

331
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:10,719
Let's see why you're asking towards yourself, Google is currently sort of not objects in theory in any case.

332
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:20,000
Even if you are comparing yourself towards the objects, then it's also at least foggy and comporting itself towards the world.

333
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,799
I'm not convinced.

334
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,359
I mean, he says if it's comporting itself toward objects, it's comporting itself towards the world.

335
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:34,319
That's like saying if you're comporting yourself toward the figure in Geschalt terms, you're comporting yourself toward the background.

336
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,919
That seems to me just the wrong thing to say.

337
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
The background better stay in the background.

338
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,839
But anyway, since Heidegger's on your side, I don't want to make too much of a scene of disagreeing with you.

339
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:46,559
Yet.

340
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,639
What world in which?

341
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:10,240
But I'm also saying comporting toward the general.

342
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,159
Well, I mean, again, he's saying, you know, you could comport.

343
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:15,919
Consider this.

344
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,479
When you're using equipment in a workshop to talk like Heidegger, a hammer.

345
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,240
You're certainly freeing the hammer, discovering the hammer, behaving, comporting towards the hammer.

346
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:35,200
But when everything's going well, the workshop's just not even, you need, doesn't even need to be on your mind.

347
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,520
Of course, you need to be familiar with it.

348
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:50,240
And I just realized a move you one could make, but I think it would make it hard to understand that if being familiar with something was comporting yourself toward it, then we'd have no problem.

349
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:59,319
Because we're going to discover in just a minute that, of course, we're familiar with the workshop, we're familiar with this lecture room, we're familiar with, and we're finally familiar with the world.

350
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:04,199
Familiarity is a way of comporting yourself.

351
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,159
That must be how he's thinking about it.

352
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:13,399
Okay, I think that blurs more than it helps, but you have to do what you can.

353
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:14,040
Yeah.

354
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,239
What's that louder?

355
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,719
I can't hear you.

356
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,400
It decreases.

357
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,240
Yeah, the object withdraws when you're hammering with it perfectly.

358
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:38,760
And I know what you're about to say, I think, and it's interesting.

359
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,759
And yet we're still comporting ourselves toward the hammer, even when it withdraws and becomes invisible, you might say.

360
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,760
Am I putting words in your mouth?

361
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,119
He doesn't even weigh with us.

362
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:35,559
Oh, that raises, that's a can of worms issue because with Searle, this parking example, for instance, that you follow a rule when you're parking, and finally, the rule he used to say, and I used to disagree with him every year, I don't know whether he's still saying it, that then the rule becomes unconscious.

363
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:42,640
And we're still following the rule because we know we must be, because we're still able to park, and that rule is how we do it.

364
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:47,360
And I want to say, not at all, that's just exactly what Heidegger says is bad phenomenology.

365
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:57,599
That when you got, when you get, when you finally get a skill for dealing with things, you no longer have any rule.

366
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:06,400
And the phenomena is that the parking becomes transparent, and the car becomes transparent, and the parking space becomes transparent.

367
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:15,040
And Searle has a line like that, which fits this, that what you're doing rises to the level of skill.

368
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:25,679
That is, something might become sort of something you're thinking about, which is namely, I don't know, how to get to teaching as quickly as possible.

369
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,720
That's what's on your mind when you're doing all this parking stuff.

370
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:36,880
But in case anybody was ever tempted with this idea, I'm going to take a digression and tell you what I think is a funny story that I made up once.

371
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:50,719
And I'm so sick of people who tell me that when you, in the old days, the expert systems people had an argument very much like what Searle used to have, anyway, about the rules for parking.

372
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:58,719
They said when you tie your shoelaces, you once had to know a rule, which is something like over here and make a loop and through there.

373
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,559
And of course, we don't even know what that rule is anymore.

374
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,720
So far, that's good phenomenology.

375
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:12,399
And then they conclude, but you can still tie your shoelaces, so the rule must be gone unconscious and still be operating unconsciously.

376
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,999
It sounds very plausible.

377
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,119
It's been believed since Plato in some version.

378
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,000
Well, it's wrong.

379
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,040
And the way you can see it's wrong is like a joke.

380
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Suppose you say that in order to ride a bicycle, you've got to have training wheels.

381
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,520
And only when you've got those training wheels on can you ride the bicycle.

382
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,719
And then you ride and ride and ride.

383
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:34,840
And one day somebody takes off the training wheels and you can still ride the bicycle.

384
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,480
Well, the training wheels must have become invisible.

385
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,559
That's the only conclusion you can get.

386
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:42,040
I mean, that's what makes it you're able to ride a bicycle.

387
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,800
You don't see them anymore.

388
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,520
So they must be functioning invisibly.

389
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,639
No, they're not.

390
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,399
The training wheels haven't gone invisible.

391
00:35:49,400 --> 00:36:00,279
You've got another mode of processing, an entirely different mode of processing, which is a certain, and what that is and how it works is a long story about skill.

392
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:16,680
But one of the, you don't have to believe that when your skill becomes something that is transparent and the object of the skill withdraws, that it's still lurking around somewhere, implicitly, tacitly, unconsciously, whatever.

393
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:23,479
Maybe there's just other ways the brain can do whatever it is that you're doing, which does need that rule.

394
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:33,399
In fact, it must be, because it becomes so much more fast, so much more flexible to the situation and so forth once it disappears, like in learning a language.

395
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:42,760
You follow rules for a while when you're speaking French, and you do it so badly, and you take so long, and you have to figure out what words to use and what situations.

396
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:46,599
And then one day, or gradually, you get so you can speak French.

397
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:56,520
And then you do it quickly and without any sense of it being difficult and with complete flexibility and adaptability to the situation.

398
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,400
It's very unlikely that it's the same rules that you had to go through to learn French that are now operating unconsciously.

399
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,520
So that can't be right for operating towards something.

400
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:16,879
But I gave you, read into what you were saying, something close to what you were saying, which I think is a very interesting proposal.

401
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:40,079
Namely, that just as the hammer withdraws and it becomes transparent, and the rules we can add that you were following disappear, so, and yet you are still comporting toward the hammer in some sense, you're behaving in a way that's directed toward hammering with that hammer.

402
00:37:40,400 --> 00:38:03,440
So maybe that's the sense in which you want to say, well, and even when the world has become so familiar that it's background and you don't notice it anymore and so forth, and it withdraws the way the hammer withdraws, the better you're familiar with it, the less you experience it, nonetheless, you are coping with it and therefore comport toward it.

403
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,199
I mean, that's how you have to see it.

404
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:16,880
It's just a bad way of talking because why should you not just say, well, only when you're thematizing it, you're comporting toward it, when you're noticing it.

405
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:28,559
Comporting towards something I want to say means noticing it, taking account, noticing it, paying attention to it, acting deliberately with respect to it.

406
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,599
That's how I would use comportment toward, but that isn't tight of it.

407
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,799
That's a long digression.

408
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,559
Sorry about that, but I'm still trying to make sense of it.

409
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,519
Let's go on.

410
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,399
Where are we?

411
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,520
Disclosing makes possible discovering.

412
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,799
That's what I just read.

413
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,720
That's the punchline on page 118.

414
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,399
And you've got to just keep it in mind.

415
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,360
From now on, you're going to hear a lot about disclosing and not very much about discovering, which doesn't interest Heidegger very much.

416
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:02,280
Now, I think, have I already read?

417
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,599
I can't remember where I stopped reading.

418
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,640
I read the part about discoveredness.

419
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:13,800
I read, yeah, okay, I read that all on 118 that I want to read.

420
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,839
Now, now we finally get, after a lot of talk, to familiarity.

421
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,480
He starts to spell it out, what it is, and that's on 119.

422
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:31,959
You get introduced finally to familiarity in a nice down-to-earth way.

423
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:37,320
The first full paragraph, German 86 at the bottom.

424
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:50,199
That wherein Dasein already understands itself in this way, that is, that's the phenomenon of world and so forth, in this way is always something with which it is primordially familiar.

425
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,960
So now you need to write down another important concept: primordial familiarity.

426
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,360
That means absolutely basic.

427
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:06,040
You can't have any world, you can't have any identity, you can't use any equipment if you don't have primordial familiarity.

428
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:15,079
This familiarity with the world does not necessarily require that the relations which are constituted for the world should be theoretically transparent, and how not.

429
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:23,960
However, the possibility of giving these relations an explicit ontological existential interpretation is grounded in this familiarity with the world.

430
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,400
They have to stop there.

431
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,519
That's fine.

432
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,639
That means you can do what Heidegger did.

433
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:36,760
You can describe the structure of the world thanks to your familiarity with the world.

434
00:40:36,759 --> 00:40:42,879
Nobody, so to speak, in their ordinary activity or in their right mind would be doing that.

435
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:54,480
But if you happen to be a phenomenologist, an ontological phenomenologist like Heidegger, that's your job to give that a kind of theoretical clarity.

436
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,999
And that's fine.

437
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,320
And so that's what he says we can do.

438
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,599
And now he's going to do it.

439
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:11,440
He's going to go on and give us a whole story about the experience of disclosing, which equals the phenomenon of world, which equals familiarity.

440
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:20,719
And he does it best in the lectures the year before he publishes Being in Time, which is back to the history of concept of time.

441
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:26,800
Remember, the history of the concept of time is a, and these are all on reserve in Howison Library, I want to repeat.

442
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,480
I want to make sure they're all there.

443
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:35,999
Plus, I'm going to have Heidegger in the latest Heidegger in Being in Time in German for a few people who asked me.

444
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,599
They're all in the library.

445
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,480
So when you need help, go look at how Heidegger said it in his lectures.

446
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,000
He was a good lecturer.

447
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,880
So here we are on 187 at the top.

448
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,559
And he's going to tell it to you.

449
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,359
And this is nice.

450
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,800
This is so nice.

451
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,680
Heidegger says, well, how am I going to talk about the phenomenon of world?

452
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,200
And that's just too big a mouthful and too big a phenomenon.

453
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,079
So he says, let's do it with rooms.

454
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,439
So for now, for the next five or ten minutes, you can do the phenomenology of rooms.

455
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,079
What a thing.

456
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,599
No philosopher ever thought of doing the phenomenology of a room.

457
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,439
So here we go.

458
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:27,800
My encounter with the room, he's talking about the lecture room, naturally, but it needn't be that, any old room, is not such that I first take in one thing after another and put together a manifold of things in order then to see a room.

459
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:35,720
Rather, I primarily see a referential whole from which the individual pieces of furniture and what is in the room stand out.

460
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:48,999
Such an environment of the nature of a closed referential whole is at the same time distinguished by a specific familiarity in italics, the only italics there.

461
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,639
The closed character of the referential hole.

462
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,239
Oh, this guy translates it right.

463
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,079
He doesn't call it a referential totalic.

464
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,279
Well, sometimes he does.

465
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:57,079
How funny.

466
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:09,880
Anyway, the closed character of the referential hole, he says, now is grounded precisely in familiarity, and this familiarity implies that the referential relations are well known.

467
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,599
That means just another word for familiar.

468
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:13,879
That means that, what?

469
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,599
That I know how to get into the room by going through the door.

470
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:20,440
And as he says in one place, when I open the door, I use the latch.

471
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,120
And I know that in the form of know-how.

472
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:28,439
I mean, I just know how to go through the door, how to use the latch.

473
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:35,159
I've got a whole bunch of know-how, which I don't have to know explicitly, that I have gradually learned.

474
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:51,959
Heidegger's not interested in genetic story about how each Dasein, who was once a hopeless baby lying on its back, unable to cope with rooms and lecterns at all, got able to do that by crawling around and opening doors and falling off things and so forth.

475
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:58,040
But when you get to be a reasonably grown-up person, you know how to deal with rooms.

476
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:04,280
And that know-how is, and you can see this, something Heidegger doesn't do, but I think it would have helped if he did.

477
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:20,000
Your know-how for your kinds of rooms is different than the, say, the Japanese know-how for Japanese rooms, or different from the know-how of people in the 17th century castles and their rooms.

478
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:28,079
They had different, I mean, you have these chairs that are fixed in one direction, and you have doors and latches on the door.

479
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:43,760
A funny story that brought this home to me about the difference between Japanese rooms was way, way back, I don't know, in the days of hippies, and I was in Japan with my hippie girlfriend who always had a guitar with her.

480
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:57,759
And we were in a Japanese inn, and as soon as we got into the room, she whips out her guitar and gets ready to play it and pokes the handle through the wall of the room because it's a rice paper wall.

481
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:10,639
And that's no Japanese kid would have grown up with a familiarity with rooms that know that you don't poke the things through the walls.

482
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,760
I was so embarrassed, I didn't know what to do.

483
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:21,440
But anyway, and that's because that's a different kind of room, and it requires a different kind of familiarity.

484
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:30,000
And maybe that helps make clear how much you take for granted, that you can lean on the wall like that, for instance, and nobody's worried that you're going to fall right through.

485
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:38,159
And then there's sort of rooms where you don't know, just to get, I want you to have a feeling that the difference between them.

486
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:43,999
If you're in a room in a museum and there are chairs, you don't know whether they're to look at or to sit on.

487
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,360
And this is often, if you're tired, of a serious problem.

488
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,639
But you haven't got the right familiarity to go with that.

489
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:59,239
Presumably, the people who once lived in that kind of room, when they were in that kind of room, knew which chairs to sit on and which chairs were decorative.

490
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:04,280
Okay, so he's going to do it all with room, and I'm going to go back to reading this now.

491
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:12,839
The closed character of the referential whole is grounded in familiarity, and this familiarity implies that the referential relations are well known.

492
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,840
Everyday concern has making use of, working with, constantly attends to these relations.

493
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,599
Everyone dwells in them.

494
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:22,359
That's a nice word for this now.

495
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:28,839
Heidegger's got this word dwelling, which means that you're, it's, again, like the background.

496
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,200
You're at home in it.

497
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:32,200
You take it for granted.

498
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:34,360
You don't have to think about it.

499
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,559
You never have to make it an object for you.

500
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:44,120
You just walk in the room and cope with it because you got familiarity.

501
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,720
And on 274, he's got more interesting things to say about that.

502
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:02,040
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

503
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,279
Now we throw in circumspection.

504
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,759
I'm never quite sure what circumspection is.

505
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:25,800
If I have to take the time sometime to list the various places the circumspection shows up, it's always got to do, that's sure, this much is sure, with what you take account of in coping without noticing or paying any specific attention to it.

506
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,720
And it could be as local, I think, as the door and the doorknob when Heidegger uses it sometime.

507
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:34,520
And sometimes it's big, like the room.

508
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:45,919
But whatever level, the circumspection is the kind of knowing that goes with familiarity.

509
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,720
It's a lot to do with know-how.

510
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,720
Except know-how it could be directed towards something specific.

511
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:58,880
It's the background know-how that lets you know how to use something specific like a hammer.

512
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,959
Your circumspection is what you can take for granted, the workshop, I think.

513
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,839
Yeah, Dave.

514
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,640
Yes, literally.

515
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,760
Yes, except that if you just say that, I'm not sure.

516
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,599
I think that's what it normally means.

517
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,000
The German word is umsicht, which is literally seeing around.

518
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,160
But I think that it can be done without noticing anything.

519
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:33,040
And the way you're describing it, looking around makes it too much sound like when I come into the room, I notice the doors and the seats.

520
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:41,279
And Heidegger explicitly says I go through the door, use the knob, avoid the benches, sit in the seat without noticing anything.

521
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:43,280
I'm just carrying on a conversation.

522
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:55,200
But, in my way of reading it, nonetheless, taken for granted in the background on the basis of a skill, I can do that.

523
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:57,759
So we'll have to discuss this more.

524
00:48:57,759 --> 00:49:02,719
I mean, okay, you take it in, right?

525
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:06,480
You said something more noticeable, like the last time, I think.

526
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:09,759
I don't think so.

527
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:11,679
You have to take account of the context.

528
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,920
Maybe it's not a big deal.

529
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:28,040
But I think it's a phenomenological, important thing to keep circumspection, familiarity, the background, and the upon which, all in the same box.

530
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,879
And then it would be not looking around.

531
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:35,639
See, that's the first phrase you used, but then you ended up with a better account of thing.

532
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,559
Not looking around, but taking, taking in, that's a good one.

533
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,279
Taking in the context.

534
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:42,999
That's sure.

535
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,079
Somebody in that Tyler back there.

536
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,000
I agree with Judgement.

537
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,360
Much broader than nothing.

538
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,799
Yeah, that's right.

539
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,480
Seeing is not like looking.

540
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,559
It's taking, and again, how about taking account?

541
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,000
Or what do you think?

542
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,319
That's right.

543
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,279
That's good.

544
00:50:08,279 --> 00:50:14,360
And maybe that's why I find so many different places where circumspection is being talked about.

545
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,079
Because it's any way, I mean, I think we're working out.

546
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:25,719
Any way that I take account of the context, I have to say, I think, any way except noticing.

547
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:33,160
I think that's the count of the context in what you're doing counts as circumspection.

548
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:41,320
And now maybe it'll help if I jump to reading this sort of definition of it, and you can see how close it comes to familiarity.

549
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:48,520
And, well, circumspection, this is the bottom of 274 of the history of the concept of time.

550
00:50:48,520 --> 00:51:01,720
Circumspection, oriented to the presence of what is of concern, provides each setting to work, procuring and performing with the way to work it out, the means to carry it out, the right occasion, and the appropriate time.

551
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:06,879
The side of circumspection is the skilled possibility of discern.

552
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:07,999
Try that again.

553
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,079
The side of circumspection is the skilled possibility of concerned discovering.

554
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:16,800
Well, I have to make a note.

555
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,399
They don't have a word for skill.

556
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:24,079
I've said, what in the world has the translator found that he's translated skill?

557
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,480
Maybe that's interesting.

558
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:34,000
Anyway, that brings circumspection and familiarity and the story about Japanese rooms all together.

559
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,639
There is this taken for granted, you could say, sense of what's important, when it's important.

560
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:56,480
For instance, part of your familiarity with rooms is to completely pay no attention to the windows except when it's very hot, at which point the windows draw you to open them, or when it's very cold, the windows will draw you to close them.

561
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:06,000
You don't pay any attention ever to the beams on the ceiling, presumably, unless they're fall about to begin to make noise or there's an earthquake or something.

562
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,079
And you never pay attention to the dust in the corners.

563
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:19,200
Presumably, the custodian's job is to pay attention to the chalk dust and so forth, but it's not in your familiarity with rooms.

564
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:33,759
So all the sense of what's appropriate to do in that kind of room with the kind of for the sake of which you've got and so forth is in this notion of familiarity.

565
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:39,759
It's a very rich and very down-to-earth and rock-bottom notion.

566
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,079
I think maybe I said all I have to say about that.

567
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:42,639
Let me see.

568
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:57,719
Well, ah, yeah, but the punchline in a way is several things that it's, I want to stress, and this is sort of the way I always want to stress these things: to get rid of noticing, to get rid of consciousness.

569
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:02,440
You notice this is part of the get rid of the subject and object, get rid of the mind and the world.

570
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:12,839
Mindedness, which is a John McDowell current term, is exactly what Heidegger does not want to bring in, what I've been calling noticing.

571
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,040
But anyway, so here are these places I have to jump way ahead.

572
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,960
You never know where this is going to come up.

573
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:27,399
On page 405 of Being in Time, line 354, sorry, page 354 of the German.

574
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,040
The second paragraph is us.

575
00:53:30,279 --> 00:53:35,559
Suddenly, he says this interesting thing: second sentence of the second full paragraph.

576
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:37,800
The self must forget itself.

577
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:43,799
If lost in the world of equipment, it's able actually to go to work and manipulate something.

578
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:51,559
That just says don't be noticing, don't be paying attention, don't even be monitoring what you are doing.

579
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:58,359
The more you can just forget yourself and thereby become skillfully absorbed in what you're doing, the better.

580
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:03,880
I mean, I've said it before, but I think it's important to keep saying it.

581
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:18,840
And now comes what I consider the punchline, which is that the ultimate kind of familiarity, when you stop talking about the workshop and the classroom and so forth, is the world.

582
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:24,440
And familiarity is what enables you to find your way around in the world.

583
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:33,640
You've got a whole set of skills that mesh with the whole set of stuff, referential stuff, equipment, and all that.

584
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:37,400
And that gives you a sense of familiarity.

585
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,319
It enables you to find your way around in the world.

586
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,760
It's on the same page, 405.

587
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,279
And I'm always sensitive to it because Wittgenstein also talks about finding your way around in the world.

588
00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:50,960
It's a phrase that just seems to naturally come to mind.

589
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:59,120
So he says on the bottom paragraph, there's all kinds of time talk in here because we're in Division II, but I'm just picking out the part.

590
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:06,320
He says, the familiarity, see on the left, second line of the bottom paragraph.

591
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:14,800
Familiarity in accordance with which Dasein, as being with one another, knows its way about in its public environment.

592
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,440
That is, that's just another version.

593
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,680
You could find it every once in a while coming up.

594
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:24,960
Finally, what Heidegger wants to talk about is knowing your way around in the world.

595
00:55:25,279 --> 00:55:27,120
Okay, now.

596
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,920
Understand?

597
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,840
Yeah, we got that.

598
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,520
Okay, got that.

599
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:38,000
Okay, now we have to introduce another terminology.

600
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,120
I'm sorry about this, but I need to quote something, which happens to be from Basic Problems.

601
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:55,119
And basic problems, he's got a new way of talking about the way Dasein is always outside of itself in the world.

602
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:05,920
I mean, I've been saying to somebody I remember, and I never said it here, it helps to think of something from Merleau-Ponty, where Merleau-Ponty says, We are empty heads turned toward the world.

603
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:14,880
I mean, you've got to get over the idea that there's something in your mind which is a representation of the world, that whole Cartesian picture.

604
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:24,679
And this openness to the world is what Heidegger calls transcendence, which is just a sick joke on his part.

605
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,279
I mean, it's a crazy thing to do.

606
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:36,360
I mean, it's sort of thumbing your nose at Husserl and the whole tradition, because transcendence has always meant the way you get out of your mind to the external world.

607
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:47,079
The amazing thing about minds is that from Kant, from Descartes to Kant to Searle, is that the mind has intentionality, namely it transcends toward the world.

608
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:52,839
Now, Heidegger just takes over the word transcendence and makes it mean the opposite in his lectures.

609
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:57,159
That's a kind of nasty move on Husserl and hard on the students.

610
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:07,799
I don't know why he does it, but he says, and here's his use of transcendence now: 162, middle of the first paragraph of basic problems.

611
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,720
Basic problems now, unfortunately.

612
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:15,079
Transcendence is a fundamental determination of the ontological structure of Dasein.

613
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:18,200
It belongs to the existentiality of existence.

614
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:20,920
Transcendence is an existential concept.

615
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,319
And now I read all that just for this sentence.

616
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:35,800
It will turn out that intentionality, that's how the mind is directed toward the world, that's Searle, is founded in Dasein's transcendence and is possible only for that reason.

617
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,680
The transcendence cannot conversely be explained in terms of intentionality.

618
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,359
That's an important move.

619
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:48,520
I just want to give you now a picture of what he's done.

620
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,399
I mean, he's, my commentary is wrong on this, by the way.

621
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,040
I mean, practically everybody is wrong on this, I think.

622
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:05,079
I mean, people think that the background is some kind of intentionality, that being in the world is some kind of intentionality.

623
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:07,480
Once you think about it, you can see that's wrong.

624
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:13,759
Intentionality is always some way that the, well, there are two kinds of intentionality to begin with.

625
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:15,599
I better back up and tell you this.

626
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:28,559
Because the whole way Heidegger is moving against Descartes here has got to do with, first he says, there's the kind of intentionality of noticing of minds directed toward the world.

627
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,400
That's what Searle does so well in his book, Intentionality.

628
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,959
And that's what Husserl does so well too.

629
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,320
And they're similar.

630
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,960
And then Heidegger says, ah, but there's a more primordial kind of intentionality.

631
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,800
Well, what would that be?

632
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,319
Well, that's what we've been talking about.

633
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,040
That's transparent absorbed coping.

634
00:58:47,040 --> 00:59:05,520
That's using things directly to do things on the background of a world, all of which doesn't have to even have in it noticing something where your attention is where your mind is directed towards some object under some aspect.

635
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:18,800
So the first move against Descartes, and that's what I talked about last time, is to say that there's a kind of intentionality where you're so absorbed in what you're doing that the subject-object distinction doesn't work.

636
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,960
That's primordial intentionality.

637
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:33,119
But it turns out that that kind of coping happens on a background, namely familiarity with the world.

638
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,920
And that isn't a kind of intentionality at all.

639
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,439
That's what I didn't see.

640
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,719
I thought primordial intentionality was a kind of intentionality.

641
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:58,359
So our most basic relation to the world, which he's calling transcendence here, is an openness to everything that we can deal with, and that's what makes intentionality both kinds of intentionality.

642
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:11,000
Thoughtful, deliberate coping with things of the sort that Searle talks about, which Heidegger thinks is fine but comes in too late, and something more primordial, more basic, transparent, absorbed coping.

643
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,440
All of that's only possible once we've disclosed a world.

644
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:20,440
And disclosing a world makes intentionality possible, but how do you put it?

645
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,079
I'll read it again because it's an important sentence.

646
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:30,599
So transcendence is founded in Dasein.

647
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:31,319
Sorry.

648
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,040
Yeah, transcendence is founded in.

649
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:35,719
Oh, is possible.

650
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:50,840
Transcendence, it will turn out that intentionality is founded in the Dasein's transcendence and is possible only for this reason, that transcendence cannot conversely be explained in terms of intentionality.

651
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,679
That's because the final thing, the background, can't.

652
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:56,040
Now I saw a hand up here.

653
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,399
Somebody, where was it?

654
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,679
Ah, okay.

655
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:17,960
Primordial intentionality is acting on the skills, which are a whole set of skills that mesh with the referential totality.

656
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:41,520
When you actually exercise some skill and mesh with or discover something in the referential totality, then that's, and if you do it in a totally skillful, absorbed way where you're invisible, remember the self disappears, and the hammer's invisible, it all disappears, and coping just goes on, that's primordial intentionality.

657
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,599
Okay?

658
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,839
Yeah.

659
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,839
Well, I tried I forget, what did I say about freeing?

660
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,800
I was happy about that, letting it do its thing.

661
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,119
Okay.

662
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:08,880
I don't know.

663
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:12,480
I don't think so.

664
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,640
What was the yeah?

665
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:19,920
Okay.

666
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:29,439
Can't describe consciousness in the same way as you did a history, but they're kind of well, yeah.

667
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,640
Can I just, I mean, take it in relation to what I said to him.

668
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:57,040
If you've got a take a simple case, if you've got a skill for using the chalk, then you free the chalk, but that is, you let it do its thing, you, and your skill is what enables the chalk to function as chalk, to be chalk, and that's all you need, I think, for freeing it and for letting it do its thing.

669
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:02,400
But tech, but doesn't it the same on the wall?

670
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,599
I don't know.

671
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:08,159
I doubt it.

672
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,479
I mean, I just doubt it off the top of my head, but we'd have to look at the text.

673
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:14,719
I think it's more global.

674
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:19,920
I mean, I think of letting as directed and like discovering.

675
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:21,919
Maybe, Dave might be right.

676
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,240
Maybe letting is global, in which case it would be freeing everything.

677
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:30,040
In fact, there's a place where he talks about freeing everything.

678
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:31,319
Ooh, yes.

679
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:33,079
I think you're right.

680
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:36,119
And it's a very, very difficult passage.

681
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:40,919
Let me get to it right away because I want to get to something else too before we end up.

682
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,400
Where are we?

683
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,359
Where were we going around?

684
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,119
119, 118.

685
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,719
Before we get, oh, yeah, we'll have to start with this next time probably because it's so hard.

686
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:56,440
But I just tell you where this occurs, and it's the page before I've been talking about.

687
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,319
A page so hard that I wouldn't want to make anybody read it.

688
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:13,559
But now Dave's going to make us all read it because it begins ontically letting something be involved, the first paragraph on 117, just at the bottom of 84 in the German.

689
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:24,040
Ontically letting something be involved signifies within our factical concern, we let something ready to hand be so-and-so as it is already in order that it be such.

690
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,520
So far, we're just picking up a piece of chalk.

691
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:32,120
The way we take this ontical sense of letting be is in principle ontological.

692
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:40,520
And therewith, we interpret the meaning of the previously freeing what is proximately ready to hand within the world.

693
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:46,919
Previously letting something be does not mean we must first bring it into being and produce it.

694
01:04:46,920 --> 01:05:00,119
It means rather that something which is already an entity must be discovered in its readiness to hand, and that we must thus let that entity let the entity which has this being be encountered.

695
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:04,040
Now, I thought the next sentence might be on Dave's side.

696
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,160
Let's see.

697
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:12,159
This a priori letting something be involved is the condition for the possibility of encouraging anything ready to hand.

698
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:16,239
So the Dasein in its ontical dealings and so forth and so forth.

699
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,800
No, I mean, we have to read that on our own.

700
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,839
But I don't see anything that says that you could let the world or free the world.

701
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,200
I thought it might.

702
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:27,599
I expected it here.

703
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:28,639
Where's the next sentence?

704
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,239
Oh, let's try it.

705
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:37,839
On the other hand, if letting something be involved is understood ontologically, what is then pertinent is the free.

706
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,359
Ah, that's the sentence I'm looking for.

707
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:51,919
The freeing of everything ready to hand as ready to hand, no matter whether taken ontically it is involved thereby, or whether as an entity precisely such a sort that ontically it's not involved, that's Dave's sentence.

708
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,559
That says ontologically, we free everything, doesn't it?

709
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:57,199
I think so.

710
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:58,400
And that's what you said.

711
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,520
Okay, so from Heidegger's talk, you could free everything from a piece of chalk to the world.

712
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:10,079
And I wish he had, you know, kept my distinction, namely, but you don't matter, it's only a question of words.

713
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:20,000
I mean, nobody's denying that there's a separate, there's a difference between the phenomena of freeing a piece of chalk or a hammer and the phenomenon of freeing a workshop or a room.

714
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,640
And that second one is the same as freeing the whole world.

715
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:40,720
And you can talk ontically about these specific kinds of freeing, or you can talk ontologically about the fact that Dasein's whole set of skills, all those skills that it has, makes it familiar with the whole world.

716
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:44,960
And that is, now that's the new language that David says I have to use.

717
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,719
That means freeing the world.

718
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,079
And that's all right.

719
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:57,239
The main thing is there is a world and it gets disclosed and it discloses, it's disclosed because we've got the skills for disclosing it.

720
01:06:57,239 --> 01:06:57,800
Yeah.

721
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:11,159
Ah, they're the ah, okay, yes.

722
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,800
Oh, maybe not.

723
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,079
I mean, I see now what you're asking, and I don't know whether I can.

724
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:28,359
See, yeah, I think that we might have to talk in office hours and look at more quotes.

725
01:07:28,359 --> 01:07:33,399
My reading is that intention, he calls, you don't know basic problems.

726
01:07:33,399 --> 01:07:39,319
In basic problems, he calls absorbed coping primordial intentionality.

727
01:07:39,319 --> 01:07:46,359
And in this passage, he says that transcendence makes intentionality possible.

728
01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:53,960
And I take it, unless he's going to mess up, he better mean both the primordial kind and the husseral kind.

729
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,679
That's how I got that way.

730
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,359
Now, I want to go back to this, okay?

731
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:08,439
Because I'm just about, now comes something so subtle and difficult that nobody else has even tried to deal with it.

732
01:08:08,439 --> 01:08:12,519
I keep trying to deal with it because I think it's so important.

733
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:19,719
And Heidegger only mentions it once because I don't think even he knows how to deal with it.

734
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,279
But it's right related to his question.

735
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:31,639
The question is something like: what's the relation between the holistic background?

736
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:38,519
Well, what's the relation between absorbed coping and transcendence?

737
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:40,399
That's his question.

738
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,679
That's my question.

739
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,720
Heidegger says something very quick and deep about it.

740
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:46,479
What would it look like?

741
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,199
The question is really something like this.

742
01:08:49,519 --> 01:09:00,159
If normally primordial intentionality is just coping with things transparently, and I see that we've been going around this issue all the time.

743
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:05,519
And now we want to know how are we related to this whole background?

744
01:09:05,519 --> 01:09:08,479
And why isn't that a kind of intentionality?

745
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:20,159
And if it is, and that would be the way I would think of if you said towards it and comporting about it and freeing it, you would think it would be some kind of primordial intentionality.

746
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:24,799
But now Heidegger's clear, the background is not a kind of intentionality.

747
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,000
Well, what is it then?

748
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,599
It's a way of behaving.

749
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,279
We behave in such a way as to free the background, right?

750
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,599
And what else do we do when we behave in such a way as to free the background?

751
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,960
We go into the classroom and avoid the chairs and go through the door and use the latch.

752
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,439
And when it's hard, we open the windows.

753
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,680
All that's a lot of absorbed coping.

754
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,000
It's a lot of primordial intentionality.

755
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,119
But you want to come back and say, yeah, but that's not what I'm asking.

756
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:55,439
I'm asking, what kind of activity is transcendence?

757
01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:00,239
World is closing, opening up the space in which anything can show up.

758
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,079
What kind of activity is that?

759
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:03,519
Well, here's the answer.

760
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:06,479
It's the very same activity as absorbed coping.

761
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:10,799
What else could it be than going through the door, sitting in the chairs, and so forth?

762
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:12,880
So, what's the difference?

763
01:10:13,519 --> 01:10:16,239
I didn't realize how important and good his question was.

764
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:23,439
What's the difference between transcendence and absorbed primordial coping?

765
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:25,799
Well, the only difference is this.

766
01:10:26,119 --> 01:10:38,920
I think, though Heidegger never tells us very clearly, the background is a holistic kind of coping which doesn't have a specific goal.

767
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,559
It doesn't have a specific towards which.

768
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:50,119
Finding your way around in the world or in the workshop or the classroom isn't like a job that you complete.

769
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:53,479
You notice it's got the same structure as being a teacher.

770
01:10:55,079 --> 01:11:03,000
The idea is there isn't any intentionality because there isn't any success conditions.

771
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:07,159
One day I finally succeeded finding my way around in the world.

772
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:08,920
No, that's not how it is.

773
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:14,040
It's something that's constantly and holistically organizing your activity.

774
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,119
And that's what transcendence is.

775
01:11:16,119 --> 01:11:25,880
Transcendence is absorbed coping that is holistic and doesn't aim at achieving any kind of end.

776
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,319
And there just is such a thing.

777
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:28,439
I just described it.

778
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:30,279
And it's called familiarity.

779
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:33,000
And it only looks very deep and puzzling.

780
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,439
And it is deep and puzzling because it's a kind of activity when you cope with things that are familiar.

781
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:50,920
And it's not the kind of activity that you get when you cope in any way, primordial or any other way, intentionalistically with something specific.

782
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,559
Or one more way of putting it, then he wants to say something.

783
01:11:53,560 --> 01:12:05,079
It is, it's disclosing, as opposed to discovering, is a way of comporting, but it's not a way of comporting that's a kind of intentionality.

784
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:13,920
But it is, sort of, because it's just a holistic mishmash of all the kind of intentionality we've got.

785
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:26,239
But because it's holistic and you do it all at once, and you're doing it all the time, and it's never something you achieve, then it doesn't count as intentionality.

786
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:34,479
And that's transcendence, or that's being in the world, or that's whatever you want to call it.

787
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:40,639
It's this important, it's disclosing, it's ontological freeing, all of that.

788
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,159
And now, Curtis, yeah.

789
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:51,119
Yes.

790
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,760
Yes, yes, yes.

791
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,399
Absolutely.

792
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,519
That's right.

793
01:13:03,519 --> 01:13:09,839
And it's good, and it's the upon which, and it's the background.

794
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,359
And really, let's do it in the simplest way, if it's possible.

795
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,119
It's the background.

796
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:17,519
What kind of activity is the background?

797
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:18,960
That's the question.

798
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:28,880
Now, Searle, for those who want to think about it, has a notion of background, which he sort of got from Heidegger, I think, because we used to give seminars together on the background.

799
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,799
But anyway, for Searle, the background isn't a kind of activity at all.

800
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:45,199
But for Heidegger, it's just a very peculiar kind of activity, which we just described when we described the way you deal with the room, which is different than the way you deal with the chairs in the room.

801
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:52,239
But if you put together all the chairs, the windows, and everything else in a holistic way, then they're the same.

802
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:56,840
Okay, let me read you my interesting punchline, which I'm amazed.

803
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,079
Heidegger just sort of says it and throws it away.

804
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:20,279
On 162 of Basic Problems, he says, just after saying that transcendence cannot be explained in terms of intentionality, the task of bringing to life Dasein's existential constitution leads first of all to a twofold task intrinsically one.

805
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:25,079
That's just what I described to you, a weird thing, a twofold task intrinsically one.

806
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:34,199
The twofold task is to describe primordial intentionality, absorbed coping, and describe coping with the whole thing, ontological.

807
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:41,720
Or the twofold task is ontical comportment and ontological comportment, if you want.

808
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:52,599
So it's a twofold task intrinsically one of interpreting more radically the phenomenon, the phenomena, plural, of intentionality and transcendence.

809
01:14:53,479 --> 01:14:57,719
And now he knows he's just said something important, because I'm going to read the rest of this paragraph.

810
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:14,119
With this task of bringing to view, along with the more original conception of intentionality and transcendence, a basic determination of Dasein's whole existence, we run up against a central problem that's remained unknown to all previous philosophy.

811
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:16,679
I mean, that's what he's doing there.

812
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,239
Now, I guess I have two minutes, because that wasn't my punchline.

813
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:23,880
My punchline that we got on 119.

814
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:40,799
Now that we've discussed the phenomena of world, now that we've discussed familiarity, and now that I keep saying they're the background, they're the upon which, what coin would you expect to drop if you could follow all this amazing juggling?

815
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:44,239
It looks like I've just described the understanding of being, doesn't it?

816
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,599
That on the basis of which being is already understood.

817
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,119
You guys are happy about that.

818
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,239
And he says that.

819
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,079
Here's the bottom line of it.

820
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:55,359
It just goes in passing.

821
01:15:55,359 --> 01:16:02,960
It's so obvious to him, I think, at the bottom of 119, about five lines from the bottom, German 86 near the bottom.

822
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:11,279
This familiarity, in turn, he's been talking about is constitutive for Dasein and goes to make up Dasein's understanding of being.

823
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:49,679
So he's given you, gradually, through all this fancy talk of familiarity, background, transcendence, and so forth, supposedly a complicated working-out and a worked-out phenomenological description of the phenomenon of world, and it turns out to be that on the basis of which anything is intelligible and copable with, at its broadest, most ontological, when you go beyond rooms and beyond workshops to finding your way around in the world, that is Dasein's understanding of being.

824
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,759
Okay, I'm going to stop with that.

825
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,519
Yeah.

826
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,479
Oh, great.

827
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,199
Yes.

828
01:17:09,519 --> 01:17:10,399
Okay.

829
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:11,519
Yes.

830
01:17:11,519 --> 01:17:13,279
But how quickly do you have to do this?

831
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:17,279
Because there are three papers I'm supposed to be giving very soon.
