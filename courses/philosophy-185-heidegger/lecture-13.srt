1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,001
All of that would be very interesting.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,441
Okay, now we're ready to make a big shift to something, if anything, harder than worldhood, if you could imagine such a thing.

3
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:14,161
And that's being in.

4
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:20,001
And Heidegger says that he's been doing the worldhood up to now.

5
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:23,600
And now, meaning let's go to where we are.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:35,200
After the one, which I take it we finish, we get on page 169 to being in as such.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:44,881
I used to think that was just sort of nice that he had divided it up that way, but not take any, not think that any big deal serious thing was happening.

8
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:58,200
It took me ages to realize that this is a crucial moment in being in time, because worldhood is definitely easy to understand as public and shared.

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:16,360
So the familiarity of all of us finding our way around in our familiar world and in our familiar rooms, that it doesn't seem, I mean, it seems relatively easy to knock out Descartes' idea that we're each a private self with our own private world.

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:29,721
And in a sense, to put a slogan, that my world is more basic and prior to the world, which is the Cartesian view, as I keep saying, right up through Husserl and Thart, and I think Thoreau.

11
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:43,080
But what's interesting is when you switch to being in, you switch to the phenomenon which is really most on Descartes' side.

12
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,161
That is, it's hard, and this is what we're going to be talking about today.

13
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm just sort of leaping ahead to tell you what I think is the really interesting thing that I've been worrying about all morning.

14
00:01:52,681 --> 00:02:01,240
I mean, when you think about being in, you think first, and that's what we're going to do today, about mood.

15
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:06,360
And when you think about mood, that seems to be private.

16
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,561
If ever there was an example of something going on in you, you think it might well be mood.

17
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:22,121
So Heidegger's really going to run up against the phenomenon that will be one of the most troubling.

18
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:23,561
I think we'll get there today.

19
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:27,080
And he has a very interesting way to deal with it.

20
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,041
But before we do that, we have to do something even far more general and harder.

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:46,640
What being in is basically about is the obvious phenomenological fact, which I've been trying to deny up to now, and which you all must have dimly sensed.

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,320
Something is sort of missing in all this talk about the world, and what about my world?

23
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:03,841
And what's important is that we're in the world in some particular situation, that we experience the world from some particular point of view.

24
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,240
So, in some sense, Dodzine is in the world, and that's what we've been talking about.

25
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:15,681
But there's another way in which it's in its world, and that's what we now have to talk about.

26
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:29,360
But we have to talk about it in some way that doesn't end up with a whole lot of monad-like subjects, each one of them having their world playing inside of them, so to speak.

27
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:32,961
Leibniz, with his view of monads, is the extremist view of that.

28
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,520
Each of us is a self-contained world.

29
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,241
As Leibniz famously said, monads, which are his version of subjects, have no windows.

30
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:45,200
Everything goes on inside of them.

31
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:57,280
So, now I'm just going to plunge in and start talking about the phenomenon that Heidegger has to deal with, and that is the being in.

32
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,400
He starts out, and that's why I warn you, the next few pages are very, very hard.

33
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:12,960
He starts out very abstractly, trying to describe the general characteristic of the being in of God's mind.

34
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,121
And so, we start on 171.

35
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:25,721
Just to orient you, there's now going to be two stages, so to speak.

36
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,960
No, not two stages, two aspects of the being in.

37
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,921
And one of them is what the translation calls state of mind.

38
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:37,080
I'm at the bottom of 171.

39
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:49,481
And the other one is, well, what the German rightly calls understanding, and Heidegger calls understanding, but what Heidegger means by understanding isn't what one normally means.

40
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,001
But that's for next time.

41
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:57,881
Right now, we're going to start with talking about what the translation unfortunately calls state of mind.

42
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:06,360
And one which might seem sort of crazy, crotchety point, but which is not so crazy, is to get something straight at the bottom.

43
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:10,200
Heidegger says state of mind and understanding.

44
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,921
That is, he puts them in that order.

45
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:21,561
That's important because later state of mind is going to turn out to be related to the past and understanding to the future.

46
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:26,200
And he takes up naturally state of mind before he takes up understanding.

47
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:33,960
All that I wouldn't harp on if it wasn't important in the second division to straighten out some confusion about it.

48
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:42,200
For us right now, we're going to do what Heidegger does and what the translation misses, start with state of mind.

49
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:47,561
And now, the question is: what is state of mind?

50
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:54,760
And why is that a bad translation of what Heidegger's talking about and calling state of mind?

51
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,681
Well, the German word is the Findlichkei.

52
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:03,040
You might think, well, good, let's just translate it, then we'll have the right thing.

53
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:05,760
But unfortunately, it's not a word in German.

54
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,921
So it's going to be hard to figure out what the equivalent English word is.

55
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,840
You won't find it in the dictionary.

56
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,881
Befindlichkeit.

57
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,881
If you took it apart, this would be how you find yourself.

58
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,441
And this is heit is always nuss.

59
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:37,760
So it's John Hoagland, who has a great sense of the sort of literalness of translation and no sense of what sounds okay in English, calls that says you should translate this so foundness.

60
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,681
That would be as literal as you, I mean, that's what it says.

61
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:45,760
It's about how, the nus of how you find yourself.

62
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:55,441
But there is an expression in German that has got to do with this, which you can ask somebody, the befindenzeesische, how's it going with you?

63
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,041
How are you doing?

64
00:06:57,361 --> 00:07:02,801
And it's out of that befinden, finding, how do you find yourself?

65
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,200
Meaning, how's it going with you?

66
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,280
That he's making up this, Heidegger's making up this word.

67
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:18,481
And in the 60s, in the hippie days, I thought this was where you're at-ness.

68
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,161
I still, I think that's about as close as you can get.

69
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,881
Then this turns out to be where you're atness, and understanding turns out to be what you're into.

70
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:33,281
And that is things were clearer in the 60s and 70s.

71
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,200
Now we have to struggle with it.

72
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,721
And what are we going to do?

73
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:52,201
Well, the best way I can, I tried in my commentary, as those of you who look at the commentary know, to come up with a word for this, and it has to do with the way we are thrown into things and affect affected by things.

74
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:54,521
So I call it affectedness.

75
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,201
Well, that's not wrong, but it makes it sound snooty or something.

76
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:03,321
It's got the wrong the wrong connotations if you just pay attention to the English.

77
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,361
So I take it back.

78
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:09,401
When I do the second edition of the commentary, which I keep promising, I would wouldn't say that.

79
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,001
One of my students, I forget which one, translates it disposition.

80
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,841
That's better.

81
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:25,161
But the trouble with disposition is that already has a meaning in English, and it's like having a a good disposition or a bad disposition or something.

82
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,561
And that's not bad, except it's not abstract enough.

83
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,600
So now I think we have to say dispose it.

84
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:35,160
That's no great, I mean, I'm not proud of it.

85
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,681
I'm ready to give it up for anything except so foundness.

86
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:49,881
So this is just that's how you should translate it unless you can think of some better way to do it.

87
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:50,441
Yeah, Dave.

88
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:02,201
The trouble is it's it's that might be okay.

89
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,721
I'd have to think about it a bit.

90
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,881
It is that's what it's trying to say, all right.

91
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,801
It's situatedness.

92
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,721
But why do I think it's not, doesn't feel right to me?

93
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:14,521
Yeah.

94
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:18,121
Good, good, good.

95
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,680
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,121
Eugene is right.

97
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:22,361
It means how it's going with you.

98
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:28,521
You can think of that as situatedness, but mostly you think of that as being here.

99
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:36,481
Of course, in a way, what fits with what Dave said is we plunge right into Dasein being its here, or there, or both.

100
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,401
We're going to have to talk about that in a minute.

101
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:51,201
But what I was resisting is that it's no secret, I hope, if you've been doing the reading, that the most basic, the natural example of the Finlish kite is mood.

102
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,400
And somehow mood, again, sort of tells you how it's going with you.

103
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,121
We'll back to that again, more than what looks like your situation.

104
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,481
But keep it in mind.

105
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,721
I mean, maybe that's the right thing.

106
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,001
I don't know.

107
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:24,961
What's problematic is, besides the fact that there is no such word in German, how do you try to make it up out of this Liebbefendensis-ish idiom?

108
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:28,001
But this is supposed to be very abstract.

109
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:41,121
It's the most general name for really how you're disposed, how it's going with you, how you sense your situation, and all of that is supposed to be most concrete in mood.

110
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:49,121
But he wants to go up a level of abstraction from mood, and then you don't quite know which word picks out that abstraction.

111
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:52,801
So he made up this abstraction, and maybe you just have to get used to it.

112
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:55,601
Let's look at it the other way.

113
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,601
What's wrong with state of mind?

114
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,881
See if anybody here has a reaction to that.

115
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:09,200
Of course, there's a way of hearing state of mind, normal way, which makes it not too bad, but there's still something wrong with it.

116
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,801
What's wrong with it?

117
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:14,641
Sounds a lot like what?

118
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,040
Subject.

119
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,121
Yes, it sounds like a mind.

120
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:24,121
It sounds like something that maybe Searle could worry about when he has a big distinction between mind and world.

121
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:27,400
So, and it sounds like we're looking into your mind.

122
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,520
We're going to say something about the mind, which is going to be self-contained and inner.

123
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,681
And that would be very misleading.

124
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:45,241
So mind is one of those words like subject, which has been taken over by, well, introduced by, Descartes and then sort of taken over by everybody.

125
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:46,201
Subject anyway.

126
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,921
I take it the word mind was probably already around.

127
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:55,241
And you have less of a feel for what's wrong with state of, I imagine.

128
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:58,760
But it's, I mean, you know, objects have states.

129
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,160
They can be hot or cold or such.

130
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:07,081
That's a kind of physical term for something to be in a certain state.

131
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:09,080
So you've got the worst of both worlds.

132
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:27,001
You seem to have, he's managed, the translators have brilliantly managed to find an idiom which is both misleading on the mind side and misleading on the state side, as if they had a little bit of the race cogitans in there with mind and a bit of the race extensa in there having states, like a gravitational state.

133
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:28,760
And so throw it out.

134
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:34,361
Whenever you see it, change it in your mind or even write a different thing in your text.

135
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,601
And when you write a paper, just fix it.

136
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,041
I remember I keep saying that.

137
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:46,760
It drives me crazy to read papers which are generally pretty good with quotes that are generally got hopeless translations in them.

138
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,201
Okay, now we've got, so we've got, we looked at the bottom of 171.

139
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,961
That's the two things he's going to talk about when he talks about being in.

140
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:04,881
And the first one is he's going to do is the state of mind, that is the Bothenglichteit one.

141
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:08,801
And he's going to start, we're starting with that on 172.

142
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:28,081
But once I wanted to say one thing about 169 before we go any further into it, this is just saying what I said, but I always feel that I have to show you where the text says what I said, partly so you can understand the text, partly so you can believe me, or challenge me.

143
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:37,201
Anyway, on 169, about five lines down in the, right at the beginning, where it says right at the end of page 130 in the German.

144
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:47,920
Up till now, our phenomenal characterization of being in the world has been directed toward the worlds, the structural item of being in, and then skipping down to the next paragraph about 10 lines in.

145
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:56,321
Now, keeping in mind what has been achieved in the concrete analysis of the world and the who, we must turn our interpretation to the phenomenon of being in.

146
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,881
That's just what I've been saying.

147
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:10,641
And one of the things that I think is interesting is that at 170, this is all sort of background warming up to plunge into something, which is going to bang your head in a minute.

148
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:23,361
About 20 lines down on 170, you hear him saying something which is important about his method, that it's part of what he rejects in the whole philosophical tradition.

149
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:32,721
That you should be asking yourself which is more basic, the understanding or mood, to put it in that way.

150
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:38,320
And just like you, it's wrong to ask which is more basic, the present at hand or the ready to hand.

151
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:41,200
In some sense, the present at hand is important.

152
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,681
That's causal underlying.

153
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,521
In some other sense, the ready-to-hand is more basic as intelligible.

154
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,800
And he's going to not take sides here either.

155
00:14:51,800 --> 00:15:05,801
At the end of the top paragraph, he says, we're going to do fundamental ontology, he says in italics, and he's going to talk about the characteristics of the phenomenon.

156
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:13,321
And then he says, if these characteristics of the phenomena that show themselves, then existentially they're equiprimordial.

157
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:14,520
That's all I just want to stress.

158
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:27,961
The phenomenon of equiprimordiality of constitutive items has often been disregarded in ontology because of a methodologically unrestrained tendency to derive everything and anything from some simple primal ground.

159
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,561
It's not Heidegger's way of doing that.

160
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:40,361
Of course, it just occurs to me, I wasn't going to say this, but now that it occurs to me, I feel I just think it there is a certain sense in which he is doing that.

161
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:43,721
That may be one reason why he gives up on being a time.

162
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:51,160
Fundamental ontology, which he's just mentioned above, is, I wonder if we read these two together.

163
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,081
Is he trying to say, tell me something?

164
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:57,081
Because it would look like fundamental ontology is looking for the primal ground.

165
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:08,200
It's looking for that being on the basis of which everything else becomes intelligible, the source of all meaning and so forth.

166
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,521
And then he would say, and well, and mood is part of that, and understanding is part of that.

167
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:16,121
Let's read the intervening part.

168
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:18,680
Let me I don't know what I've gotten into here.

169
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,400
The book is going to do fundamental ontology.

170
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:37,681
Consequently, if we inquire about being in as our theme, we cannot indeed consent to nullify the primordial character of this phenomenon by deriving it from others, that is, so forth, breaking it up and so forth.

171
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:47,521
But the fact that something primordial is underivable does not rule out the possibility that a multiplicity of characteristics of being may be constitutive for it.

172
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:52,960
If these show themselves, then existentially, they are equiprimordial.

173
00:16:53,761 --> 00:16:55,121
That's what I said.

174
00:16:55,121 --> 00:17:01,520
So there he I don't I don't know but it's the part at the end of so let's go on.

175
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,280
Fine, they're equiprimordial.

176
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:05,040
That's what that's no problem.

177
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:16,560
And the phenomena of equiprimordiality has been disregarded in ontology because an unrestrained tendency to derive everything and anything from some simple primal ground.

178
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:28,400
And he's putting that right after he says we're doing fundamental ontology, which means we are studying the being who gives meaning to all the modes of being.

179
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:38,881
We're going to find out what it what the mode of being of Daseine is that makes the being of the ready to hand or the being of the present of hand, the being of Dasein all possible.

180
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:44,881
And in the end, what gives them all a unity, which is no secret, is temporality.

181
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:52,240
So why is he thinking that he's not falling back into the primal ground if you?

182
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:53,361
I don't know.

183
00:17:53,361 --> 00:18:00,240
Maybe he'll discover later that he is and stop writing being in time and burn the last the last division.

184
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,040
Yes.

185
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,400
But then he has presented hands being the cause of retranspirations and being and what.

186
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:18,921
Good, good, good.

187
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:19,721
I like that.

188
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,920
That's right.

189
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,800
Let me put it in a more dramatic way that we haven't got there yet.

190
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:38,281
If he believes in the reality of the physical universe, which I think he does, he thinks that he's not deriving everything from Dasein.

191
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:44,601
The sentence I keep repeating, which we're going to get to eventually, being depends on us, but beings don't.

192
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:49,081
That's a sort of anti-traditional ontological question.

193
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,281
It drives people crazy.

194
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:51,720
What could he mean by that?

195
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,160
And it takes a lot of explaining.

196
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,121
But one thing he certainly means by that is that you could just take away Dasein and there'd still be electrons and galaxies and so forth.

197
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,240
Thank goodness.

198
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,281
And that's what your ontology, even your fundamental ontology, which is about being, had better be concerned with.

199
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:14,121
Where being means intelligibility, and intelligibility means depends on us.

200
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:22,201
You can't get from there to the fact that everything out there that we find intelligible depends on us and our finding it intelligible.

201
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,320
We'll get back to that.

202
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:27,320
The other thing that crossed my mind is what he says about the primitives.

203
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:37,081
That again, he's not driven by the ontological imperative to show that the kinds of being that he's talking about are the only kinds of being.

204
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:43,640
And therefore, he's not trying to have a complete system, so to speak.

205
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:53,400
Presumably, he thinks that if you did understand the primitives, you'd find that they had another mode of being, and presumably it would be still back to fundamental ontology.

206
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,480
But he's open about it.

207
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,081
That's that's good.

208
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:58,361
That's an important thing.

209
00:19:58,361 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

210
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:25,601
Fundamental ontology is thinking like mental ontology of all regional ontologies.

211
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:27,121
Well, okay.

212
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:37,440
I mean, don't you don't you don't try too hard to understand what Dave is saying, or Tyler, because it's things about but I'll say one thing in response to that.

213
00:20:37,761 --> 00:21:01,361
Yes, the move to explain all being in terms of Dasein and the mode of being of Dasein, which is finally temporality, is a move that Heidegger makes after he seems to be looking for something broader, and a broader understanding of being than intelligibility to us, and he goes back to that broader thing.

214
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:08,240
And you could consider this whole being in time, which is so full of interesting, important observations and phenomena.

215
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:20,000
I hope you realize, even if he gives up on this big claim that this is that you go back to understand us, you'll understand the basis of all forms of under of being.

216
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:23,281
He may decide that that that this has been too limited.

217
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,160
I think you're right.

218
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:33,400
And I think he sort of was heading a certain way and then got sidetracked into this and then went back to thinking about, well, how do I want to put the last thing?

219
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:45,160
That even if being depends on us, there may be something even more basic than being that does is how it comes out later.

220
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,601
But that's later hiding.

221
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:48,680
So let's not talk about that.

222
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,521
Let's you want to say something?

223
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,681
Yeah.

224
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,720
So it doesn't matter instead of something that's not the ball within it.

225
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,000
From some primal ground.

226
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,121
So derive everything from some primal ground.

227
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:27,160
Well, he certainly doesn't do it, even in being in time, and he does it even less and less.

228
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,560
That's all.

229
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,761
This is a sidetrack that I didn't expect to be on.

230
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:31,800
Let's go back.

231
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,201
So all we're doing now is just laying out what he's up to.

232
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:44,520
He's got two equally primordial dimensions of the in to talk about.

233
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,520
And they are, remember, mood and understanding.

234
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:52,041
And he's going to talk about mood, and that's what we're going to talk about today.

235
00:22:52,361 --> 00:23:02,200
And now, and this, this, the inness is what we want to talk about next.

236
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,480
And so we're going to analyze these two very difficult paragraphs on 171 and 172.

237
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,800
But 171 really is all of it.

238
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:15,480
The two difficult paragraphs on that page.

239
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:23,881
I feel I ought to try to explain what's going on, though I also feel I'm never sure what's going on.

240
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:28,121
But keep your eye on the ball, and the ball is, is he talking?

241
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:42,240
He's talking about somehow how Dasein can be in the world, having somehow its own world, and yet always having the one shared world.

242
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,361
I mean, that's the problem he's got to face as he makes this transition from worldhood to being in.

243
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:53,841
And he does this transition abstractly on 171.

244
00:23:53,841 --> 00:24:00,080
It's a lot easier to see how he deals with it concretely when you get to mood as a phenomenon and understanding.

245
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:04,400
But here it is, for what it's worth, try to figure it out.

246
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,280
If you could figure it out better than I can, write me a paper.

247
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,681
So it's something.

248
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:18,881
I'm just going to read.

249
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:25,280
The entity at the top of 171, bottom-ish of 132 in the German.

250
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:38,400
Top of 171, the entity which is essentially constituted by being in the world is its, is in italics, which I don't understand why, is itself, in every case, it's there.

251
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:48,480
I think the is means that that's referring to the fact that it takes a stand on its being.

252
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,400
It takes a stand on its being.

253
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,441
That's how it is.

254
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,361
That's its way of being.

255
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,800
That's existence.

256
00:24:54,801 --> 00:25:09,680
And I think that's part of the solution is, just keep this in mind, that Dasein has to use the public world, because one is what one does, and what one does needs to be all the roles and all the equipment that's there.

257
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:18,601
Dasein has to be itself in its own unique way by using all this public stuff.

258
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,761
In the background, I think that's part of the important move he's making.

259
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:25,081
So maybe that's why the is is underlined.

260
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:26,680
It's so it's there.

261
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:33,160
According to the familiar significance of the word, the there points to a here and a yonder.

262
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,320
So here and there.

263
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:37,960
Now this is going to get messy.

264
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,240
The here of the eye here is always understood in the relation of a yonder, ready to hand.

265
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,200
That makes sense.

266
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:52,760
Here, and then there's the chairs you can sit in and the briefcase and all that that's further and further over there.

267
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,680
And being where are we?

268
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:16,361
The here of the eye here is always understood in terms in relation to a yonder ready to hand, in the sense of a being towards this yonder, a being which is, what are we going to say, de-distancing, directional, and concernful.

269
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:17,800
He's just summing up there.

270
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:24,121
Dasein's existential spatiality, which thus determines its location, is itself grounded in being in the world.

271
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:27,400
Those two sentences are about the spatiality chapter.

272
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:33,000
The yonder belongs definitely to something encountered within the world underline.

273
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:39,960
All these mysterious italics, that means that we're still talking about worldhood.

274
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Here and yonder are possible only in a there.

275
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,601
Boy.

276
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:45,881
Now, what does that mean?

277
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,480
I thought yonder was the there, I used to think when I read it.

278
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,601
So, how can here and there be possible only in a there?

279
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:56,200
That's the first shocker.

280
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,520
Well, that's because there's another meaning to there.

281
00:26:58,841 --> 00:27:03,761
A kind of there which points away, that's the yonder there.

282
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,680
But there's a there that names the situation.

283
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,560
There I was lecturing about Heidegger.

284
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:14,081
From your point of view, there I was in the Heidegger lecture.

285
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:15,201
That's the same there.

286
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,440
It's not a yonder there.

287
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:20,081
It's the whole situation.

288
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:28,240
So there's a there which is the whole situation, and in it, you can have the here and yonder.

289
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:41,280
It's structurally similar to the de-distancing, which gives you the whole near and far business, and in it, you can have things that are near or far.

290
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:44,001
Dedistancing isn't near or far.

291
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,321
So that's what he's doing again.

292
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:51,040
And it certainly is confusing, but it's ordinary language.

293
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:54,160
Here and yonder are possible in a there.

294
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,400
That is to say, where a there is ambiguous, whether it means a lot of different there's or only one there.

295
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,040
I don't think he's told you yet.

296
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,601
There ought to be something like the there and my there running around, but we haven't got to them.

297
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:19,680
Here and yonder are possible only in a there, that is to say, only if there is an entity which has made a disclosure of spatiality in the being of the there.

298
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,520
So that's the kind of there that he's just introduced.

299
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:25,601
That's the situation.

300
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:30,241
The entity carries in its almost being the character of not being closed off.

301
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,280
That's okay.

302
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:35,200
In the expression there, we have in view this essential disclosedness.

303
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:43,281
By reason of this closed disclosedness, this entity, together with the being there of the world, is there for itself.

304
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:46,200
He is making it as hard as possible.

305
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,720
What does that mean?

306
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:54,440
Well, there's the being there of the world, and that's again refers to the first section of the book.

307
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,041
We know about the being there of the world.

308
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:59,640
There's one world, and we're all in it, and that's that.

309
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:03,800
And now we've got the other side of it, the inside of it.

310
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:07,000
The entity is there for itself.

311
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:13,000
That means that it has to take a stand on its own being.

312
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,601
Sometimes Heidegger, when he's talking about the most basic characteristic of Dasein, I'll show it to you when we get to the anxiety chapter.

313
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:24,680
He talks about it as the that it is and has to be.

314
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:40,200
That is, there is this kind of being which, when it is, has to take a stand on its being, and therefore is to be there for itself, it'll have to be somehow in the world.

315
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,361
I mean, don't think this is very illuminating.

316
00:29:42,361 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm just doing it because I feel I have to and trying every year trying to get it straighter.

317
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,760
When we get to the moon, which we'll get to in a minute, you'll get your feet on the ground.

318
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:50,920
Yeah.

319
00:29:51,160 --> 00:30:01,560
But it's not that that finds itself having.

320
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,520
Why do you say I like it, but why do you think that's interesting?

321
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:08,601
Okay.

322
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,680
Whereas here, the example that you have to do that, you cannot not do that.

323
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,081
Okay.

324
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:20,601
Yeah, it's got to do with throwingness.

325
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,920
That's the that it is.

326
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,200
And that it has to be is the understanding part.

327
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,920
And that it is thrownness in this situation in which it has to take a stand on itself.

328
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:34,720
That's what he's trying to get at with it's there.

329
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,761
Okay, let's go on.

330
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:37,361
Or maybe I don't have to go on.

331
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:37,921
Let's see.

332
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,841
I've got to see if I have to go on.

333
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:49,680
Well, yeah, we have to go on to the next little paragraph, on 171, and then I'll give up sort of, or hope that we've done it.

334
00:30:49,920 --> 00:31:12,240
When we talk in an ontical figurative way of the lumen naturale, the natural light, which somebody like Locke talks about, in man, we have in mind nothing other than the existing, when we, now, Heidegger has in mind nothing other than the existential ontological structure of this entity, that it is in such a way as to be its there.

335
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:24,480
I take it that means, again, I mean, he's just repeating it, that it has to take a stand on its own being, and then it would, then it'll be its there.

336
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,920
That'll be its way of being in the world.

337
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:39,761
To say that it is illuminated means that as being in the world, it is cleared in itself, and I want to skip a little bit, in such a way that it is itself the clearing.

338
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:45,520
That's probably the most obscure of all the sentences, this bunch of obscure sentences.

339
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:48,321
What is this the clearing coming in here?

340
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,361
Clearing is another word for the space that Dasein discloses.

341
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,920
I don't mean spatial space now.

342
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:01,521
I mean opening up a world in which you can encounter things and other Daseins.

343
00:32:01,761 --> 00:32:06,881
One of Heidegger's names for this is the clearing.

344
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,481
And Dasein is opening up in its activity, a clearing is what he's saying here.

345
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,801
Later, that term he likes a lot, and he writes it all over the place.

346
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,040
It's very rare in being in time.

347
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,400
But now let's try it again.

348
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:27,320
That as being in the world, it's cleared in itself in such a way that it is the clearing.

349
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,240
Boy, lots of weird things happen very fast there.

350
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,881
And there's a footnote, which is not much help.

351
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:38,200
He says openness, clearing, light, and so forth.

352
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:41,400
Later, he'll call this the open sometime.

353
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Well, I've got a way to put this, but I don't know whether it's illuminating or not, and I don't know whether it's right or not, but it might be helpful to think about it this way.

354
00:32:49,240 --> 00:33:02,041
That what he wants to say is each Dasein is its own activity of opening up a space or a clearing in which things and Dasein can be encountered.

355
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,080
And each of us has to do our own clearing.

356
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,920
That's how we, when we get ourselves assigned to a role and do things.

357
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:17,641
But when we do that activity of clearing, which is us, we open up a shared clearing.

358
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:21,000
And I'm trying to give you a kind of useful metaphor.

359
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:33,721
If you're in the woods cutting down trees, which is what Heidegger says he means when he talks about the clearing, is the space left when some trees have been cut down and hauled away.

360
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:43,000
You're doing the clearing, where the clearing means the activity of cutting down the trees, but you're making a shared public clearing.

361
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,680
I mean, I don't know if that helps at all, but that's the picture he has, and I think that sentence is saying it.

362
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:49,720
I'm not sure.

363
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,881
So let's go on to the end of that paragraph.

364
00:33:51,881 --> 00:33:59,480
Only for an entity which is existentially cleared in this way, which is that which is present at hand can become accessible.

365
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:02,080
And you could say, and ready to hand.

366
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,640
He doesn't.

367
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:03,920
But you could.

368
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,800
Become accessible in the light or hidden in the dark.

369
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:14,400
That is, once you've opened up the world, once you turn the light on for everything, that's the lumen naturale.

370
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,841
That's the clearing is related to light, he says.

371
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:23,360
Once you sort of turn the light on, then things can be in the light or in the dark.

372
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:28,881
It's that same move again: once you de-distance, you can get near and far.

373
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:32,481
Once you, what did I say the next one was?

374
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
The one we were getting today, how did I put it?

375
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:36,001
What?

376
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:39,520
Yeah, that's right.

377
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:48,721
Only in the, only in the shared there, like there they were in the Heidegger course, is there a here and a yonder.

378
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:56,321
And now he's saying only in the shared opening or lighting up of everything can there be dark and light.

379
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,801
It's a Heidegger way of thinking.

380
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:00,480
Now I think I will almost stop.

381
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,361
Let's see a little further.

382
00:35:01,361 --> 00:35:08,481
Only for the entity which is existentially cleared in this way, so-and-so, is there dark, is there hidden and light?

383
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,121
By its very nature, Dasein brings it's there along with it.

384
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:23,841
See, he's got somehow moved from the there to Dasein, it's there, and he has to do that because he wants to talk about being in.

385
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:30,961
If it lacks it's there, it is not factically the entity which Gasein essentially is, indeed, not an entity at all.

386
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,281
Dasein is its disclosedness.

387
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:35,440
That's the hunch line.

388
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,321
Gaseine is the there, and it is also its there.

389
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:44,320
And that's it.

390
00:35:44,321 --> 00:35:46,121
It's just very hard.

391
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,600
And oh, I've got to go a little further.

392
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:50,600
It doesn't help any, though, but I can't resist.

393
00:35:50,920 --> 00:36:03,001
Okay, skip a sentence and then Dasein is its disclosedness means at the same time that the being which is an issue for this entity and its very being is to be its there.

394
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,841
That's what I've been trying to lead up to.

395
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:16,041
Somehow, it's the Dasein has to take a stand on its being, and when it does it, it's got to be the it's there.

396
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:27,641
But now, skipping to the next paragraph, this paragraph in which this chapter in which we shall undertake the explication of being in is such, that is to say, of the being of the there breaks into two parts.

397
00:36:27,641 --> 00:36:34,440
Now, I don't know whether that the is just a general term for a lot of it's there's, but I hope not.

398
00:36:34,440 --> 00:37:00,121
I think that he's trying to constantly trying to say this very hard thing and never saying it very clear or very well, I'm afraid, that Dasein is the kind of being which is always open to a shared world from a point of view, or always acting in such a way as to find out who it is by using all sorts of stuff which isn't it, and so forth and so forth.

399
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,280
But I think that's all we can do with that.

400
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,721
I'm just going to look at my notes.

401
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:11,480
At this point, so by being it's there, Dasein is open to the clearing.

402
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,440
That's my bottom line on the subject.

403
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,120
Only I say, look at my own commentary on 165 for some illuminating quotes.

404
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:28,361
Yeah, I collected the quotes which seem to say something like this in various other places, which I'll just read to you.

405
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:40,801
He says, The surrounding world is different in a certain way for each of us, and notwithstanding that, we move about in a common world.

406
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,680
That's from Basic Problems 164.

407
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:46,080
I mean, just to show that I haven't been making up this problem.

408
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:54,160
Thus, Heidegger can say, Dasein is cleared in itself in such a way that it is itself the clearing.

409
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:02,320
Or something that he can say with respect to time, in the part we're not going to read, but is the clearest, because it's the extremist.

410
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:09,841
Although each person, although each one of us utters his own now, it is nevertheless the now for everyone.

411
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:13,601
I mean, this is all that is the same point.

412
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:21,121
Okay, now I am ready to turn, which is what much more fun and much more graspable, to the phenomenon.

413
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,560
So, eat your power bar or whatever you need to stay awake.

414
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,281
I know this is a hard time to keep from, but maybe we should have a power bar break at about this point in the course.

415
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,760
And we're ready to plunge into the phenomenon.

416
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,841
Then, why do I go back?

417
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:44,400
Just a second.

418
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,281
I'm probably not going to read this part of here.

419
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:54,640
Yeah, I don't want to read that.

420
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:14,481
I'm going to read this to myself because I don't know whether I've said it any better in my writing here than what I said just now until I read it carefully.

421
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:18,600
So I guess I can just say, then, of course, you see what he's opposing.

422
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,841
I'm not a stream of private perspectival views.

423
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:25,721
I've got to act in this shared world.

424
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,241
It's not that I've got an inner sense to talk like Kant.

425
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:33,560
It's not that each person has his own world, as in Husserl and Start.

426
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:35,320
You've got your own.

427
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:47,640
You've got your world, its world, the word its world means somehow a way of taking up the public world.

428
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,440
That's I keep trying to say it over and over.

429
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:57,241
I'm absorbed in coping with equipment and with others, and therefore absorbed in my situation.

430
00:39:57,241 --> 00:40:01,241
And my situation gives me a perspective on the world.

431
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,400
When I use my disclosing power, I disclose the same world you disclose.

432
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,841
So now, finally, we get to disposed of it.

433
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:16,681
And I've explained already why I'm going to call it disposedness and not state of mind.

434
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:21,481
And he covers the notion of disposedness covers moods like fearfulness.

435
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,561
And it covers the way things matter to us, like being afraid of something specific.

436
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,040
It's a very broad notion.

437
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:41,721
But the main kind of mood he's interested in is not being directed towards something specific, like being afraid of a snake or being afraid of snakes.

438
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:45,400
It's being in a timorous, frightened mood.

439
00:40:45,400 --> 00:41:02,081
That is the main thing what he's interested in when he talks about mood is that it's some kind of holistic background again, on the basis of which, directed towardness toward things as mattering things becomes possible.

440
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:12,081
So if we've got this overall feeling of timorousness and so forth, then directing ourselves towards snakes as threatening becomes possible.

441
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:20,481
And it's the background that he's interested in, and he thinks that's the primordial phenomenon of mood.

442
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:28,400
So and moods deliver us over to something, to them.

443
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,720
So that's the next move.

444
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:40,721
The interesting thing, the first thing, why have moods here at this piece where he's got two things, the Finlish kite, that is disposiveness and understanding.

445
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:45,201
Well, it's no secret that he's setting up a temporal structure.

446
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:50,561
And mood has got to do with what we are always already in a mood, as he says.

447
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,721
That we are thrown into moods.

448
00:41:52,721 --> 00:42:00,161
We don't get to choose the mood that we're in, and we can't just get out of it by deciding we don't like it and wanting to be in some other mood.

449
00:42:00,161 --> 00:42:02,721
In fact, he says moods settle in.

450
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,960
I won't jump ahead to find the quote.

451
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,041
What that means is that if you're in a grumpy mood, then everything looks annoying.

452
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,440
And it makes you even more grumpy, which makes everything look even more annoying.

453
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:25,121
And if you're in an optimistic and upbeat mood, everything looks like an opportunity and a challenge and maybe fun and enjoyable.

454
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:32,001
And that makes things even more opportunities and fun and enjoyable, and you get pulled into that mood.

455
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:41,361
And so moods can dominate you and settle in, and you are always in a mood, and you just are thrown into that mood.

456
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:43,201
You're at the mercy of moods.

457
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:48,841
You don't, you never, he says the only way you could control moods at all is by bringing in another mood.

458
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,681
I take that to mean like if you're really grumpy and depressed, you could try going to a party that's lots of fun.

459
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:57,721
However, probably that's just going to be annoying too.

460
00:42:57,721 --> 00:43:02,281
And that, but that's the phenomenon he wants to talk about.

461
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:09,721
And so moods are going to be the way we're delivered over, as he puts it on 174.

462
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:13,641
The first whole paragraph.

463
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:18,841
The German is the top of 160, 136.

464
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:24,120
He says, ah, look at that.

465
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,521
Maybe there's something interesting that I skipped.

466
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:31,961
It's a very top of 174.

467
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,280
I don't know what it's going to say yet, but it looks interesting.

468
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:44,200
Onto existential tense, Dasein is, for the most part, evades the being which is disclosed in the mood.

469
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:55,721
In an ontological existential sense, this means that even in that to which such a mood pays no attention, Dasein is unveiled and it's being delivered over to the there.

470
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:58,760
In the evasion itself, the there is always disclosed.

471
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:02,200
I guess all I want to add there is we've talked about the there.

472
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:22,601
Now it turns out it's the moods that deliver us over, throw us into, and keep us in the general there, which is our sense of the world and our sense of what possibilities there are and what we're up to, all the things that moods reveal.

473
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,881
So then you get this business of that it is, which is important, right next.

474
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:41,520
This characteristic of Dasein's being, this, that it is, is veiled and in and its whence and what, sorry, evailed, I've corrected something.

475
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,120
In, oh no, that's right.

476
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,920
Eve in its whence and wither, yet disclosed in itself all the more unveiledly.

477
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,200
We call it thrownness.

478
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,480
I've been using the term, but now we have to see where he starts using it.

479
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,601
The thrownness of this entity into its there.

480
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,241
Now we've got, we can understand that.

481
00:44:58,241 --> 00:45:04,561
Indeed, it is thrown in such a way that as being in the world, it is the there.

482
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,481
Now, that's true too.

483
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,000
We just keep getting this strange puzzle, but we're just getting a name it, and that is just the way it is.

484
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,361
It's the phenomenon.

485
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:18,321
The expression throwness is meant to suggest the facticity of its being delivered over.

486
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:20,240
That it is and has to be.

487
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:21,760
Ah, I knew that was coming up.

488
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:24,000
That's the bottom line about Dasein.

489
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:43,760
There it is, thrown into the world, and it's got sort of one innate structure, namely that it's got to act in such a way as to take a stand on its being, and that's the sense in which delivered, it's delivered over.

490
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,041
Now, and he's defining facticity there at the bottom in italics.

491
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,681
Facticity, and that's what he wants to talk about, not factuality.

492
00:45:55,681 --> 00:46:09,121
Facticity is not the factuality of a factum brutum, of something present at hand, but a characteristic of Dasein's being, one that has been taken up into existence, even if approximately it's been thrust aside.

493
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,281
I think I may have given you an example already.

494
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:21,480
You need something to keep in mind every time he does this factuality, facticity distinction, and that is being male and female.

495
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:23,881
That's a factum brutum.

496
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:30,920
That's just a present at hand property of organisms like us.

497
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:45,800
But being masculine and feminine, that's what your culture takes up and gives a meaning to, and then you have to take up that those categories and give your own meaning to them.

498
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:54,761
You don't have to do it consciously, and you don't get a chance to do it altogether because your parents are already making little girls into little girls and little boys into little boys.

499
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:59,881
But in general, your culture has a view about how little girls and little boys are supposed to be.

500
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:01,561
That's its interpretation.

501
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:07,960
And you have to take up, as I say, not thinking about it, but you take it up in your own way.

502
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,801
Not every little girl takes up the way the culture wants little girls to be.

503
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:13,720
And it's the same with boys.

504
00:47:13,721 --> 00:47:16,920
So that's the example to keep in mind.

505
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:26,280
As I was talking, I just got struck by something I have to say, just for the record of this, is that when I talk, I've got to go back to something.

506
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:29,801
Maybe it's wrong, but it's interesting enough to go back for a minute.

507
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:40,040
When I said that there was this structure in which you always get the, on the basis of which characteristic, and then you get what happens on the basis of it.

508
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,920
I'm going to repeat it.

509
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:47,721
So you've got the spatiality of de-distancing, and on the basis of that, you've got near and far.

510
00:47:47,721 --> 00:47:53,241
You've got the lighting of the clearing, and on the basis of this, you've got hidden and lit up.

511
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:54,601
What was the third one?

512
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,480
You've got the there.

513
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:02,161
Oh, yes, you've got the basic there that means the here, the situation there.

514
00:48:02,161 --> 00:48:05,360
And on the basis of that, you've got here and yonder.

515
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:07,440
You know what that is, I think?

516
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:14,561
That's the distinction between the ontological and the ontic, or the existential and the existential.

517
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:26,881
The ontological existential is always that on the basis of which, and then you get an existential ontic story about near and far, dark and light.

518
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,560
I'll keep forgetting one of them.

519
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,241
What am I missing this time?

520
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,960
Near and far.

521
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,241
Oh, there's the other kind of near and far.

522
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:51,920
The distance kind you get on the basis of de-distancing, and the near and far in the sense of here and yonder that you get in the sense of really kind directional, directional kind, I guess.

523
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,920
Anyway, but I think that's interesting.

524
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,321
I think that's just not any old structure.

525
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:58,640
That's the whole way the book is supposed to work.

526
00:48:58,641 --> 00:49:08,881
You're supposed to always go back from the ontic existential to the ontological existential condition of the possibility of that.

527
00:49:08,881 --> 00:49:13,121
Or better to talk like Heidegger, that you get the background.

528
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:13,841
That's not Heidegger.

529
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,920
Well, sometimes he says background, but usually you get the Voral Hin.

530
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:26,961
You get that on the basis of which these ontic existential things become possible, intelligible, and doable.

531
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,001
Okay, that was for me almost, but if it turns out to be true, it's worth knowing.

532
00:49:32,241 --> 00:49:33,601
Now, let's see.

533
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:35,760
The moods settle in.

534
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:37,761
I think that's really over here.

535
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,241
So, Dasein always has a mood, he says, about 10 lines sound on 173.

536
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:47,161
That might seem obvious, but it isn't obvious.

537
00:49:47,161 --> 00:49:48,680
And sometimes he says that.

538
00:49:48,681 --> 00:50:07,640
There's a place where in another lecture, I don't think I brought it with me, where he says the most obvious moods are the most hidden moods are the moods that just seem obvious, that you're in all the time and that you don't even notice that you're in, and that's the way moods are most powerful.

539
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:14,361
They are always setting up your day and what you notice, and what you try to do and what you don't try to do.

540
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:24,281
That's the sense in which you're always in a mood, and as he says, even the paleo-balanced mood and so forth is not nothing at all.

541
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,440
And now, what do you learn from your mood?

542
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,961
Somebody already said that.

543
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,841
I said it, but somebody said it first.

544
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,920
I think maybe it was Eugene.

545
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:39,881
That a mood manifests how one is or how one is faring, he says at the middle of 173.

546
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:42,920
That's on 134 of the German.

547
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,281
That is, at the end of that paragraph.

548
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:49,721
A mood manifests how one is, how one is faring.

549
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,400
In this, how one is, having a mood brings being to its there.

550
00:50:55,721 --> 00:51:04,681
So now we're, you see, now that's an important line to me, because remember, I said that he's going to discuss phenomena that are most Cartesian, seeming.

551
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:17,801
And the fact that each of us have its, each of us have our there, each of us have our mood, each of us have our point of view, all of that is what the Cartesian would try to make the most of.

552
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:28,201
And he's got to constantly say, our mood, our there, our world is always correlative with the world.

553
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,001
We are like a perspective on the world.

554
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:40,481
We are open to the world, but I'm open to the world from here, and you're open to the world from over there, and that's very important.

555
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,241
Sometimes I tried the idea that it's like we're windows on the world.

556
00:51:46,241 --> 00:51:52,400
Each of us looking out through our window sees the same world, and we don't see the window.

557
00:51:52,400 --> 00:52:07,521
I mean, that's when it starts to look Cartesian, as if somehow we were all inside, and there wasn't any window, and we had to sort of figure out what was, we had our internal representations, and we had to try to figure out what's out there.

558
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:11,200
It's like this is this business of the clearing.

559
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:19,681
It's we're looking out on the clearing, we're clearing the clearing, we're opening it, disclosing it, lighting it up, but from somewhere.

560
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:21,120
That's the being in.

561
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,721
Okay, I saw a hand, because I keep repeating these things, and I feel somebody has a different way to say it.

562
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:34,161
How is it that that is any different than a bunch of minds have a word?

563
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:36,961
Oh, you're right, that's the right question.

564
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,680
And at the right moment, well, I'm heading into that.

565
00:52:39,681 --> 00:53:01,520
You have to be able to understand the phenomenon of moods in such a way that you can't assimilate it to a bunch of minds, each having its own representation of the world, or having on different colored glasses, you might think, or projecting different feelings onto the world as rosy or gray and so forth.

566
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,040
That's just what we're heading toward.

567
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:32,040
That's what I meant when I said that this is a very hard chapter, because that seems, if ever there seemed to be a condition in which there's something inner in you, namely your mood, and it's something inner in me, namely my mood, and I project on the world, it's being annoying because I'm in a disgruntled mood, and you project on the world, it's being challenging because you're in an upbeat challenge, occasion mood, opportunity mood.

568
00:53:32,361 --> 00:53:46,761
That's the way it looked, has looked at every philosopher up to Heidegger, insofar as any philosopher even bothered to think about moods, which I think Heidegger says nobody did except Aristotle a bit in talking in the rhetoric.

569
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:48,200
So that's, you're right.

570
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,000
That's the problem, which Heidegger has an answer to.

571
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:56,761
Very interesting answer, which gets him into more problems, which we will talk about as we get there.

572
00:53:59,241 --> 00:54:00,120
So where are we?

573
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,920
Moods reveal how it's going with a particular Daseine.

574
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,121
I said that.

575
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,160
I'll just read one more sentence where I was.

576
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:16,281
And having a mood Dasein is always disclosed mood-wise as that entity to which it has been delivered over in its being.

577
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:22,440
And in this way, it has been delivered over to the being which in existing it has to be.

578
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:30,040
That's just more Heidegger talk for the moods tell you, moods are your where you're at.

579
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:32,681
That's what he's trying to say.

580
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:34,361
And they perpetuate themselves.

581
00:54:34,361 --> 00:54:37,000
I said I didn't know where that was, but now we've got there.

582
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,241
There he says that at the bottom of 175.

583
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:46,841
The bare mood discloses the there more primordially.

584
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:49,161
We'll get to the previous sentence in a minute.

585
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:55,400
But Corella, correspondingly, it closes off more stubbornly than any not perceiving.

586
00:54:55,641 --> 00:54:57,801
This is shown by bad moods.

587
00:54:57,801 --> 00:55:01,281
Just I've already given you the example, so I won't do it again.

588
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,041
Let's see.

589
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:08,081
And moods disclose the world in a primordial way.

590
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,600
I think that's important.

591
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,200
The very middle of 175.

592
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:12,240
Ontologically.

593
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:17,521
Now we're going to talk about the way moods have this kind of background upon which character.

594
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:27,680
Ontologically, mood is a primordial kind of being for Dasein in which Dasein is disclosed to itself prior to all cognition and volition and beyond their range of disclosure.

595
00:55:27,681 --> 00:55:29,920
Sorry, that doesn't tell you about the upon which.

596
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:31,841
I missed thought.

597
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:34,961
This is still about individual moods.

598
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:52,320
Individual moods disclose to individual Daseins how it's going with them in a way that's much more, I guess you could sort of say reliable than how they reflectively think it's going with them or how they wish it was going with them or how they'd like other people to think it's going with them.

599
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:58,000
I mean, what's really telling you how it's going with you, whether you like it or not, is your mood.

600
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,361
That's what Heidegger says.

601
00:55:59,361 --> 00:56:01,681
But that's not facing his problem yet.

602
00:56:01,681 --> 00:56:02,961
We're getting there.

603
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:14,800
Now, the next thing is, and now we are facing his problem, moods are not going to be inner, and they're not projected on the world.

604
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:16,321
And that's not an argument yet.

605
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:18,320
That's just what he's going to tell you he's not.

606
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:19,280
He's against.

607
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:21,601
The bottom of 175.

608
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:24,080
Bottom of 136 in German.

609
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:40,640
Now, from the beginning of the paragraph, from what has been said, we can see already that disposedness is very remote from anything like coming across a psychical condition by the kind of apprehending, which first turns around and then back.

610
00:56:40,641 --> 00:56:43,521
That's a very complicated way of saying reflection.

611
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:49,480
That is, you could, it is not the kind of inner state that you come about on reflection.

612
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:54,761
That isn't to say that maybe sometime, under some conditions, you could.

613
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:56,840
And Heidegger's going to keep that open.

614
00:56:56,841 --> 00:57:00,920
But right now he's telling you, basically, that's not what moods are doing.

615
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:11,721
Indeed, it is so far from this that only because the there has already been disclosed in a disposedness can imminent reflection come across experiences at all.

616
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,841
And remember, experiences with a capital E is er labeness, private.

617
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:30,681
So imminent, so only because you stop just doing what you're doing and reflect on it, can you discover that you've been in a disgruntled mood all along?

618
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:32,440
That's what he's saying here.

619
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,480
The bear mood discloses the there more primordially, but correspondingly closes it off.

620
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,120
I read that.

621
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:38,761
Okay.

622
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:44,201
So I just read this one because I wanted to be clear and we'll come back to it.

623
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:52,680
That just as Heidegger thinks that there is, I'm beginning the sentence without knowing where I'm head.

624
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:55,481
Well, I know where I'm heading, but I don't know.

625
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,040
Ah, yes, the other mind thinks.

626
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:15,001
Just as Heidegger thinks that there is a problem sometimes of knowing other minds when people are being weird and secretive or pretending to be somebody they aren't, like in Second Life or something, then you've got a problem about other minds.

627
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,080
But normally you don't.

628
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,161
Now he's saying the same thing here.

629
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:23,160
You could have private psychological mood states.

630
00:58:23,161 --> 00:58:33,841
Heidegger's too good a phenomenologist and too smart a philosopher to just say outrageous things and leave the view he's against as sort of mouth.

631
00:58:33,841 --> 00:58:36,321
Heidegger never wants to smash the view he's against.

632
00:58:36,321 --> 00:58:40,480
He wants to sort of situate it, relativize it, localize it.

633
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,480
Sure, sometimes there's a problem of other minds.

634
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:53,281
In these very peculiar breakdown, unready-to-hand tight conditions, you don't know what the other person's thinking and you have to figure it out or try to feel it by empathy.

635
00:58:53,281 --> 00:59:02,001
Now he's saying, and I'll get to it later, there are conditions in which you can reflect and discover that there are moods in you, but that's not the normal thing.

636
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:09,601
The normal thing, just to use the funny English expression that we're lucky to have, it's not that there are moods in me, but I'm in a mood.

637
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,760
That's Heidegger's pick, which we're just about to get to now.

638
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:21,521
To say that I'm in a mood is to say that it's like being in an atmosphere.

639
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,281
I don't jump ahead.

640
00:59:23,281 --> 00:59:25,121
I'll get there in just a second, though.

641
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,561
So it's not an psychological state.

642
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,160
Ah, yeah, we're ready just for that.

643
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:31,840
I just read that now.

644
00:59:31,841 --> 00:59:33,680
And it's not projection.

645
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:43,201
I just wanted to read that, because if it were a private state, so that I was sort of privately disgruntled, then we'd have the question, and how come the whole world looks gray to me?

646
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:44,240
Well, that's easy.

647
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:46,881
I project on it my disgruntlement.

648
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:51,120
That's been, insofar as anybody's had a view, the traditional view.

649
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,560
It's also Sartre's view.

650
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:59,440
I mean, it's, since not very many people have had it, he's my favorite character for seemingly getting it wrong.

651
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:10,161
I mean, the idea is, and psychologists have it by the dozens, that somehow or other we project our moods onto the world, but they're really in us.

652
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:21,881
On 176, Heidegger says, and he just denies it, about ten lines down, after the italics.

653
01:00:24,361 --> 01:00:25,881
Well, I mean, let's do the italics.

654
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:27,560
That's the ontological mood again.

655
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:36,361
The mood has already disclosed, in every case, being in the world as a whole and makes it possible, first of all, to direct oneself towards something.

656
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:39,400
It's that upon which you direct yourself.

657
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:45,400
Having a mood now, he says, he just asserts, is not related to the psychical in the first instance.

658
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:55,640
That is, it's not first some private thing, and is not itself an inner condition, which then reaches forth in an enigmatical way and puts its marks on things and persons.

659
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:56,920
That's a neat sentence.

660
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,480
What that sentence says is moods are not private things that get projected onto things.

661
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,361
Moreover, the crucial word is enigmatical, because what would that be?

662
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:13,001
You just can't just solve the problem by saying you've got this inner mood that you project it on to the chairs.

663
01:01:13,241 --> 01:01:22,200
I'm disgruntled, and I see X as annoying because I project my disgruntlement onto X and see X as annoying.

664
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:22,841
What is that?

665
01:01:22,841 --> 01:01:24,201
That's just magic.

666
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,640
Heidegger thinks that's not going to help any.

667
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:32,840
And that sort of names the problem and gets rid of it without ever facing it.

668
01:01:32,841 --> 01:01:34,681
So how is Heidegger going to do it?

669
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:42,120
Well, Heidegger thinks that moods are, and this is why I want to make sure and get there, which I have, and that's great.

670
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,680
And I'm going to have to read from other places.

671
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:50,120
He doesn't do much of the phenomenological description of mood in being in time.

672
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:57,081
So I'm going to read to you about shared moods in my commentary on 171.

673
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,241
And then from there, I'll tell you where it says it.

674
01:02:00,241 --> 01:02:01,440
You can look.

675
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:01,680
Okay.

676
01:02:02,641 --> 01:02:07,920
That's in basic problems, I think.

677
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,200
Oh, I have to go to the footnote.

678
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,081
What chapter are we, Pastor Tan?

679
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:18,241
And it's footnote 3.

680
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:31,920
No, it's in the fundamental concepts of metaphysics, which is that's out too in English.

681
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:38,241
And it's on page 66 of the fundamental principles of metaphysics.

682
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,361
And here it is.

683
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:40,640
I'm going to read it.

684
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,520
And this is really, this is the basic phenomenon.

685
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,800
Finally, we got there.

686
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:56,321
And it's, I think you can get everything you need about mood that Heidegger's trying to make work out of that, this very neat, just simple description of what it's like to have moods.

687
01:02:56,321 --> 01:03:02,400
A person, as we say, is well, sorry, let's start again.

688
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,121
A, as we say, well-disposed person brings a good mood to a group.

689
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:17,041
In this case, does he produce in himself a psychic experience in order then to transfer it to the others, like the way infectious germs wander from one organism to another?

690
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:22,801
I mean, he's just saying, whatever it is, when somebody's in a good mood, it makes the mood people into a good mood.

691
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:27,841
We don't really understand that, and it's not going to help to say it sort of projects it over everybody.

692
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:40,641
Or another person is in a group that in its manner of being, and another person is in a group that in its manner of being, it's a funny translation there, dampens and depresses everything.

693
01:03:40,641 --> 01:03:42,561
No one is outgoing.

694
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,321
What do we learn from this?

695
01:03:44,361 --> 01:03:47,400
Moods are not accompanying phenomena in italics.

696
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,321
I don't know why bothered the italics.

697
01:03:49,321 --> 01:03:53,881
Rather, they are the sort of thing that determines being with one another in advance.

698
01:03:53,881 --> 01:04:00,440
It seems as if, so to speak, the mood is in each case already there, like an atmosphere.

699
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,761
I take that to be the crucial move.

700
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:07,721
Moods are holistic, and their way of being is like an atmosphere.

701
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:09,241
I'll explain that in a minute.

702
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:12,521
In which we are steeped and by which we are thoroughly determined.

703
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,400
It not only seems as if this were so, it is so.

704
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:24,440
And in light of these facts, it's necessary to dispense with the psychology of feelings, experience, and I would say projection, and he says consciousness.

705
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:28,601
Okay, what is it to say a mood is like an atmosphere?

706
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:34,200
Well, it's to say that it's already there.

707
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:38,761
You don't sort of bring it with you or produce it.

708
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:41,641
You're always already in a mood.

709
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:46,521
And now comes this mood which he's making without making it explicit.

710
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,281
There is your own private mood, and we'll get back to that.

711
01:04:50,281 --> 01:04:52,600
But generally, you are in a shared mood.

712
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,400
I mean, the class, you can talk about the mood in the room.

713
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,400
People who are business consultants and so forth do that.

714
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:13,721
The mood in the room is this shared mood, which can be upbeat, like at a party that Heidegger talks about at the beginning, one group is upbeat, or it can be a shared downer, disgruntled, indifferent, whatever kind of mood.

715
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,961
You are in it.

716
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:25,161
And to say that it's like an atmosphere is to say that once you're in it, it colors everything that you see and do.

717
01:05:25,161 --> 01:05:31,281
And it can be, and usually is, this holistic shared kind of mood.

718
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:40,961
Consider, I mean, I take the atmosphere to point to the wholeness of it, but also to that you're not in control of it.

719
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:54,001
And once you're in it, it so much becomes the background on the basis of which you experience things and people and events that you can't even picture it some other way.

720
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:55,840
It's like the weather.

721
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:58,640
Anybody still read John Bart's book, The End of the Road?

722
01:05:58,641 --> 01:05:59,681
Probably not.

723
01:05:59,681 --> 01:06:10,881
But there's this character who's a very Heideggerian character who when he wakes up in the morning, asks himself what the weather is, which he doesn't mean whether it's raining outside.

724
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:12,561
It means what mood he's in.

725
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:16,400
And it's like the, why is it like the weather and like an atmosphere?

726
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,280
Well, it's because when you're in it, you can't even imagine what it would be like not to be in it.

727
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:24,801
So on a rainy day, it's then cold and so forth.

728
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:32,000
You just can't imagine what it would be like to be in the sun and sort of open and relaxed and enjoying the day.

729
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,520
You just can't even picture it.

730
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,801
At least that's how I am.

731
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:49,761
And when I'm in a beautiful, warm, sunny situation in which I am relaxed and open to it and enjoying it, I can't picture what it would be like to be on a closed, cold, wet day, sort of shivering and trying to get wherever I'm going as fast as I can.

732
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:51,040
Moods are like that.

733
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,080
They're like the weather.

734
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,841
They're like the atmosphere.

735
01:06:53,841 --> 01:06:56,241
They cover everything.

736
01:06:56,241 --> 01:07:01,680
And everything shows up for you on the basis of them.

737
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:04,960
And now comes the fast mood, but it's important.

738
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,120
They can be shared.

739
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,200
They often are shared.

740
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,320
Heidegger, I think, thinks they're mostly shared.

741
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:24,841
But the important thing is that they can be shared, because that's the supposed answer to why isn't art, why aren't moods just private representations in a bunch of different people's minds.

742
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:26,920
But it's, well, let me add one more sentence.

743
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,200
It's not only...

744
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,560
that they can be shared.

745
01:07:29,561 --> 01:07:31,480
That wouldn't even make the point, maybe.

746
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:36,040
I just haven't said this before ever in the course, but I've been writing about it.

747
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:51,960
It wouldn't be enough to say that they're shared, because then he could say, well, you have, we all happen to have the same representations right now, namely, let's say that it's a beautiful, comfortable day and a fascinating lecture, everybody's on the edge of their seats, and so forth.

748
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,360
So, but what's missing there?

749
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:06,600
Well, not only do you sense the mood and the weather and so forth, not only do you have a shared sense of the mood, the atmosphere and the weather, but you also share that it's shared.

750
01:08:06,601 --> 01:08:11,400
That is, you understand, and in your mood, that everybody has that mood.

751
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:14,761
That's what it would be like to be at this happy, hilarious party.

752
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:20,520
It's not only that you're happy and hilarious, but you're happy that everybody's happy and hilarious.

753
01:08:20,521 --> 01:08:27,560
This is the way it is at anything, like a wedding or a funeral or a graduation or just a successful dinner party.

754
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:32,680
The mood is shared and it's shared that it's shared.

755
01:08:32,681 --> 01:09:03,440
And that's double phenomena is what Heidegger is really interested in and thinks that if you see that that phenomena is, I keep wanting to say possible is enough for his argument, that he thinks possible and sort of primitive, that is, that's the sort of most, I don't know what to say, most revealing kind of mood is would be the most, the mood that when you're at a party, you're in the mood of the party, it's a shared mood, and moreover, it's shared that it's a shared mood.

756
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:06,080
That's the most perspicuous kind of mood.

757
01:09:06,641 --> 01:09:08,561
That's the phenomena you ought to look at.

758
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:16,801
Then you'll need to account for all the degenerate cases of people having their private moods, and everybody's happy at the party but this disgruntled guy in the corner.

759
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:18,000
And we'll worry about that.

760
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,480
Yeah.

761
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:30,240
This doesn't always seem to be the case that we're oh, I'd say good.

762
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:33,120
Well, it's not a big deal.

763
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,240
I mean, it's really just a phenomenological claim.

764
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:52,160
And when he describes what it's like to be at a party, and if he gets it right, and I'm trying to say he does and what he has in mind, you can't say, well, it looks like everybody's happy, and it looks like it's part of their happiness that they're all sharing the happiness.

765
01:09:53,441 --> 01:09:54,721
Why would you want to say that?

766
01:09:54,721 --> 01:09:56,960
I mean, that's what's happening when you describe it.

767
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,480
I mean, how could it be?

768
01:09:58,481 --> 01:10:00,960
How could what more would you want?

769
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:18,000
I mean, if you're a phenomenologist, I mean, if you're some kind of philosopher who thinks that you've got some deeper truth and that you know, like Descartes, that it couldn't really be like that, that everybody must have their own private experiences, it's all in inner sense, then you'll need some kind of argument.

770
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,440
But Heidegger wants to say, just the good old phenomenological thing.

771
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:38,240
And sort of the move, first you describe the phenomena, and then if somebody thinks that they've got some other phenomenon or some kind of argument about what kind of beings we really are to show that that phenomena couldn't happen, then you'll have to go back and worry about it.

772
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,120
But we haven't confronted that kind of argument.

773
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:53,240
We've just confronted a kind of traditional argument that was sort of implicit in Descartes, got brought out by Sartre, for instance, that everyone must have their own private world and their own private mood.

774
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,240
And Heidegger wants to say no.

775
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,200
You'll need more than just an assertion.

776
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:05,400
I'm describing the way moods are public, like atmosphere, like weather, and that's it.

777
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:06,600
Dave.

778
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,521
That's right.

779
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:18,841
That's like an atmosphere.

780
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,521
Okay, yes, I don't know whether I was going to read it or not.

781
01:11:28,521 --> 01:11:29,080
Where is it?

782
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,120
People will.

783
01:11:30,761 --> 01:11:32,280
Yes, I was going to read it.

784
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,641
But that's fine.

785
01:11:33,641 --> 01:11:35,080
And I saw another hand.

786
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:39,960
I'm sorry that this seems sort of dismissive, but I'm afraid that's the way a phenomenologist would deal with it.

787
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:40,520
Yeah.

788
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:54,120
Yes.

789
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:54,761
Well, you're right.

790
01:11:54,761 --> 01:12:00,761
He's saying, you know, if you, if you can be out of the sync with the overall mood.

791
01:12:00,761 --> 01:12:03,640
And Heidegger's going to need to tell you that.

792
01:12:03,641 --> 01:12:06,120
And he's going to tell you that, I'll just jump ahead.

793
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:14,841
Of course, he's going to say there can be breakdown cases in which the shared mood doesn't fit you and you don't fit in.

794
01:12:14,841 --> 01:12:18,680
And we'll need to talk about that too, and how that's possible.

795
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:27,400
And that's tricky because he isn't going to be able to say, well, you're just in a bad mood inside and you're projecting your bad mood on the situation.

796
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,160
That would be cheating.

797
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:37,280
He thinks that's unacceptable, unintelligible, hopelessly meaningless thing to say.

798
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,520
But then he's got to have a better thing to say.

799
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,920
And I don't think we're going to get to it today, but that's all right.

800
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,560
Yeah.

801
01:12:50,801 --> 01:12:53,841
Yeah, I think maybe neural neurons would have a lot to do with it.

802
01:12:53,841 --> 01:12:55,680
Well, let me think what I want to do.

803
01:12:55,681 --> 01:13:06,000
I think, I think, okay, let me read one more quote and then I will get to mirror neurons, but I'm in the middle of trying to do the publicness.

804
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,881
Just a second.

805
01:13:06,881 --> 01:13:10,400
Moods can be public, and moods are more basic.

806
01:13:10,401 --> 01:13:12,080
Well, I can come back to these quotes.

807
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,841
Let me say a word about that.

808
01:13:13,841 --> 01:13:20,560
I think it's very important that people can have these shared moods and share that they're shared.

809
01:13:20,561 --> 01:13:22,240
And how does that work?

810
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:33,280
Well, if you Heidegger doesn't need a neuro account, and whether the neural account turns out to be right or wrong won't destroy his phenomenology if he's got his phenomenology.

811
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:38,721
And let me see, I have to, before we're sort of, I'm trying to say too many things at once.

812
01:13:38,721 --> 01:13:45,520
You should bear in mind as you read this that moods are, and this is Heidegger's gimmick, which I'll explain a lot more next time.

813
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,000
Moods are attunements.

814
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,721
That's what he, that's the German word, it works better.

815
01:13:52,721 --> 01:14:02,160
Himung in German, which means mood, is the same word for the tuning of a musical instrument, I think.

816
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:07,601
And so moods are how you are attuned to the situation.

817
01:14:07,601 --> 01:14:12,400
You see, I guess I can't do mirror neurons until next time, because I want to sort of pull this together.

818
01:14:12,401 --> 01:14:18,360
I mean, see, if you want to say, well, if moods aren't in you, where are they?

819
01:14:18,681 --> 01:14:29,400
Well, moods are what attunes you to the situation as, say, threatening or hilarious or whatever.

820
01:14:29,881 --> 01:14:40,360
And the fact that we can sort of resonate is another word to resonate to the situation is why we all get into the same mood.

821
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,801
See, that's what I wanted to add.

822
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:49,801
How come this atmosphere at the party takes everything over and everything else being equal, unless you've just had a bad grade or gotten into some bad mood?

823
01:14:49,801 --> 01:15:00,200
Generally, that would be to have to resist your tendency to get in sync with and get in tune with and resonate to the current shared feeling.

824
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,681
Now, I will take up his thing because I've got two minutes.

825
01:15:02,841 --> 01:15:20,600
Now, it may be important that Merillo-Ponty talks about this as intercorporeality and says that it's somehow your body which is attuning you to the current mood and to all the other bodies who are attuned to the mood, and that you're all attuned to the fact that you're all attuned to the mood.

826
01:15:20,601 --> 01:15:24,520
That's all something you do by virtue of having a body, Merillo-Ponty says.

827
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:26,360
I think that's probably right.

828
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:36,841
And now, recently, people have discovered what's called mirror neurons, where in apes or some kind of, what was it, apes?

829
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:50,881
Chimpanzees, whatever, they discovered that there's neurons that they can plug into that when the, let's say, monkey sees some other monkey reaching for something.

830
01:15:50,881 --> 01:15:57,721
When he sees it, the same neurons fire that would fire if this monkey were reaching for it.

831
01:15:57,721 --> 01:16:12,721
That is, your body, your brain, when it takes up the way some other co-species being is acting, gets into that same state.

832
01:16:12,721 --> 01:16:16,881
I think the way to when I always explain it to people, it's like yawning.

833
01:16:16,881 --> 01:16:26,400
The mirror neurons are, the yawning happens to be a peculiar case in which when you see somebody else doing it, you are impelled to do it.

834
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:37,761
Now, it turns out that luckily we have a lot of inhibitions which keep us from having to, when we see somebody else eating an apple or something, we don't have to grab and eat an apple.

835
01:16:37,761 --> 01:16:42,640
But maybe our few neurons are trying and we're just trumping them.

836
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:52,560
But in general, there is the possibility that the brain can just take up something that we see and turn it into something that we do.

837
01:16:52,561 --> 01:16:54,400
Just keep thinking of yawning.

838
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:57,920
And then think how yawning can become like an atmosphere.

839
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,440
And everybody's in it.

840
01:16:59,441 --> 01:17:03,920
And you get attuned to the generally boringness of the situation.

841
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,920
And now one comment from you.

842
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,400
You learn that seeing another person smiling.

843
01:17:17,761 --> 01:17:18,080
Right.

844
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:25,040
Oh.

845
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,881
But that's interesting.

846
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:29,120
But let's let's do the smile and then we have to stop.

847
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,240
It's true, babies people knew, but they didn't know what to make of it.

848
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:38,320
Merleau-Ponty was constantly pointing out that they didn't know what to make of it, and neither did he, but he knew it was intra-corporeality.

849
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:43,040
After a baby a few hours old, if you smile at the baby, it smiles back.

850
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,680
And Piaget knew that.

851
01:17:44,401 --> 01:17:48,520
But the baby doesn't even know it's got a face and a mouth and everything.

852
01:17:48,761 --> 01:17:49,960
How does it do that?

853
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:55,801
And then it turns out if you stick your tongue out at a little baby, it sticks its tongue out back after a few hours.

854
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:59,160
And this is the kind of evidence that there are these mirror neurons.

855
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:11,801
And if you wanted to ask Heidegger how come this atmosphere happens, how come it perpetuates itself, how come it sort of regenerates itself and you share it and you share that, you share it, well, now we know a little about why that happens.

856
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:19,160
That Heidegger and Merilloponty were smart enough to see, but science hadn't told them anything about how the brain did it.

857
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:24,200
Okay, we won't go on to the understanding part because there's still plenty to say about what we saw.

858
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,561
I raised that.

859
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:26,680
Okay.
