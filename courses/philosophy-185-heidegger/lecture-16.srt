1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,920
I don't know how obvious it is to you all, but it dawns on you that there is this constantly different, described differently described threefold structure.

2
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:15,520
There is the throne, falling, projecting.

3
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:18,480
That's the most abstract version of it.

4
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,480
And we've done the thrown.

5
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:24,081
And then, and we're going to do the projecting today.

6
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:25,361
That's understanding.

7
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,521
The throne was disposedness.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,200
There's faticity, fallenness, and existence.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,160
That's Dasein's structure.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
And there is disposedness.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
I don't know what that is exactly.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,760
I think, well, Dasein experiences its structure as disposedness, falling, and understanding.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:59,361
And that's, as Heidegger says, made concrete in mood, absorbed coping, that is dealing, and what we're going to talk about today, pressing into possibilities.

14
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:04,241
I think it just helps to have these various threefold things in mind.

15
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:10,481
And rather than write them on the board, I'll make a chart and put it on the web and hand it around.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,241
But I just want you to see where we are.

17
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:24,241
And of course, I mean, it's no secret that these three are somehow going to correspond to the three aspects of time, past, present, and future.

18
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:30,640
It's no accident that there are three, and that it's those three that keep coming up and with various names.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:42,361
And so we're now doing the future part, the projecting, which is understanding, and what he calls pressing into possibilities.

20
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:49,081
All that will get clearer in the course of today's talking about it.

21
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:53,801
So it's a big struggle to get it clearer.

22
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:56,280
It took me years to get it clearer.

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:05,640
And maybe I'm even, either I may still be unclear, if so tell me, or I may be wrong that I made it clear at the expense of changing the subject or something.

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,480
But I think I finally have got it pretty straight.

25
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:27,721
The reason it seems so confused, and it does, and I used to argue with my PhD students and my TAs all the time as to what understanding really is for Heidegger, is that there are two aspects of understanding, and they're tightly related.

26
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:34,521
And I think now that one of them, we're going to call one of them basic or primary.

27
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,640
He uses, or the translator uses those two words.

28
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,121
And when we get to them, I want to know what the German is.

29
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:41,481
I didn't have time to look.

30
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:48,361
But there's something called primary or basic understanding, and then there's something called primordial understanding.

31
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:53,561
And they are very different, but they're intimately related to each other.

32
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:59,561
And at a very, a reasonably abstract level, they have the same sort of structure.

33
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:24,361
If it helps any to understand this confusion, what kind of confusion, it's similar to the confusion in the chapter on the one, where intelligibility and leveling seemed to be two opposed versions of the one, but it turned out that it's a necessary feature of intelligibility, that it's got to be general and therefore leveling.

34
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:30,080
And of course, leveling has got to be intelligible because it's something that everybody does together.

35
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:34,400
But here, at least one thing is easier.

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,320
These two kinds of understanding are in no sense opposed to each other.

37
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:51,840
It isn't as if one of them's a good guy, like intelligibility, and another one's a bad guy, like leveling, and that Heidegger flips back and forth about them within a single paragraph sometimes.

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,400
They're two good kinds of understanding.

39
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,080
They're very different.

40
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,241
They absolutely need each other.

41
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:02,241
And he goes back and forth between them all the time, everywhere.

42
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:07,040
So you've got to keep your eye on the ball when you try to do it.

43
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,760
And it's clear that, let's start on 182.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:29,041
Whatever understanding is, it's in some sense a unified phenomenon, and it's doing this important job of filling out the threefold structure on page 182.

45
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:34,320
We're now in section 31, being there is understanding.

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:50,960
And he says right off, disposedness is one of the existential structures in which the being of the there maintains itself, equiprimordial with it in constituting this being that is being in the world, really, or being the there, is understanding.

47
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:56,080
And these two are interrelated, but that's not what I want to talk about.

48
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
It'll come up a little later.

49
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,121
The state of mind always has its understanding, and understanding always has its mood.

50
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:07,841
Why that should be true is, well, why don't I tell you now?

51
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,601
I mean, because it's something I didn't get, didn't really say enough about with disposedness.

52
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:19,320
I said it, but I was half running out the door, as I recall, by the time I said it.

53
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,440
It's because of moods that things matter to us.

54
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,320
Was that obvious to you already?

55
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,721
How many understood that already?

56
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:32,440
Okay, well, I say it again, because that's the basic function.

57
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:42,040
That's what disposedness contributes, that you can't get from dealing and you can't get from understanding, whatever understanding is.

58
00:05:42,041 --> 00:06:06,041
You don't get the fact that things either attract you or frighten you or annoy you or delight you or, and to put it more relevant to what I'm going to talk about today, and Blattner is good on this in his book, mattering has to do with why you would ever have the stand you have on your take.

59
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:15,481
I mean, if the kind of, if helping people matters to you, you might well finally get yourself into the understanding of your being as being a doctor.

60
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:38,440
And if you, as I keep saying about me, if you've gotten your credit as an older sibling of taking, of explaining things and seeing the happy results of explaining things, you might end up, and that matters to you, maybe because you get love for it or because you just feel good about it.

61
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:46,041
Anyway, if that matters to you, later on on your path, you may find yourself heading toward being a teacher of some sort.

62
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:58,241
So, and that's the sense in which the disposedness is necessary for understanding, but you haven't heard, well, you'll see that now.

63
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,440
Now, I'll put that aside.

64
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:15,121
You won't understand that until you understand what understanding is for Heidegger, such that mattering is equiprimordial with it, and understanding always is tied with, has its mattering, and mattering always has its understanding.

65
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:39,761
But that's, but it's hard to understand what understanding is for Heidegger, and that's partly because I think for years I had this sort of double vision of sometimes seeing it one way and sometimes seeing it another way, and never always fighting with each other, or the TAs, as I say, and students and so forth, as to which is the right one.

66
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:52,001
Then finally, I saw sort of that both of the right ones, and only very recently, maybe even today, do I have a clear understanding of how they absolutely need each other?

67
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:58,001
There's two sides of the same, or that, well, that's to the wrong metaphor.

68
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:03,521
They make each other possible, something like that.

69
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:05,521
The two kinds of understanding.

70
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:15,281
So now we just have to look at the two kinds of understanding: the, what I'm calling basic or primary kind, and the other kind, which is the primordial kind.

71
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:18,561
And then everything, if we're lucky, will fall into place.

72
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:23,921
And then on Friday, you can come to office hours and either tell me I was right or shoot it down.

73
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:42,521
So the bottom line is, I don't want to keep it a secret because it's hard enough to see it even when you know where you're heading, is that Dasein has to take a stand on its existence by way of dealing with things and people.

74
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:46,440
And the understanding is both.

75
00:08:46,761 --> 00:09:09,561
It's that it has to take a stand on its existence, is understanding, almost upon, in English anyway, taking a stand on your existence is understanding what it is to be you, and that you can't take a stand on your existence except by dealing with things and people, and that's understanding as coping.

76
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:15,401
So there's the under, there's the understanding as coping is the basic kind of understanding.

77
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:33,561
And you have to be using lecterns and Heidegger books and blackboards and podcast microphones and so forth to deal with them skillfully in order to have a stand on your own being.

78
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:38,521
And that's, so it's not a surprise that they take it, that they belong together.

79
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:44,681
And that's what I'm so happy about that I keep repeating it in various versions.

80
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,761
Now let's see.

81
00:09:48,360 --> 00:10:07,961
Okay, so we're going to start with the primordial level, because it's sort of the primordial level that dictates and requires the basic level in a way that the basic level doesn't require the primordial level.

82
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,241
That's why the primordial level is more primordial than the basic level, I think.

83
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:18,681
That is, the primordial level is the stand that Dasein takes on its being.

84
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:23,161
That's one, that's what he calls primordial understanding.

85
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:32,960
And again, I have all these things I want to say, and maybe there's a better order, but as I have them in my mind, I want to say them, and we can always, I'll come back to them.

86
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:52,081
I never said this before until just now, and I'm listening to myself try to say why the basic is less basic, so to speak, than the primordial, or why the primordial is the most basic one, is I see now that the basic one is going to turn out to be something we share with animals.

87
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,681
And the basic one is just basically dealing successfully.

88
00:10:57,681 --> 00:11:00,161
That's going to count as understanding.

89
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:10,881
And the primordial one is our unique Daseine existence way of being, which we certainly don't in any way share with animals.

90
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,840
And that's more basic.

91
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,161
It's something like it's a richer notion.

92
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:32,480
I mean, it's you the basic one, it leaves out the crucial feature of the primordial one, namely that it's a mode of being of a very special sort of taking a stand on your being.

93
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:39,681
So now, so let's start with the more primordial one, which is going to sort of, it's going to need the basic one.

94
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:48,161
But you can understand the basic one as needed by the primordial one, but if you had only the basic one, you'd have no clue about the primordial one.

95
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:52,321
That's what I mean when I say it's a richer, it's a notion.

96
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,601
Okay, so now, let's see.

97
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,440
So at the most primordial level, we have the ultimate for the sake of which.

98
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,561
I sometimes forget to say ultimate, but let me review that too.

99
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:17,641
And then a feeling of reviewing to myself the things I understood recently that I should have understood long ago.

100
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:22,841
Remember, there are two kinds of for the sake of which which you have to st sort out here.

101
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:44,361
The for the sake of which which would share with animals like beavers building shelters, and the for the sake of which, which is the completely humankind, what it is to be you, which is a a certain, I think now, style that you have and use and and take over a role in in a certain in your own unique way.

102
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,401
Whatever.

103
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:58,200
It's the way you're going to say express what you are, but that's very bad, because it suggests that there's some deep truth about you that you're trying to express.

104
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,241
And that's kind of inner romantic view that Heidegger doesn't want.

105
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:12,761
So it isn't as if there's some, that you're trying to find your vocation as if it was something in you.

106
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:15,080
You're trying, in effect, to hear your calling.

107
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:29,241
You're trying to respond to what deeply attracts you and for which you're ready to do anything or extremely ready to die for it.

108
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:32,841
You want to be receptive to that calling.

109
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,721
That's what it is.

110
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,440
That's how you find your for the sake of.

111
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,521
Sooner or later, if you're lucky, you'll have that experience.

112
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:47,241
Now, now we better just read some stuff.

113
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,801
But I've been talking for a while.

114
00:13:51,080 --> 00:14:30,321
And so I'm going to, but I want to say one more thing because the common structure between what I'm talking about now, the ultimate for the sake of which, and the basic level of dealing that makes it possible for you to have a for the sake of which, they have a common structure that's important to Heidegger and important more for those who've had Searle, but it's because it's Heidegger going after Husserl and Descartes as usual, both at the top level, that's the primordial one.

115
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:43,921
I think of it as the top one because it's going to sort of be the final summit of all the activity that controls and organizes and coordinates all the activity if you're a teacher or a father or whatever you are or become.

116
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:50,561
So there's a common structure between that and feeling.

117
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:57,440
And that's the interesting thing that I sort of glimmered but never really saw before.

118
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:06,640
And that is the anti-Cartesian point: that it isn't, and we're going to start with the primordial one, let's start with that.

119
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:16,960
It isn't a question of having goals, which you then represent to yourself and then set out to achieve.

120
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,920
That does happen sometimes.

121
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,840
I suppose it happens lots of times.

122
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,041
You had a goal to write the paper and for the course, and you had a representation of it.

123
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:36,640
That is, you pictured yourself what the success conditions would be when you finished it and handed it in, and then that organized a lot of your activity in writing it.

124
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,000
That happens.

125
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:54,840
But there's a more basic level that Heidegger's always interested in, remember, which is just plain coping or dealing, which you have without any fancy representation of the goal, like like I take two examples from John Dewey, who understood this.

126
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,080
So getting dressed in the morning.

127
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,320
You don't need to have the goal of getting dressed to represent the success conditions.

128
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:04,920
You can be half asleep and you just are able to do it.

129
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:11,561
And this and Dewey's example are gives our examples of getting dressed and getting on and off the streetcar.

130
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:22,680
But I mean, that's the kind of familiarity and transparent, ongoing, that's another Dewey phrase, dealing with things.

131
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:29,880
And that doesn't require the representation of a goal.

132
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:31,481
I jumped ahead.

133
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:32,281
That's too bad.

134
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:35,481
That's for the organization, because I talked about Searle.

135
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,761
All I said wrong was I jumped to the basic one.

136
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,920
And I was trying to talk about the primordial one.

137
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:57,561
And since the primordial one and the basic one have this in common, they do not, at their best, require a representation of the goal.

138
00:16:57,561 --> 00:17:11,561
In fact, having a representation of the goal sort of makes them either impossible or at least or no, that's too extreme, because you did write your papers, hopefully, even though you had a representation of the goal.

139
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:34,801
It's not what's happening when you're acting in your most, I guess I'm just stuck saying basic, your most, but you could also say, remember, fluid in flow, on the familiarity, having the skill for getting around in the world, that's the bottom one.

140
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:41,601
And then there is this top one, as I'm thinking about it, which is the primordial one of having the goal.

141
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:54,400
Now I say all that because I wanted to read some things, and I'm not even sure yet, until I read them, whether they're going to turn out to be, which of these they're going to turn out to be, because they both have the structure.

142
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
Okay, let the bottom of 183.

143
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,521
I forget which it is, but we'll find out.

144
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:04,880
Understanding is the being of such, okay, uh-huh.

145
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:10,961
I never told you that potentiality for being is another big bother.

146
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,801
The German is simply seinkernen, and that should be translated ability to be.

147
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:29,441
It isn't things, it's present-at-hand things that have potentialities, like salt has the dispositional property of, or sugars that are dissolving, and so forth.

148
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:36,640
Talking about potentiality and actuality is fine for talking about present-at-hand things.

149
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,680
But this business of this ability to be is something that you're sort of enacting all the time.

150
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,561
It's not something that you could do.

151
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:54,401
If it was just a potentiality, then sometimes you'd do it and sometimes you wouldn't, but you'd always be capable of doing it.

152
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,761
It's not like that.

153
00:18:55,761 --> 00:19:00,880
It's something like it's what you do all the time insofar as you exist.

154
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,761
And c let's call that the ability to be.

155
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:21,480
So understanding is the being of such an ability to be, which is never something still outstanding as not yet present at hand, which is something which is essentially ne which which is essentially never present at hand.

156
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,400
Whoa.

157
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:24,041
Wow.

158
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,920
Not an easy thing for a dyslexic.

159
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:43,801
Understanding is the being of such ability to be, which is never something still outstanding as not yet present at hand, but which as something which is essentially never present at hand, is, with the being of Dasein in the sense of existence.

160
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:45,721
Did I read it right?

161
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:51,561
It doesn't sound exactly like English, but I understand what it means.

162
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:57,240
So remember this now, and it won't take me long to explain it, the top of 184.

163
00:19:57,241 --> 00:20:18,600
I mean, that's the very important Bill Blattner insight, that existential understanding, the stand you take on yourself in your activity, in your ability to be, is not some goal that you can aim at and achieve.

164
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,720
And remember the example, you can make your own.

165
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,120
I just always take myself as an example.

166
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
You can aim at getting tenure.

167
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,281
You can aim at teaching at Berkeley.

168
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:30,440
And you can either achieve them or not.

169
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:32,600
They are really potentialities.

170
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,000
And it's better that they become actual than if they're just possible.

171
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:47,720
Kant says somewhere, in the Critique of Pure Reason, I forget how many, but something like 10 actual dollars is much better than 10 possible dollars.

172
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:52,120
And in the world of the present at hand, that's always the case.

173
00:20:52,120 --> 00:21:00,880
The actuality, well, not always maybe, if the actuality is a bad thing, but generally, the actuality is better than the possibility.

174
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:04,640
But in this case, with the professor thing, it isn't.

175
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,721
I mean, you can get to be a professor, and then you've got it, then you have it in your past.

176
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:11,761
It was a goal, you represented the goal, all that.

177
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,880
But what's really important is being a teacher.

178
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,720
And being a teacher is something that tells you who you are.

179
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:25,920
Whereas being a professor just tells you your official role and your label, and it doesn't organize all your experience.

180
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:36,080
It doesn't sort of prioritize whether you're being a teacher is going to trump being a father when the question is whether you're going to stay with the students or go home to your kids.

181
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,320
Those are the big deal issues.

182
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:52,080
And the point Heidegger makes is that where Dasein is concerned, he says, this is what I'm trying to explain, and I never understood it until Bill explained it, that potentiality, oh no, that's not even right.

183
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,200
Possibility is his word, is higher than actuality.

184
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:07,120
Which means that unlike dollars, where actual ones are better than possible ones, actually being a professor doesn't give your life meaning and organize it.

185
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,281
But being a teacher does.

186
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,601
But being a teacher never gets actualized.

187
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,881
Remember, that's the important point.

188
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:18,721
It's not something in the future which you can represent and aim at and succeed in getting.

189
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,041
It's and what is it then?

190
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:48,840
Well, it's what organizes all of your behavior, or all of your significant behavior, not your brushing your teeth and your hand washing, maybe, but what real all the behavior that really matters to you gets coordinated and organized and so forth by this stand you take on yourself, which is this business of being something or other.

191
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,241
And now, just one more word, and then you guys can talk.

192
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:56,041
You won't see what I'm talking about if I don't say, and that's primordial understanding.

193
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:13,480
The primordial understanding is having a sense of your ability to be, your own most ability to be, which is your primordial for the sake of which, which is organizing all your significant activity.

194
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:16,120
That's primordial understanding in high degree.

195
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:20,680
See, the use of understanding is so strange that you just have to get used to it.

196
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,761
That's not what we normally talk about.

197
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:26,201
You could say, I guess, that Bert Dreykus understands himself as a teacher.

198
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:26,761
It's not.

199
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,600
What Heidegger's doing is taking among lots of different possible meanings of understand two which he wants.

200
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:40,761
And one of them is whatever it means to say Bert Dreykus understands himself as a teacher, that's primordial understanding.

201
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah, Dave.

202
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:51,000
Could you express the difference between being a professor according to possibility and the things that we might talk about?

203
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:57,320
Could you express that by saying, well, being a professor actually means being on the way according to being a profession.

204
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,880
So that we have to know it's not yet finished project.

205
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:04,121
Yes, but open.

206
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,640
I don't know.

207
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:08,281
No, I think that's very confusing.

208
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:15,400
Being a professor is getting, you know, getting it, tenure or the job or whatever it is.

209
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,241
Being on the way to being a professor is being on the way to being a professor.

210
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:25,480
But with teaching, if you're a teacher, there isn't something like getting it, and there isn't anything like being on the way to get it.

211
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,400
Well, that's good for being a teacher.

212
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:45,840
But I want to cons I mean, I want to just to make the example clear: say being a professor is what you get when you sign your contract or the day you get tenure or something.

213
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,360
I mean, there is something that you can actually achieve.

214
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,920
Now, you can be on the way to it, but being on the way to it, this is what Heidegger would say, is not as good as getting there.

215
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:03,281
I mean, so when you get your tenure and you get your office and you are a professor, that's better than being on the way to being a professor.

216
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:07,440
But there's nothing better than being on the way to being a teacher because you never can get there.

217
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:07,920
Yeah.

218
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:16,001
Yeah, I just mean once you've arrived, there's a way in which you can still talk about not having to run.

219
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,920
Maybe, but I don't.

220
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:41,840
Okay, but you're just making it mur murky because, yes, there is that, but the important thing that Heidegger wants to stress is that's not essential, and you could one day get it worked out, and then that's something in the future which is the success conditions you can aim at, just being a perfect professor.

221
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,521
When I was away, I just can't resist saying that because I'm still blown away practically to tears.

222
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:50,640
I was in the course of a perfect professor.

223
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
He just had it all together.

224
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,561
He was also a perfect teacher.

225
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:56,161
But this is, he's famous.

226
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:02,880
He teaches a course on justice, and there are a thousand students in the course and 30 TAs.

227
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,961
And every year he has new and different paper topics.

228
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:11,801
Sean and I had lunch with him after we sat in on the justice course.

229
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:14,041
And he does it all like a discussion.

230
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,561
I mean, he's now my model.

231
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,440
I mean, Michael Sandel is his name.

232
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:23,801
And he's taking immense risk because he's letting the students talk.

233
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:30,201
He doesn't let them talk the way I do, in a certain way, what we're doing maybe even better, because he asks questions.

234
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,960
But it's like a discussion section.

235
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:36,360
All thousand students with TAs all through the audience with microphones.

236
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:42,920
And he remembers the names of all of them, not from the start, but when any of them says anything, he says, what's your name?

237
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,641
And then he integrates their question with their name into the whole discussion.

238
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:49,241
What's I going to say about that?

239
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,281
Just a second.

240
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:54,361
What?

241
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,320
The perfectness of it.

242
00:26:55,481 --> 00:27:00,441
Yeah, but I was somewhere between something more about the perfectness.

243
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:01,961
Oh, yeah.

244
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:02,521
He doesn't.

245
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:10,041
He really only does it like a discussion section in the sense that he asks questions and the students answer the questions.

246
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:16,120
Oh, yeah, but no, no, the crucial thing is if you're really going to be good at anything, you've got to take a risk.

247
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,481
But you don't see it so much in me.

248
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:20,681
I'm taking a risk too.

249
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,840
I can waste your time and mine by going off on a tangent.

250
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:37,480
I was listening to the last time I gave this course, and I spent an hour discussing the difference between genuine and authentic something or other, which is in this chapter.

251
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,160
Don't ask me about it.

252
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,080
I think it's not important.

253
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:47,880
You can't even, and I regret it, and I made a fool of myself and wasted people's time.

254
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:57,120
But he's really taking a risk because his whole way of teaching depends on getting out of the students the distinction that he has in mind for that lecture.

255
00:27:57,201 --> 00:27:58,481
It was a cliffhanger.

256
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:02,561
We didn't know, Sean and I, what it was until it finally came out.

257
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:20,880
But all of his examples that he kept trying, were trying to get somebody to see, he was talking about being in the army and the difference between having a volunteer army, a conscripted army, a mercenary army, or an army where you could buy your way out like in the Civil War.

258
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:36,640
And what he wanted them to see was that there's an issue not only of people choosing, that they could be choosing for the reason that they felt it was their opportunity, a duty to the love of their country and so forth.

259
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,120
He finally got there by getting to mercenaries and what was wrong with them.

260
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,481
And some student finally said, well, they don't have any patriotism.

261
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:45,681
And then he had it.

262
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,041
But it was about five minutes before the end of his hour was up.

263
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,801
And that was the whole point of the lecture.

264
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:53,840
I said, well, what would happen, Michael, if they just didn't say it?

265
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,400
And he said, well, that's just a risk you have to take.

266
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,320
We'll bring it back up in the blog.

267
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
There's a blog that goes with the course.

268
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,761
It so worked out.

269
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:03,041
Why am I telling you all this?

270
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:03,440
I don't know.

271
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:06,080
It's just something so important to me.

272
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,680
I just saw what it is to be a perfect teacher.

273
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,201
And he's not stopping with this.

274
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:14,880
I mean, he's already exploring webcasts, and he's already exploring.

275
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:24,161
He wants to see if he can use interactive video in his webcast, because he can't teach if he isn't constantly interacting with the students who are also taking risks.

276
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,201
Because there they are.

277
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:35,120
I'm amazed at how courageous they are, saying what they think the answer to the questions are with a thousand students looking at them and wondering whether they're going to make any sense.

278
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,681
But that's teaching.

279
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,000
That's wonderful.

280
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,840
And that's the skill.

281
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,041
I've just transitioned without meaning to.

282
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:55,320
Teaching is his primordial ultimate for the sake of which.

283
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:04,680
And to do it, he needs lots of equipment and lots of skill and the risk, but I won't go into that because Heidegger doesn't go into that.

284
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:12,360
But he needs that he is able to organize all this equipment to do it.

285
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,120
That means that that's the other kind of understanding.

286
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:31,080
He has to have the skill for coping with 30 TAs with microphones running around and he uses overhead projector because he has to write on the blackboard, but he can't write on the blackboard in a room for a thousand people.

287
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,401
But he's got the way of doing it by using the old technology.

288
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,241
He hates PowerPoint, I was happy to see, because he kind of has to.

289
00:30:39,561 --> 00:30:42,840
PowerPoint puts you into sort of locked step.

290
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,721
The teacher knows already how it's going to turn out.

291
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:50,120
No risk at all, and no interest really, and no excitement at all.

292
00:30:50,120 --> 00:31:06,840
Whereas he's writing down, keeping track of who said what, and he's going to finally, in the last five minutes, if he's lucky, or maybe ten if he's luckier, put it all together so that you can see the difference between, say, Locke and Rousseau, which is one of the things that was the point of that lecture.

293
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,961
Did I see a hand up?

294
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:08,440
Yeah.

295
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:17,561
Well, well, that that then then don't say it.

296
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:20,761
That is, I mean, that's not a Heideggerian thing.

297
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:29,840
If you it's the kind of teacher that that we're interested in being, you could be without being accredited, and being accredited wouldn't really make you a teacher.

298
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:42,880
I mean, being accredited is another thing in the future which you can achieve and which you can represent what it would be like when you get it, and you can then, so to speak, sort of rest on your laurels if you want to.

299
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,640
That's not what I'm talking about.

300
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,920
That's being a professor, or being an instructor, or being whatever you just got to, when you got to.

301
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:01,920
I'm talking about something which nothing like accrediting or tenure or whatever could give you.

302
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,761
It's a way of life.

303
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,440
It's what your life means.

304
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:08,161
What you think you are.

305
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,841
And there's this passage I'll read where Heidegger's underlining is all the time.

306
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:15,680
You're primordial for the sake of is what you are.

307
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:23,361
And to say that, well, I'm an accredited professor, that doesn't sound like a life ambition or a way or something.

308
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:30,721
No, but you could say, I'm a teacher, or I am sort of the village explainer, then you've got a way of life.

309
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,280
Yes.

310
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,521
Oh.

311
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
It's a terrible story.

312
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:03,040
It's a disaster.

313
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,721
What happened to you described it?

314
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:05,520
Okay.

315
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:08,320
Yes, well that's that's that's interesting.

316
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:13,481
I in fact, five houses down the street from where I live, there was a guy like that.

317
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:15,001
He was training to be an astronaut.

318
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:16,280
He was going to be an astronaut.

319
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:17,080
He understood everything.

320
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:22,841
He was a professor of astronomy, but he was also doing all the exercises.

321
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:25,400
And just before he was supposed to go, he got cancer.

322
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:29,481
He got cured, but then it was too late to go, and they never let him go.

323
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:32,360
And he was, but I know a more dramatic one.

324
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:40,841
A woman who took the Marilla-Ponty course, I think maybe it was three years ago, who had been training, I guess she was probably three or four years old, to be a ballet dancer.

325
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:47,881
And then she got somehow something like, I don't know, arthritis or something, where it was just too painful for her to do.

326
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:58,681
And why I'm telling you this is because both of them, at least I know about her, I'm assuming, I didn't talk to the astronaut guy about it, but I take it they would both go into grief.

327
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:07,961
And by grief, I mean the whole meaning of their world would collapse along with the meaning of their life, just as if somebody you love died.

328
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:18,680
And it would be just exactly the other side proof that this had been their defining ultimate for the sake of which.

329
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,241
And when you lose it, you lose everything.

330
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,161
Significance disappears.

331
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:33,001
I presume for people like that, the world is the disposingness is kind of gray, and nothing really looks like it's worth doing and really matters.

332
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:35,401
But it doesn't have to be the end of the world.

333
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:40,600
After you go through grief, you can get a new ultimate for the sake of which.

334
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,880
But you're onto a very interesting phenomenon, yeah.

335
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:50,041
How did you understand grief without going to the motion by the Berlin Period?

336
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:53,080
Ah, how can you well that's a good question.

337
00:34:53,080 --> 00:35:04,241
How can you uh you it is a failing of a certain way of being, but it's not uh some goal that they aimed at which they didn't get.

338
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,281
It's a kind of significance that they lived in, which they have now lost.

339
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,400
It was a question it's very interesting.

340
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,080
There's a difference between failing to achieve something and world collapse.

341
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:26,080
World collapse is a very more ontological condition that goes with primordial for the sake of witches.

342
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,521
Anything else?

343
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:28,561
Good examples.

344
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:29,120
Yeah.

345
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:36,080
It's also very good as a father.

346
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,761
How do you say that I involved in silent or infamous and everything more by imaginary?

347
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:44,320
Yes, well, that's a very tough one.

348
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,600
How would you reconcile the primordial for the sake of which of being a teacher and being a father?

349
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,041
I've always wondered.

350
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,080
I don't feel I did it right, but I don't know what it is to do it right.

351
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:02,561
I mean, I sort of sacrificed being with my kids a lot of the time to teaching a lot more of the time.

352
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:12,720
But what would be ideal would be somehow to get them together in a more, as you say, for the sake of which that somehow brought them together.

353
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,680
In a way, I did.

354
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,520
My kids always say, well, you related to us as a teacher.

355
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:24,480
You always listened to us and then tried to see what we were saying and then tried to point us further in whatever direction and so forth.

356
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,641
I guess I sort of did it.

357
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:29,280
But anyway, it is a problem.

358
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,920
It's a problem that Heidegger just doesn't even broach because he's being so ontological.

359
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:40,521
But if you ask sort of the existential question, what if you have two primordial for the sake of witches?

360
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,120
How do you get, what do you do about that?

361
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:57,721
Then I think Heidegger has to say, well, either you rank them and you can tell when the chips are down, which one you'll sacrifice, or half of it, if you can do it, you make a more basic one that combines them.

362
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,960
But that's this is all existential, of course, but that doesn't matter.

363
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:10,520
I mean, it's important to help you understand the ontological, and it's something you could certainly talk about in a paper if you want to.

364
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,401
And go ahead, yeah, Curtis.

365
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,961
I just kind of touched on the fourth thing.

366
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:23,481
That's the structure of the world.

367
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,001
He doesn't have a sick wish to reexist.

368
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:33,801
And we don't want to get that muddled up with the optical notion of being a teacher and being a father.

369
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,280
The for the sake of which is a more abstract notion.

370
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,641
We live for the sake of being a teacher and a father.

371
00:37:40,280 --> 00:38:04,521
Well, well, I don't find that very illuminating, but maybe it is because I think you better be, I mean, it's not maybe for us to discuss, but there is a real question, an existential question, maybe you're not disagreeing, of how you get together being a teacher and a father.

372
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:11,720
You can't just say, well, you know, you just do it, you become a teacher/slash/father, bong, there's your for the sake of which.

373
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,680
I mean, I always want to stay close to the phenomena.

374
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,320
And they're onto the phenomena.

375
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:22,480
What if you lose your ability to X, like be a ballet dancer?

376
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:24,361
Or how do you reconcile the two?

377
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:35,281
Those aren't Heidegger's questions, because at the level he's talking, you make it sound as if his ontological level somehow solves the problem of the existential level.

378
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,840
Not a professor, a teacher.

379
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:44,641
A teacher.

380
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:46,240
Just don't confuse yourself.

381
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,120
Yeah, okay.

382
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,721
You sent like an example with the astronaut that breaks his leg and doesn't want to go in space.

383
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,720
He's not that kind of style to be the type of person that wants to be an astronaut.

384
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,921
I'm serving bracelets.

385
00:38:57,921 --> 00:38:59,360
He's going to be on another mission.

386
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:00,320
Something like that.

387
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:07,440
Maybe it's not going to go to space, but it's that style of his way.

388
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:08,080
Okay, good.

389
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,521
I think I see what you're saying now.

390
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:10,401
I think that's right, too.

391
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:15,360
Well, it's this style business is the mattering part of it, I take it.

392
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:19,841
What matters to him is, so to speak, stuff that has to do with faith.

393
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:30,241
And that's another way he could save himself from grief, would be to just switch the fact that what really matters and makes his life worth living is space things.

394
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,160
And that's what he did do.

395
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:41,761
He stays a kind of scientific consultant to NASA, and he's very involved in the keeping track of things on missions and stuff.

396
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,880
That's fine.

397
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:56,401
And what Curtis is saying is right, as long as you don't think that the primordial for the sake of which is something else more abstract than whatever it is that concretely gives meaning to your life.

398
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,400
But finally, it has to, so to speak, be some specific for the sake of which.

399
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:08,001
And it better not be, and this is important from previous years, Curtis and I had discussed this.

400
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:16,360
There is this risk, which isn't, this is a funny place to discuss it, but I think maybe we did when we talked about the for the sake of which last time.

401
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:17,641
I don't, I'm not sure.

402
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,881
But there are two, I think, mistaken ways to deal with it.

403
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:34,521
One is to think that, well, you're for the sake of which is just to be you, so to speak, which seems trivial and hard to see how that could give any kind of coherent meaning to your activities.

404
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:38,521
And the other one is that you just take on a role.

405
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:46,120
And that doesn't sound like it's enough specificity if everybody is just able to take on the same role.

406
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,201
Now, I want to make parenthetically, because it's important, a lot of people are like that.

407
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:58,921
They just have a ones, everybody has their primordial for the sake of which, but it could be just a general role.

408
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:02,600
They're sort of acting out this business or that.

409
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:15,480
It isn't, but if you're doing it, so to speak, authentically or right, then you've got to bring in somehow the individual uniqueness of it and the role stuff.

410
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:20,201
Because if you just go around being uniquely yourself, I don't think that'll do it.

411
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:29,720
And if you just go around filling out the role of teacher, perhaps as you've seen in movies and T V, what one does when one is a teacher, that's not going to do it.

412
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,760
So what's it got to be?

413
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Well, it's got to be doing something that's got a role in the culture.

414
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,400
I mean, otherwise you'd just be crazy from your point of view and from everybody else's.

415
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:49,161
Doing something that has a r a role in the culture, but not in a general, vain level, standard way, but in your own unique style.

416
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:59,120
So that you have to put together the sort of what I call think of it again as the romantic view that there's some deep you, that you've just gotta just being you is a is all you have to do.

417
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:03,681
You've gotta do it through the shared pro shared roles.

418
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,481
But it's inauthentic if you just think that you're taking on a role.

419
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:15,360
You've got to do it with the style that represent uh that is your way of distributing your efforts and your mattering.

420
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:17,760
I don't know, do we don't we agree about that finally?

421
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,080
Okay, good.

422
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,521
Finally, after three or four years we we influence me, I influenced him.

423
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:26,161
Yeah.

424
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,641
Well, I can't hear you loud enough.

425
00:42:33,441 --> 00:43:00,641
You're deliberately recognizing pilots and you're getting that for that and look at it and having a positive effect in the order of the society, but well, I I think that's probably an interesting question, but I don't answer it simply because we're just staying at the existential level, and now it's time to go on.

426
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,201
You are all telling me specific problems with For the Sake of Witches, and he's asking about whether you could sacrifice yours.

427
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:20,160
I was just reading a tale of two cities where some where somebody has that, where Sidney Carton, I guess, I haven't got to the end that I've heard, sacrifices himself and something, but he does it presumably.

428
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:24,561
I take it because that's his understanding of being.

429
00:43:24,881 --> 00:43:25,441
Never mind.

430
00:43:25,441 --> 00:43:32,481
I don't know how his understanding of being can't just require him to sacrifice his understanding of being.

431
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:34,641
He'd be out in nowhere.

432
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,200
So too hard.

433
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,160
Come and talk in office.

434
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,720
It's too existential.

435
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:41,561
Limit, let's go on.

436
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:42,360
Okay?

437
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,960
Where do you get it going?

438
00:43:44,441 --> 00:44:05,960
We're about to read 183 at the bottom, which we just did, I think, which is, yes, okay, now do you hope, after all that discussion, and it's worth it, to understand something that's very interesting, and nobody except Bill Blattner, as far as I know, has ever understood it and made a fuss about it, but it's crucial.

439
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:28,361
Understanding is the being of such ability to be, which is never something still outstanding, that is something which you're going to achieve in the future but haven't yet, as it isn't outstanding, it's not yet present at hand, but which as something which is essentially never present at hand, is with the being of Dasein in the sense of existence.

440
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:30,041
You should understand that now.

441
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:37,880
That it is, it's what you are, and will continue to be, but it's not something that you could achieve.

442
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:39,080
That's what we've been saying.

443
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,281
That's what he's saying.

444
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,640
So let's go on.

445
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:45,481
Let's see, 184.

446
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,040
Oh, I say just go on reading.

447
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:51,080
Okay, Dasein is such at the top of 184.

448
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,961
The German is 144 middle.

449
00:44:53,961 --> 00:45:01,801
Dasein is such that in every case it's understood or alternately not understood that it is to be such thus and thus.

450
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,001
As such understanding, it knows what it's capable of.

451
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:11,321
That is, well, then its potentiality for being is capable of doesn't make any sense.

452
00:45:11,481 --> 00:45:15,161
It knows what it is capable of, that is, what it can be.

453
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,401
I think that's what the German said.

454
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:22,440
This knowing does not first arise from an imminent self-perception.

455
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:28,640
That's the sort of romantic thing again, that you've got, all you have to do is sort of look inside to find out what you're calling is.

456
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:31,760
That belongs to the being of the there, which is essentially understanding.

457
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,080
Only because Dasein, in understanding, is its there, can it go astray and fail to recognize it.

458
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,880
So I don't think I need to read any more of this, does I?

459
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,481
No, no.

460
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:44,561
But he's talking about inauthentic there.

461
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:48,240
I mean, how Dasein can sort of fall into some role, or I think.

462
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,681
But I'm not sure what he's talking about there, but we don't need it.

463
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:59,201
So, and now, I mean, I've just been sort of flipping back and forth like Heidegger, because they're so intimately related.

464
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:13,921
But mostly we've been talking about the primordial for the kind of understanding, which is, namely, having your own ultimate for the sake of which.

465
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:26,881
Now we're going to switch to talking about what I'm calling the basic level, and that's that you're day-to-day skillful, transparent, hoping, dealing with equipment.

466
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:38,561
And that's a kind of understanding that makes this other kind of understanding, namely the for the sake of, final, for the sake of which, is organizing all the time.

467
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:43,120
So now on 184, go down to the italics.

468
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:57,521
Understanding is the existential being of Dasein's own most ability to be, and it is so in such a way that this being discloses itself, it discloses in itself what its being is capable of.

469
00:46:57,521 --> 00:47:01,120
Ah, no, I'm sorry, I just misled you.

470
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,080
That's still about the primordial for the sake of, its own most ability to be.

471
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,440
That's not your ability to open doors and lecterns.

472
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,561
So now, so what do I want next?

473
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,401
Let's try.

474
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,441
Let me not make this mistake the next time.

475
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,401
Well, that belongs with the primordial.

476
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:25,401
Maybe it's going to happen next.

477
00:47:25,401 --> 00:47:26,680
Okay, now let's see.

478
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,001
I want to look ahead.

479
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:34,040
Yeah, he's going to, you see, this is what's so confusing.

480
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:39,721
He's going to, if you just keep reading, you find yourself in the coping with equipment world.

481
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,440
Let's go on.

482
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:45,240
As a disclosure, understanding always pertains to the whole basic state of being in the world.

483
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,561
As a potentiality for being, any being in is an ability to be in the world.

484
00:47:51,561 --> 00:48:12,201
Not only is the world qua world disclosed as possible significance, now see, we're in the coping business, as possible significance, but when that which is within the world is itself freed, and we don't go back over that again, but you have a feel for that, I hope, this entity is freed for its own possibilities.

485
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,080
That which is ready to hand is discovered.

486
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,401
And now this is a different kind of understanding.

487
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:18,200
Absolutely.

488
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:25,641
This is that which is ready to hand is discovered as such in its serviceability, usability, its detrimentality.

489
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,201
The totality of involvements is revealed.

490
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:47,160
Sort of imperceptibly, we've gone from the, and no wonder it's hard to understand, the kind of understanding that comes from taking a stand on your own being to the kind of coping with the serviceable and usable and so forth that you have to do in order to take a stand.

491
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:57,120
We've now got to the serviceability of lecterns and books and pens and so forth, which is very different than this business we've been discussing of being a teacher.

492
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,841
And he's talking about both.

493
00:48:59,841 --> 00:49:10,881
And the crunch, I mean, the sentence which I never paid much attention to, I now think is crucial, is the top of 185, and that's about the middle of 145.

494
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:14,721
With equipment, I'm really doing this, the equiprimordial bit.

495
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:30,161
With equiprimordial primordiality, the understanding projects Dasein's being both upon its, for the sake of which, that's the ultimate for the sake of which, and upon significance as the worldhood of its current world.

496
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:40,641
That's the whole referential totality, plus the roles that is that teaching equipment and teaching world.

497
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,201
All of that you've got to have if you're going to be a teacher.

498
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,801
And that's equiprimordial, these two kinds of understanding.

499
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:52,481
I take it really to be equiprimordial means that you can say in either way that they're each basic.

500
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:58,801
I mean, the primordial one is basic since it selects which of the significance structure you're going to use.

501
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:06,881
I'm going to use this, not baseballs and baseball bats and mitts and so forth, to take my stand on my being.

502
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:11,361
That's the way the primordial one organizes everything.

503
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:14,320
But the basic one is equiprimordial.

504
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:25,120
It's equally absolutely necessary because you can't just sit at home and smoke a pipe and think that you're a teacher.

505
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,600
You've got to have the equipment to do it.

506
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,640
Okay, now I've gotten close to where I want to be.

507
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,280
Let's see.

508
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,600
One, two, three.

509
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,281
Yeah, okay.

510
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,840
There's plenty more to say.

511
00:50:52,841 --> 00:51:01,880
But this is, you see, I hope now the basic point, why it hangs together, these two kinds of understanding, and why it's hard.

512
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:02,521
Oh, yeah.

513
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:14,521
Now, I spent a lot of time already, and I don't regret it for a minute, on the kind of understanding that's involved in having, taking a stand on your being.

514
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:20,600
And keep remembering that kind of punt, because it's very, I mean, it helps you get a sense.

515
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,041
And remember the phrase, well, he understands himself as a teacher.

516
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:26,041
We've been talking about that understanding.

517
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:33,001
Now, there's a lot more to say about the basic understanding, which is the coping kind.

518
00:51:33,401 --> 00:51:46,521
I'm always happy and interested because I think Heidegger is so ahead of his time and so ahead of everybody else in his understanding of this coping business that I pay careful attention.

519
00:51:46,521 --> 00:52:01,961
And now I want to say that, and this is, it's obvious that understanding has a meaning which is going to lead you astray and cover up the phenomena that he wants you to see.

520
00:52:01,961 --> 00:52:05,881
Because understanding is usually taken to be an intellectual sort of thing.

521
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:10,201
It takes thinking to understand, one would suppose.

522
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:15,801
You can't be understanding when you're just hitting a ball back with a slam from the net.

523
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,401
Well, in Heidegger's sense, that's understanding.

524
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:21,801
Understanding is know-how.

525
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,441
And it's not cognitive.

526
00:52:25,441 --> 00:52:26,400
It's not thinking.

527
00:52:26,401 --> 00:52:28,240
I mean, he's got other words for that.

528
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:30,880
You've got to get used to his vocabulary.

529
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:40,241
When you start paying attention and thinking and solving a problem and puzzling because things aren't going in the flowing sort of way, that's called interpretation.

530
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,401
And that's on the agenda for next Tuesday in the assignment.

531
00:52:44,401 --> 00:52:54,880
And understanding is for Heidegger this fluid kind of coping, and he's explicit about it here way back on 385.

532
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:56,721
I find it where I can.

533
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:03,041
In Division II, all of these things we're talking about come back and they get mapped onto temporality.

534
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:05,120
But I don't care about that right now.

535
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:15,600
I just want you to see right at the top of German 336 on your 385, section A, there's just a sentence which is important.

536
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:40,080
With the term understanding, we have in mind a fundamental existentiale, which is neither a definite species of cognition, I'll tell you about that in a minute, distinguished, let us say, from explaining and conceiving, nor any cognition at all in the sense of grasping something thematically, which that means paying attention to something and dealing with it by thinking about it, reflecting on it, noticing it.

537
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:45,681
All of that is not the kind of understanding, the deep kind, the basic kind.

538
00:53:45,680 --> 00:54:07,120
Remember always, or keep getting used to the fact that a sports person doing a brilliant move is showing understanding, that a musician doing a brilliant thing is understanding, but then you're managing just to get out the door and responding to the two go out at the appropriate time in the appropriate way is a kind of understanding.

539
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:19,641
That's and now, parenthetically, I have to say that he's also making a point about two species of cognition.

540
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,441
And this is only going to confuse the Germans more than it's going to confuse us.

541
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:25,561
But it's interesting.

542
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:37,881
At his time, philosophers were interested in the difference between explaining and understanding, Erklaren and Versteien in German.

543
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:41,161
And Versteien is the word for understanding that he's got.

544
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,761
And he wants to say, no, I'm not talking about the Ferstein half of what you guys talk about.

545
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:59,641
The Ferstein people, the understanding people among his contemporaries, were interested in the fact that if you do history, you have to understand what's going on in terms of what it means to the people.

546
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,600
But if you do science, then you bring things under universal laws.

547
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,801
Understanding was the social sciences.

548
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:11,801
It was the Geistus Wittgenstaft in German jargon.

549
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,840
And Erkleen is the Naturwissenschaft.

550
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:16,441
That's natural science.

551
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:21,721
And he's saying, but both of them are a kind of thinking.

552
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:33,801
There's the social science kind of thinking, which is understanding, and the natural science kind of thinking, which is bringing things under laws, scientific laws.

553
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,401
That's explaining.

554
00:55:35,401 --> 00:55:37,721
And he's not talking about either of them.

555
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,160
He's talking about something different and more basic.

556
00:55:41,401 --> 00:55:45,321
That's why he says it's not a species of cognition.

557
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:52,440
And it as as understanding versus explaining, it's not any kind of cognition at all.

558
00:55:52,441 --> 00:55:54,600
It's not thinking at all.

559
00:55:54,921 --> 00:55:58,561
And then now you might think, wow, that's pretty strange.

560
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:00,001
What could he be talking about?

561
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:10,481
But I hope you've been paying attention enough to know after all the time that I talked about skillful coping, that what he's talking about is skillful coping.

562
00:56:10,481 --> 00:56:17,361
And that's what he's going to call basic understanding.

563
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:21,201
So on 182, we're back to that again.

564
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,241
Something there.

565
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:22,640
Okay.

566
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,600
Oh, it's the same thing.

567
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:25,041
Now it's in your reading.

568
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:27,281
The very middle of 182.

569
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:32,561
And there's we're going to find me hit the German there.

570
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:33,600
So I be careful.

571
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,241
We're at the top of 143.

572
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:42,001
And there is the primary, which I didn't have time to look up, but I think it's going to be different than primordial.

573
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:42,961
It better be.

574
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:49,920
But I want to read starting right after where we were: understanding always has its mood.

575
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:58,321
If we interpret understanding as a fundamental existentiale, this indicates that this phenomenon is conceived as a basic mode of Dasein's being.

576
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,001
On the other hand, understanding in the sense of one possible kind of cognizing, that's the same point again.

577
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:05,521
That's the social science of stuff.

578
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,641
It's going to confuse you if we don't ignore it.

579
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:26,641
Understanding in the sense of one possible kind of cognizing among others, as distinguished, for instance, from explaining, must, like explaining, be interpreted as an existential derivative of that primary understanding, which is what he's going to talk about, which is one of the constituents of the being of the there in general.

580
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,880
Ah, what does it say for primary?

581
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,561
The primer.

582
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:34,400
And what's the word for primordial?

583
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:36,481
That's, I used to know.

584
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:39,521
Well, Urspunglich, yes, a big difference.

585
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:40,000
Right.

586
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:42,200
Okay, so we've got it, and so I'm happy to see.

587
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:47,001
I'm going to translate primary there in my terms as basic.

588
00:57:47,640 --> 00:58:03,401
Primary is, I think, okay too, and make clear that that's totally different than, obviously, obviously, totally different than the primordial understanding, which is supposed to be the way Dasein takes a stand on its being.

589
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:05,721
So we now got them sorted out.

590
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,080
That's a big step forward.

591
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:17,881
Now, notice, though, how confusing it is, because immediately he goes back to primordial understanding from primary.

592
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:25,241
Took me, you know, take 20 years of reading it and getting confused to finally see that something important is happening there.

593
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,481
We have, after all, already come up against this primordial understanding.

594
00:58:29,481 --> 00:58:36,600
I don't know, it's so confusing because we back, well, maybe this primordial understanding in our previous investigations.

595
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,881
Is the German Urspunglich there?

596
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:42,281
Or did the translators mess up?

597
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:44,440
Geischbunglich.

598
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,200
Well, that's very confusing.

599
00:58:46,760 --> 00:59:02,600
Now I don't know what to do, except, I mean, till I collect my wits or somebody comes and tells me, it looks like Heidegger's not making a distinction between primary understanding, which he'd better be making, because he goes right on now, he uses the word primordial.

600
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:12,600
We have already come up, let's read what he's going to say, come up against this primordial understanding in our previous investigations, though we didn't allow it to be included explicitly in the theme of the discussion.

601
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,481
To say that existing Dasein is it's there, is equivalent, and so forth and so forth.

602
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:20,041
And now he's switching back.

603
00:59:20,361 --> 00:59:23,800
He really, it's the this primordial.

604
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,521
Let's look at the German again.

605
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:29,281
Is it this, is he saying this primordial or just primordial?

606
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:31,041
This.

607
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,360
Okay, yeah, we got a German reader here.

608
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,600
Well, so much the worse for Heidegger.

609
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:38,481
Are you going to say good Greek in the margin?

610
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:41,201
That's what you say when you find things like that.

611
00:59:41,521 --> 00:59:48,400
Because, I mean, I can make perfectly good sense of it, provided that we understand that he's now switched to primordial.

612
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:50,241
It's the this that is the problem.

613
00:59:50,240 --> 01:00:09,280
Because now he says, having done primary understanding, he's switched over, you look a little further down, where he says, to say that an existing Dasein is its there is equivalent to saying that the world is there, Dasein's being there and being in, and the latter being in, or no, or is that Dasein?

614
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,961
Dasein, I guess, is what's the latter?

615
01:00:18,001 --> 01:00:20,080
It being there is being in.

616
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,240
Dasein's being there is being in.

617
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:28,080
And Daseine is likewise there as that for the sake of which Dasein is.

618
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,321
That's the ultimate for the sake of which.

619
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:39,760
In, and now you see we've switched without any, not only doesn't he signal it, I mean, I'm now feeling vindicated for being confused all these years.

620
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:55,760
Not only does he doesn't, not only, he doesn't, not only does he not tell you that he's changed the subject between paragraphs and gone off onto a discussion of explaining and stuff, which I'll talk in a minute, but he even messes up by saying that it's primordial.

621
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,401
But now look, he got to primordial.

622
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,760
Look what he says next.

623
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:05,441
In the for the sake of which existing being in the world is disclosed as such, and this disclosed we called understanding.

624
01:01:05,441 --> 01:01:07,040
Yeah, primordial understanding.

625
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:12,200
In the understanding of the for the sake of which, the significance which is grounded therein is disclosed along with it.

626
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,600
Good.

627
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:16,760
Now we're back at the other kind of understanding again, the referential whole.

628
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:21,561
See, they are so intimately related that I don't, but I want to distinguish them.

629
01:01:21,561 --> 01:01:22,760
I'll let you talk in just a second.

630
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,201
Let me finish the paragraph.

631
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,920
The disclosure of understanding is discloseness of the for the sake of which and of significance.

632
01:01:28,921 --> 01:01:31,881
We're preparing for getting them together now.

633
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:37,321
And of significance, equiprimordially, pertains to the entirety of being in the world.

634
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:41,080
Significance is that on the basis of which the world is disclosed as such.

635
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:50,120
To say that the for the sake of which and significance are both disclosed in Dasein means that Dasein is that entity which is being in the world is an issue for it.

636
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,561
Well, you see what I mean?

637
01:01:51,561 --> 01:01:55,001
The two things are being juggled together.

638
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:58,201
They belong together, but they're so different.

639
01:01:59,321 --> 01:02:00,360
Are you following me?

640
01:02:00,361 --> 01:02:03,640
I think so, but I have the feeling of people looking blank.

641
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,240
I mean, so I keep repeating.

642
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:20,120
The primordial understanding of taking a stand on your being and the everyday basic understanding of know-how are utterly different and yet intimately related.

643
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:20,520
Yeah.

644
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:27,721
That's right.

645
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,001
That's just what I said, by the way.

646
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:31,800
But good, I'm ready.

647
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:38,600
Excuse me, primordial understanding.

648
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,161
Yeah.

649
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:41,800
Okay.

650
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,201
No, he's really well that he's yes, they're equiprimordial.

651
01:02:46,841 --> 01:02:54,440
One is direct Derek Dazzle and being upon the for the big witici which and the other is Jeff and Dazzler and being upon the being in the world, isn't it?

652
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,321
Yes.

653
01:02:57,521 --> 01:03:04,481
Okay, but but there are two, but for just a second, the interesting thing is that he's sort of justified in what he's doing.

654
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:08,801
I mean, there are these two separate meanings of understanding, totally different.

655
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:27,201
One of them is something like he understands uh English or he uh I don't know understands baseball or something where it doesn't where it means that he's he knows how to do it and it doesn't have anything to do with his my for the sake of which that I understand English.

656
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,721
And there and there are these two basic things.

657
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,481
Well I guess I just tried on me.

658
01:03:32,481 --> 01:03:33,921
He understands teaching.

659
01:03:33,921 --> 01:03:35,041
That's fine.

660
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,480
He understands English.

661
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:37,681
That's fine.

662
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:39,680
No, no, sorry, that's that's just confusing.

663
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,001
Forget it.

664
01:03:40,001 --> 01:03:40,640
Sorry to get it.

665
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,041
He understands himself as a teacher.

666
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:44,080
That's fine.

667
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,001
One use of understanding.

668
01:03:46,321 --> 01:03:48,160
He understands how to teach.

669
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,080
He has the know-how for teaching.

670
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,841
That's a very different kind.

671
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:53,120
Very different kind.

672
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,040
And yet you can have one without the other.

673
01:03:55,041 --> 01:04:02,801
You have to when you understand yourself as a teacher, you can only do it if you have the know-how to use the equipment for teachers.

674
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,680
Okay, now Dave.

675
01:04:15,521 --> 01:04:18,161
I wish it were so, but I don't think it is.

676
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:29,441
Well, then it's something that they're the deep projection background possibilities which then become relevant and so forth.

677
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:33,681
Well, both of them have to identify at the same time.

678
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,041
You have to vary the same thing.

679
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:37,160
Okay, but I think that isn't right.

680
01:04:37,401 --> 01:04:41,160
Only because it doesn't fit the phenomenon he's describing.

681
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,361
Or at least let me try to see if it fits it.

682
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:54,361
The crucial is the background, which is what David is suggesting, a kind of know-how?

683
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:55,800
Yes, it certainly is.

684
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:00,441
It's a kind of know-how for finding your way around in the world, and that's very right.

685
01:05:00,441 --> 01:05:05,880
But he's using understanding in a broader way than the background know-how for finding your way around in the world.

686
01:05:05,881 --> 01:05:12,600
As I say, it fits his story to use understanding like he understands English or and so forth.

687
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,720
Let me read quotes, and then we'll see if what David said is going to work or not.

688
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:23,400
I wish it would, and maybe it does, but I'm not sure until I look.

689
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:29,080
So in my commentary, which is now what I'm looking at, I've got quotes.

690
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,520
You don't need the commentary.

691
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,921
It's just easy for me to carry around, easier than the whole book.

692
01:05:34,921 --> 01:05:48,041
So in the history of the concept of time, on 298, he says, in a wonderful sort of like an analytic philosopher, and remember, logic was his big field when he came into this.

693
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:52,200
In ordinary language, we say he understands how to handle men.

694
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,521
Oh, that's his okay, there's his example.

695
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:59,960
Now, see, that doesn't that's sort of background, but that seems sort of more specific.

696
01:05:59,961 --> 01:06:01,400
He understands how to handle men.

697
01:06:01,401 --> 01:06:03,001
He knows how to talk.

698
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:05,961
Understanding here means knowing how.

699
01:06:05,961 --> 01:06:07,481
The German is kernen.

700
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:12,120
I don't think any German means really knowing how, but that's certainly, the best attempt.

701
01:06:12,121 --> 01:06:14,760
And so then the translator helps him out.

702
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,760
It means knowing how, being capable of.

703
01:06:20,121 --> 01:06:31,760
See, Kernen probably really means being capable of, and that's sort of misleading because you could be capable of murdering your best friend or something, but that didn't be a kind of know-how.

704
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:35,521
But anyway, that's one of the quotes.

705
01:06:35,521 --> 01:06:37,361
And now here's the best quote.

706
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:47,600
If any of you ever have any doubts about what he means by understanding, and at least want to keep your eye on the phenomenon, look at Basic Problems 276.

707
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,600
I'm going to read the passage.

708
01:06:49,600 --> 01:07:02,960
I have to tell you beforehand, I used to think it was a perfect example of what I thought understanding meant in Heidegger, until I realized that the translator had read what I thought and put it into the Heidegger.

709
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:09,920
So now I have to sort of warn you as I read it that it isn't quite as Dridgerian as one would have hoped.

710
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,200
So here we go.

711
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,441
In German, we say that someone can forestand something.

712
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:26,880
And then the translator says, and this is okay, literally stand in front of it, ahead of it, administer it, manage it, provide, preside over it.

713
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,680
This is equivalent to saying that echie ferstetsich der auf.

714
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:38,720
And the translator says, understands in the sense of being skilled or expert at it, has the know-how of it.

715
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,040
I mean, Heidegger doesn't say that, but that's what Tarheidi was trying to say.

716
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,680
And the translator is just putting it right into the translation.

717
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:55,920
The meaning of the term, I'm reading again Heidegger, the meaning of the term understanding is intended to go back to this usage in ordinary language.

718
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,561
And that's what's the usage in ordinary language?

719
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:07,280
The notion of understands like he understands how to handle men or he understands how to talk, which means just has the skill of it.

720
01:08:07,281 --> 01:08:37,321
I mean, and the background is certainly made up of all the understandings of how to respond to the two go out and to the two put books on and to two light up the room so that all these particular understandings, copings, interrelated in the referential whole and given meaning as significance, add up to the background, which we and which we understand when we know our way around in the world.

721
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:39,080
That's not wrong.

722
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:46,441
It's just that he's going to use it sort of to cover specific coping know-how, all know-how.

723
01:08:46,441 --> 01:08:49,720
That's and not just the background know-how.

724
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:56,201
That if I when I use this book, then I'm used, then I'm, well, understanding will confuse you there.

725
01:08:56,201 --> 01:09:03,240
When I use my pocket calendar to make appointments, I'm understanding how to organize my life.

726
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,281
Okay, let's, that's not a very good example either.

727
01:09:06,281 --> 01:09:08,441
But let's go back to the text.

728
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,600
So it's not cognitive.

729
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:16,120
Now that's where the big difference between it and Searle comes in.

730
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:20,120
I mean, when he says it's cognitive, that means it's not cognitive, I mean.

731
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:21,880
It's not cognitivist.

732
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:35,320
And to be cognitivist is always to think that you need a representation of the goal, of the conditions of satisfaction, and so forth, to talk Searle like, in order to be able to skillfully do whatever.

733
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:48,040
And he wants to say that there is a way of just doing the skillful whatever, which doesn't require thinking, representing, having in mind what it would be like to succeed in doing it.

734
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,200
It is just doing it.

735
01:09:50,521 --> 01:10:00,000
Let me say a little more, because I care so much about all this, which is clearer in Merlot Parilla-Ponty, I think, but Heidegger got it first of anybody in the history of the West.

736
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:08,720
I bet they understand this in other cultures for sure, but ours, thanks to Socrates and Plato and then Descartes, we lost it.

737
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,321
So it includes now, let's see, where are we?

738
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:14,320
Everyday coping with equipment.

739
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,000
Have I read this yet?

740
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,680
Yeah, the primary understanding.

741
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,320
Okay.

742
01:10:19,521 --> 01:10:23,920
And that's Heidegger talk about dealing.

743
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,800
And now, know-how, I think I did this already, but I'm just checking, 183.

744
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:31,441
Yeah, the managing something, being a match for it.

745
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:35,280
That's the nearest we get in being in time to what I'm talking about.

746
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:46,720
And now on 185, he's trying to get rid of the idea that you have to have a goal and even say that you can't do it very well if you're trying to have a goal.

747
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:50,080
And therefore, let's call it, and now comes a new thing.

748
01:10:50,561 --> 01:10:52,000
Well, what is understanding?

749
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,960
It's projecting into the future.

750
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,240
It's projection, he says at the top of 185.

751
01:10:58,241 --> 01:11:00,481
And let's read the bottom of 184 then.

752
01:11:00,481 --> 01:11:11,600
Why does the understanding, whatever may be the essential dimensions of that which can be disclosed, always press, never mind forward, always press into possibilities.

753
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:18,160
It is because the understanding has in itself the existential structure we call projection.

754
01:11:18,161 --> 01:11:22,720
That is, the projection doesn't mean having in mind a goal.

755
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:37,760
It just means, for instance, if it's hot, being drawn to open the window, even though you may be thinking about something else and your goal wasn't to get cool, even, it was just what familiarity with rooms drew you to do.

756
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:43,401
That's what projection and pressing into possibilities ought to mean.

757
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:56,680
Heidegger's not too sharp on it because it sounds at least too much like you've got to have in mind the possibilities and then press into them.

758
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:03,960
That's how it looks from the outside that you can see somebody pressing into the possibility of going out.

759
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:15,720
But the person going out is just responding skillfully to the two go out and doesn't have, and that means they haven't even, they don't even have to know there's a door there.

760
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,880
I mean, that's not part of their experience.

761
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,120
It doesn't have to be at this basic level.

762
01:12:20,121 --> 01:12:25,561
So you say they're going out and they're using the door as a way to go out.

763
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:31,160
They just respond to the two go out, which draws them to go out.

764
01:12:31,161 --> 01:12:37,800
And that being drawn to go out is what Heidegger, I think, misleadingly calls pressing into possibilities.

765
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,600
It's too, that sounds too active.

766
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,361
But what you ought to be saying is drawn into possibilities.

767
01:12:45,000 --> 01:13:05,160
And since he doesn't say that, my way to save him is to say what he really means is that we're thrown into being drawn into possibilities, where the thrownness has sort of got the future orientation in it without any sense of you having to think about what you're doing at all.

768
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:12,840
At this basic level, you just have this when you're finding your way around in the world and managing things, you don't have to think at all.

769
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:18,920
And even pressing into possibility sounds like you see the possibility and then you say, I'll go for that one.

770
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:23,000
That's from your own experience, it needn't be like that.

771
01:13:23,481 --> 01:13:28,160
Okay, I'm still trying to convince you and tell you what's going on here.

772
01:13:28,401 --> 01:13:31,760
So there's no how, and we, what's in the commentary?

773
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,720
Did I just read it?

774
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,481
I think I just did.

775
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,441
I did, but did I look what I read?

776
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:40,240
I've got to go back and look.

777
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,680
Yeah, that's what I read already.

778
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:50,880
And now 185, that's what I read about.

779
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,680
Okay.

780
01:13:54,321 --> 01:13:58,321
Not having a goal, not having conditions of satisfaction.

781
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,561
Did I read that?

782
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,320
185.

783
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:15,441
Yes, yes, of course, this is very important, 185, right here toward the top of 185, bottom of 145.

784
01:14:16,081 --> 01:14:18,561
After that crucial line I already read.

785
01:14:18,561 --> 01:14:24,720
The character of understanding as projection is constituted for being in the world with regard to the disposiveness and so-and-so.

786
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:32,240
And as throwing, Dasein, this backs up my idea that you're thrown into being drawn into.

787
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:36,160
As throwing Dasein is thrown into the kind of being we call projecting.

788
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:38,160
Projecting has nothing to do.

789
01:14:38,161 --> 01:14:41,120
This is the, this is exactly what I'm saying.

790
01:14:41,121 --> 01:14:49,280
Projection has nothing to do with comporting oneself towards a plan that's been thought out and in accordance with which Dasein arranges its being.

791
01:14:49,281 --> 01:15:00,720
On the contrary, any Dasein as Dasein already projects, well, as Dasein already projected itself, and as long as it is, it is projecting.

792
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:06,880
As long as it is, Dasein always has understood itself and always will understand itself in terms of possibilities.

793
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,040
And then it's going on.

794
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,880
I mean, this is the, I've just been explaining this paragraph.

795
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:12,920
Remember, don't get lost.

796
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:20,200
This is all what he means by basic understanding, what the translation calls primary understanding.

797
01:15:20,201 --> 01:15:27,401
And it's more basic than thinking about things, planning things, and so forth.

798
01:15:27,401 --> 01:15:28,200
So let's go on.

799
01:15:28,201 --> 01:15:39,800
Furthermore, the character of understanding as projecting is such that the understanding does not grasp thematically that upon which it projects.

800
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:43,000
Interestingly enough, the translators are amazing.

801
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,880
There is this word, remember, Vorau Hin.

802
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:52,280
And it usually means, and in the part on worldhood, it always means that on the basis of which.

803
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:59,160
And the translator back there always, almost always calls it towards which, which makes the passage completely unintelligible.

804
01:15:59,161 --> 01:16:06,840
Well, now that it's finally appropriate to translate Vorau Hin towards which, he translates it upon which.

805
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,040
So that's the middle of 185.

806
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:15,880
The understanding does not grasp thematically that upon which it projects.

807
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:21,080
But there, I mean, you don't project upon something, or at least that's not the point.

808
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:27,080
You project some future activity, like being out of the room.

809
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:31,720
The understanding does not grasp that towards which it projects.

810
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,960
That is to say, possibilities.

811
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:42,280
Grasping and say, now, if you grasp the possibilities as something you were trying to do, you've got to get this feel.

812
01:16:42,241 --> 01:16:51,880
There's if you're in flow, then you're doing something very, very well, and it's just one and you just can let yourself be absorbed in it.

813
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,840
And then, and then if you st if you think about it, it spoils for.

814
01:16:56,561 --> 01:17:03,280
If you reflect on it, if you even if you just monitor it, that is, sort of keep an eye on what you're doing.

815
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:16,800
All those things may be important to do, but they're not as basic as a very skillful person already in a familiar room doing the net just doing the managing of everything that they can do.

816
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:29,120
And that's and he has to keep saying this, and if you know Searle, you can see why, because he wants to put Searle and Husserl and Descartes at the non-basic, non-primary level.

817
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:34,640
He doesn't want to deny that, of course, you can have goal-directed coping.

818
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:40,000
And so let me just, I see time is up, but I have to see just where I want to stop.

819
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,280
Then I will stop.

820
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:45,920
Well, I'm going to finish this paragraph.

821
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,241
Grasping it in such a manner would take away from what is projected its very character as possibility.

822
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:53,361
This is, remember, paying attention to it would spoil it.

823
01:17:53,361 --> 01:17:55,281
Reduce it to the contents of the mind.

824
01:17:55,281 --> 01:18:01,920
Whereas projection in throwing throws before itself the possibility as possibility and lets it be as such.

825
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,800
Notice now that I just have time to say this.

826
01:18:05,521 --> 01:18:06,720
My watch is slow, isn't it?

827
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,160
It's after 12.30 already.

828
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:09,680
Okay, I still want one more minute.

829
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,880
There's a clock you're looking at.

830
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,080
You're seeing a clock up there.

831
01:18:12,161 --> 01:18:12,640
No.

832
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,880
Okay, so anyway, I just want to say that the end of that sentence is important.

833
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:23,680
As projecting, understanding is the kind of being of Dasai in which it is its possibilities as possibilities.

834
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:38,481
That's to say that just as that's the structural connection between being a teacher, which is not something you're thinking about and seeing as a future success, like getting tenure.

835
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:40,561
Now you can see it at the most basic level.

836
01:18:41,081 --> 01:18:52,521
Also, your everyday hands-on coping is not done by seeing possibilities which you then want to make actual.

837
01:18:52,521 --> 01:19:00,200
It's just that the possibility just is, and again, he doesn't say it very clearly, draws you in.

838
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:08,200
And you get so absorbed in being drawn in that you can say that Dasein just is its possibility.

839
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:11,401
And that's structurally, that's the structural common thing.

840
01:19:11,401 --> 01:19:14,600
When I'm being a teacher, I just am my possibilities.

841
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:27,240
When I'm coping with all the equipment for being a teacher transparently, I just am those possibilities like a mountain climber just is the mountain they're climbing, or whatever other analogies you want.

842
01:19:27,241 --> 01:19:28,840
Okay, we'll start with that next time.

843
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:34,040
But go and read the interpretation part because we're going to get to that next time.
