1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
So let me go back to last time, which I'm may well seem to be obsessing about, and I sort of am, but it's because it seems to me very important.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:30,960
And I was trying, because it's helpful to have some kind of perspective on this, to explain why what Heidegger's doing in this part where he's going from interpretation to assertion, and then finally from assertion to logic, is he's answering the following question.

3
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:41,039
I mean, for one, it's sort of deep and original of him to get him into a position where he has to answer the following question.

4
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:58,639
If we are always already involved in the world, constantly dealing with things in specific situations, how do we come to experience de-situated entities and so that we can make theories about them, which we clearly do?

5
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,519
And then I was worrying about that.

6
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:18,799
Maybe there's no answer to, if you think that means how can situated beings like us ever have totally deworlded, de-situated theories about things, maybe there's no sensible answer to that.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,359
I've decided I don't know what the answer is.

8
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,919
I think Heidegger's question isn't how is it possible for us to do that, but what's involved in doing it.

9
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:44,719
So the question is, what is involved when a situated entity like us is able or does, just does theory, and of which the special case is logic.

10
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:56,599
When you see what's involved, this is what I was already saying last time, then you'll get to see why logic can't capture our everyday understanding.

11
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:06,760
You'll get to see why certain problems in logic, I'll mention one when we get there, are bound to arrive and are going to be insoluble for logic.

12
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,239
And that's why, enough of why it's important.

13
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:18,119
But another way to see how it's original is: it's a question that's never been asked in the history of philosophy.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,559
Maybe a little bit by Husserl, and we'd have to give him credit.

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,760
There's a book called Experience and Judgment, which is based on notes of Husserl.

16
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:38,599
And Husserl's trying to derive how we can get S is P, a subject with properties, by a certain kind of abstraction from perception.

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:49,639
But Heidegger's move is to say, let's not do it from perception, which is already a sort of step along the way towards standing back and looking at things.

18
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,239
Let's do it the most basic and the hardest way.

19
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's see how steps get you from totally involved coping, absorbed in the world, to a position where you are standing outside the world, or at least outside, well, first outside the local situation, and finally deworlded altogether when you're talking about galaxies and electrons.

20
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,760
By what steps do you get there?

21
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:33,239
And what I want to say about it is it's so original because no philosophers have ever, with this possible exception of Husserl, who sees there's a problem, have tried to deal with this.

22
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:40,399
And why would it be that none of these very smart philosophers for 2,000 years have tried to deal with this problem?

23
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:52,160
It's because Heidegger thinks, and rightly I think, that all philosophers start with the desituated contemplation of them as subjects standing over against substances with properties.

24
00:03:52,160 --> 00:04:01,599
That's where Aristotle, who Heidegger thinks is the nearest to getting it, getting in touch with the phenomenon and getting in touch with common sense in a good way.

25
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,639
That no philosopher has done better than Aristotle.

26
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,480
That Aristotle didn't do this.

27
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:16,639
Aristotle didn't start with how does the world show up to involved dealers like us and get to be what philosophers study.

28
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,760
He just assumed that, well, he sat back and looked at things, and what did he see?

29
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,440
Substances with properties.

30
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,799
So he started there.

31
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
It's just like Aristotle, like, and Descartes just pushed it one step further.

32
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:43,839
He said that he would get rid of all his passions and close himself up in a warm room and do philosophy, making it certain that he was going to not see the way we are every day involved with things and people.

33
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:53,440
So Heidegger's got an original problem, and since nobody else has dealt with it before, he's got an original attempt at a solution.

34
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,200
And what would a solution be?

35
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:05,919
It would be to tell you the steps by which an involved being gets out of it and gets into being a detached thinking being.

36
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,639
And because we certainly do it, and why would you care?

37
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:18,079
Well, I keep wanting to say people wouldn't have made the mistake of trying to do artificial intelligence if they had realized this.

38
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:38,599
They realized how much is what's when if you realize what's involved in getting to theories and the abstract structure of the world and the theories, namely logic, you would have a different attitude toward what you could and couldn't do with formal models.

39
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:46,919
And you would see what goes into formalization and what you can't get from a formal model.

40
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,200
And what you can't get is what human beings have all the time, namely meaningful situations.

41
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,800
I don't think that's controversial, but it may be puzzling.

42
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,280
Everybody's looking at me very puzzled.

43
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,719
I'm convinced it's important.

44
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:11,799
I'm convinced that Heidegger's very interesting and that he's made the first moves in this, but it's so quick.

45
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,159
And in Heidegger, you could ask about every move he makes, yeah, but what's involved in doing that?

46
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,360
But we're going to go over the whole thing one more time.

47
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:25,800
If you don't like this, you can turn off your podcast or leave.

48
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,000
But I have to do it because I have to get this clear.

49
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:40,440
I made such a mess of trying to make sense of 196 and 197, and you were all in there trying to help me, starting with 195.

50
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:54,360
And so I resolved that I was going to read page 195 to page 202 over and over until I could understand why he seems to be repeating the points that he's making and dropping pieces here and there.

51
00:06:54,359 --> 00:07:01,320
And now I think I can give you an account of how it makes sense that he develops what he's doing and the way he's doing it.

52
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,679
So let's see.

53
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:26,800
First, he wants to say that predication, which he's already discussed, is what the assertions do, that there is predication is what makes possible or is involved in, I think you could say here, makes possible the decontextualization of our understanding.

54
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
And so, but we have to see how that happens.

55
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:44,720
We have to see how we get a step back and a kind of detachment that enables us to encounter sort of subjects and sort of objects.

56
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,479
I mean, that's what's interesting about it.

57
00:07:47,440 --> 00:08:00,479
The stage of the first stage of assertions that he gives an example of is a situated assertion of an involved dealer, namely, the hammer is too heavy.

58
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:20,719
So we have to first talk about that first step, which brings you not as a self-sufficient Cartesian kind of subject, but as an involved design into relation not with an object, but with equipment that happens to be showing up for you because it's got something wrong with it.

59
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:23,840
It doesn't have to have been a breakdown like too heavy.

60
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,239
It could have been, is perfect for this kind of hammering.

61
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,839
I never had such a good hammer.

62
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:38,720
Any way that something would happen that would call your attention to the hammering and drag you out of your absorption would be the same kind of thing.

63
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,600
And so he's starting on 196.

64
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,520
And you say, we have this funny problem, which we ran into at the end last time, remember?

65
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:57,079
Where he's going to do it all in terms of the hammer is too heavy on the bottom of 196, and then lo and behold, he's back asserting that the hammer is too heavy at the bottom of 199.

66
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,920
And part of the puzzle I was trying to figure out is why is he telling you this twice?

67
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:12,359
In fact, he tells you a third time back on 412 or something, but then he's telling you how you get clear to Newton and Mass.

68
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:15,240
He doesn't get that far with it here.

69
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:17,079
So here we go.

70
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,079
So the hammer is too heavy.

71
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:24,440
On 196, he says that, well he brings in assertion and predication.

72
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,840
Assertion means no less than predication in quotes.

73
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,520
I think that's because there's two kinds of predication.

74
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,240
There's situated predication, and that's the too heavy story.

75
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:45,960
And then there's desituated predication, which is the hammer is heavy story, has weight.

76
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,160
Then that's not for me in my situation.

77
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,240
But first, he's going to tell you the situated kind.

78
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,760
That's why he keeps having to go back to the too heavy.

79
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:07,160
So he says, where it says number two at the bottom of 196, the bottom of 154 in German, assertion means no less than predication.

80
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,959
We assert, all this is in quotes.

81
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:30,920
Either it could be in quotes just because he's calling attention, but I think he's telling you now that this isn't really a full-fledged assertion, doing the full-fledged job of predication, which is going to be this desituated kind, but it's still a kind of predication, then a kind of assertion, because I'm asserting the hammer is too heavy.

82
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:52,079
That is, it's got the form of there is a something or other which has a quotes property, something or other, too heavy, but it's, as I say, not a desituated something or other like an object or a substance, and it's not a general property that you're predicating of it.

83
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,760
But we start there.

84
00:10:53,759 --> 00:11:10,400
So that is, it's a, you assert a quote predicate of a quote subject, where subject doesn't mean, you know, a human Dasein subject, it means subjects have predicates, like the lectern is brown.

85
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,479
It's a grammatical subject.

86
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:16,880
The lectern is the grammatical subject of an assertion.

87
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,040
The lectern is brown.

88
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,960
So we assert a predicate of a subject, and the subject is given a definite character by the predicate.

89
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,320
What does that mean?

90
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,279
Well, it's given the character brown.

91
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,480
It could have been hard, it could have been heavy, it could have been lots of other predicates.

92
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:40,560
And that's the sense in which at the bottom of 196, there's been a narrowing of content.

93
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:43,520
And why is there a narrowing of content?

94
00:11:43,519 --> 00:12:03,120
Because we're now, because we went from something like a general coping with the lectern to paying attention to one specific, I want to say, aspect of it, namely, well, let's stick with the hammer, one specific aspect, and then we too heavy.

95
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,399
That's the first move.

96
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,480
Now let me see where we are.

97
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:14,880
At the top, he's saying that, at the top of 197.

98
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,560
Every predication is what it is, only as a pointing out.

99
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,280
That's going to be true at all these levels.

100
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,960
The second signification of assertion has its foundation in the first.

101
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:33,000
That's this business of each stage underlying and in a certain way making possible the next stage.

102
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:42,360
The way it makes it possible is he thinks you couldn't get to these more abstract kind of assertions except starting out involved and leaving things out.

103
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,599
So the second kind is founded in the first.

104
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,120
What's the second kind?

105
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:56,200
With this pointing out, the elements which are articulated in predication, the subject and the predicate, arise.

106
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,480
Oh, I hadn't noticed that.

107
00:12:57,719 --> 00:13:01,320
Walking over here, I had exactly this interesting question.

108
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,800
I'll give it to you now because I may forget it.

109
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,720
And I think it's fascinating.

110
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:16,440
I mean, you want to know when, because later he's going to say, when we get the predicate heavy, we discover the predicate was there all along.

111
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,400
That was heavy all along.

112
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:27,800
So sometimes when you reveal a predicate, there's some way it's already been there.

113
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:36,040
The way the presentative hand already underlies the ready-to-hand of a hammer, a way which we're never very clear about, and neither is Heidegger.

114
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:45,560
And later, I think we're not very clear about, he's not very clear about either, which is how this predicate heavy sort of has been there and now gets loosened.

115
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,479
But here, and I was thinking as I walked over, yeah, but isn't that funny?

116
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:55,240
Because the predicate too heavy isn't somehow in the hammer, all along.

117
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,719
It arises in a particular situation.

118
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:14,079
When I pick up the hammer, it gets the property, quotes property, this funny kind of property, too heavy, and when I get either more athletic or put it away without wasting words and get another hammer, that property just vanishes from the hammer.

119
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,920
It's not too heavy anymore.

120
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,320
So it's a very peculiar kind of property.

121
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,240
And once it looks like that kind of property can arise relative to us.

122
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,760
Now I don't know the answer to this.

123
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,079
Why do we think that the property being heavy doesn't arise relative to us?

124
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,280
I mean, so the hammer only gets the property, quotes property too heavy because it's too heavy for me in this situation.

125
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:51,520
But at the next stage, which I'm going to talk about next, you discover that the property, the hammer has the general property, heaviness, and it has it all the time.

126
00:14:51,920 --> 00:15:40,520
The question sort of is, well, how come we say that and don't think, well, oh, isn't that interesting when I focus on the hammer in its and what it has in well yeah I was saying this yesterday but I I don't want to say more about it today but when I was talking about you know the red of fire engines the red of sweaters the red of apples and so forth you could get a similar thing you could say well there's hammer heavy and book heavy and brick heavy and lo and behold and with with hyphens they've each got their own kind of hammery heaviness and booky heaviness and bricky heaviness but you can also see them as all having weight you can even see them as all weighing five pounds.

127
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:53,160
And so now it looks like that's been a characteristic of them all along uh so there's all kinds of I what I really want to do is not solve this, but show you, maybe some of you will write honors theses or PhD theses on it.

128
00:15:53,160 --> 00:16:13,160
There's a whole new industry in here of how, remember what it is, what's involved in getting from being a situated design to being the kind of subject, thinking subject, or theorizing subject that philosophers have thought we were all along.

129
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,640
Okay.

130
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:19,400
I just keep repeating this because I'm telling myself it over and over, because it's new to me.

131
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:24,280
I mean, I've had it sort of dimly always in mind, but I think I got it a lot clearer.

132
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,039
Does anybody want to say anything?

133
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,999
I mean, if you do, say so, because you're looking sort of, I don't know, stunned.

134
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Go ahead.

135
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:50,999
Well, I think if we know that the conditions in which he formulates sentences about gained vitality, whether that is the predicate would just be primarily predicate.

136
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:58,999
Well, except that he's going to tell us that this isn't quite a real predicate yet.

137
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:08,360
And because it isn't a universal property yet, I mean, property is ambiguous, of course.

138
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,640
All of this is.

139
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:18,600
But I don't think, I mean, it's about assertions, but it's also about the status of what is revealed in these assertions.

140
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,160
They're apophantic or they're hermeneutic.

141
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,520
That is, they either reveal a situational something or other.

142
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,400
Aspect.

143
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,680
I'm going to use my word.

144
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,719
Instead of saying property in quotes, which is, I think, what he's doing, I want to say aspect.

145
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:39,440
And you can, sometimes you assert something that reveals an aspect, and sometimes you assert that it's too heavy.

146
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:43,680
And sometimes you assert something that reveals a property, namely, the hammer's heavy.

147
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:49,200
And the assertion has an interesting jaw in that it can do either.

148
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,719
But Heidegger thinks, I don't know what the argument is, but I don't know where it is, but we could find it if I took time out to look for it.

149
00:17:56,719 --> 00:18:07,920
He thinks that the assertion does two things, but its genuine function is to do the second thing, namely to predicate a property of an independent substance.

150
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,800
Why is that?

151
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,840
That's its, I don't know what to say.

152
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,279
He asks something like that question at the top of some page back here.

153
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:31,759
Yes, he's asking, in what sense is the detached mode to be understood as, well, no, that's a different issue, but it's okay.

154
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,039
But I will get to it.

155
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,559
No, I'm not going to jump ahead.

156
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,279
I'll leave it open.

157
00:18:39,279 --> 00:19:03,200
I hope you help me remember that somewhere he's going to tell us that the assertion, as David is right, we're talking about, has two functions, namely, pointing out aspects and pointing out properties, and when it points out real properties, then it's got real predicates, and until that, it's got something more fundamental.

158
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,479
Now, well, Tyler wanted to say something, yeah.

159
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,039
With a few steps in between, you know.

160
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:29,240
Too heavy, too heavy, to weighs five pounds, to has a certain mass.

161
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,559
Yes, that's what he does on page 412.

162
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:46,759
Okay, well, heavy isn't we we ran into this in office hours.

163
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,440
Some of you who were there will know.

164
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,920
Heavy is got the same ambiguity that assertions have.

165
00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:01,319
If you say this hammer is heavy, you could say it in a way and mean it in a way, and people can understand it in a way that this hammer is too heavy for this job.

166
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:04,440
But you can also say it in a completely detached sort of way.

167
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,680
Hammers have weight, which is the way he puts it at one point.

168
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:15,800
Then it doesn't mean anymore that it isn't emphasizing anymore that using it is difficult.

169
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:19,239
It's just telling you a fact about hammers.

170
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:30,440
And it works by the, again, so the predicate heavy is like too heavy, it goes in one direction, or it's got the property, universal property heaviness.

171
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,160
You could even say it shares a property not only with hammers, but apples and cars and so forth.

172
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,039
Now, okay, yeah.

173
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,240
Ah, okay.

174
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,240
Well, what do I want to do about that?

175
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:45,880
I don't know.

176
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:54,280
It doesn't, I mean, then he has no word to distinguish the difference between aspects and properties in the German, I guess.

177
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:11,840
Well, except it does give them a definite character, but he needs, doesn't he, the difference between situated, definite characters, and desituated definite characters, as in too heavy and heavy.

178
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,279
And I don't know if he has a word for it.

179
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,319
I was thinking that predicate in quotes was doing the job.

180
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,680
Did you hear what Eugene said?

181
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,920
In the German, predicate isn't in quotes.

182
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:40,079
But he's clear, we'll just keep our eyes open, that he's moving from a hermeneutic sense, a situated sense of predicate, to an apophantic, purely apophantic sense, which means pointing out something in a desituated, or pointing out something in a way that's neutral, whether it's desituated or not.

183
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,479
And that's his step.

184
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,639
But so let me leave that for a moment, unless you want to say more.

185
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,239
But doesn't he bring in property there at the point where it's in quotes in a contextual way?

186
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,879
Guess what?

187
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,799
Ah, I see.

188
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,999
So predicates, so properties, you want to say, is always the desituated version.

189
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:19,599
And does he have a word?

190
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,839
And predicate is neutral.

191
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,400
That sounds right, because predicate is whatever comes after the is.

192
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,519
So the hammer is, whatever, too heavy, you know, whatever.

193
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,959
But then he has no word.

194
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:42,479
There's a sort of gap in there for what goes with the predicate when it's not a property, but uh well, I want to say aspect.

195
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:46,479
And he needs that, because the whole point is he's giving you these these steps.

196
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:55,399
And the big, and I want to keep saying, the big step, which he later calls the changeover, is the switch from the involved to the detached.

197
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,560
He's got all kinds of degrees in between, but he does think that there's a that something important happens.

198
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:10,039
I don't know whether di bit by bit or all at once, but he calls it a changeover from the situated to the desituated.

199
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,079
Yeah.

200
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,360
Whereas he runs situated.

201
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:51,479
There's not a strong phenomenological, it's not necessary to make the natural.

202
00:23:51,479 --> 00:24:02,680
It's not necessary, but it's possible to make the next switch, and the next switch is a changeover, and without it, we couldn't be the kind of theoretical thinking beings that we are.

203
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:09,400
I mean, animals presumably get along fine on the level of aspects and situated stuff.

204
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:16,120
They don't make assertions, but they do respond to situated aspects of things.

205
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,759
I mean, the the the bone can be too heavy or too old or something for them.

206
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:28,440
But uh we we theoretical beings can just step outside and do the special thing.

207
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,999
Uh okay, I saw one more handover here.

208
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:33,080
Uh didn't I?

209
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,440
I'm sure I did.

210
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:35,320
Yeah?

211
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,719
He does, wait a minute.

212
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:04,239
He does care whether it's situated heaviness or not, because he says it's too heavy.

213
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,479
And too heavy is situated to heaviness.

214
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:09,680
There's no such thing as de-situated to heaviness.

215
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,840
And moreover, he says there's a changeover.

216
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,239
You are all getting so concerned about.

217
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,879
Here's the changeover on page 200.

218
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,959
It seems like I suspect we can say it now as well as later.

219
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:28,400
The entity in the middle of the page, the second full paragraph, just at the bottom of 157 in German.

220
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,799
The entity which is held in our forehaving, for instance, the hammer, is proximally ready to hand as equipment, period.

221
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:45,360
If this entity becomes the object of an assertion, and that means a full-fledged assertion, then as soon as we begin this assertion, there is a changeover in the forehaving.

222
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:52,400
Something ready to hand with which we had to do or perform something turns into something about which the assertion that points out is made.

223
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,160
Our foresight is aimed at something present at hand in the ready to hand.

224
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,719
That's a big deal switch.

225
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:05,839
The ready to hand is too heavy, or really it's unready to hand, but it's still in the ready-to-hand business if it's too heavy.

226
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:15,040
And just being heavy in the sense you're going to use it, is a detached thing, and you can weigh it, and it's got five pounds.

227
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,079
It's a big deal.

228
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:25,799
I mean, very big, is the big deal if you're going to try to tell people the steps involved in becoming a theoretical kind of detached.

229
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,559
How many read McDowell in any course?

230
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,719
I mean, McDowell is in the back of my mind.

231
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:38,119
He's thinking, oh boy, we are the kind of creatures that everything we do is conceptual through and through.

232
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:49,239
Heidegger's going to deny that, but he's going to say, well, but we are the kind of creatures that a big chunk of what we do is conceptual through and through, and a big chunk of what we do is non-conceptual.

233
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:52,920
And we want to know how you can bring them both together.

234
00:26:52,920 --> 00:27:05,479
I mean, I keep, when I argue with McDowell, using Merlot-Ponty and talking about the pre-linguistic and the non-conceptual, and McDowell keeps saying there is no pre-linguistic and there is no non-conceptual.

235
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:09,799
And I want to say, and we can be so involved that there isn't even any sort of us.

236
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,759
And he wants to say we're always minded.

237
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,999
There's always an I in there doing it.

238
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:21,559
And the answer is we're both getting into absurdly, outrageously extreme position.

239
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:28,999
I'm doing the, trying to say, well, the really basic, important, foundational thing is the coping level.

240
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:35,799
And he's trying to say what really makes us human beings and separates us from animals is that we're always on the conceptual level.

241
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:38,920
And the answer is in what we're talking about today.

242
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:46,920
There ought to be steps involved in getting from one to the other so you can see how we can be both.

243
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,039
Okay?

244
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,519
Yeah.

245
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:06,840
And that is the transition from the involved culture, that is, the experience of the world, which has processed to come up with how to find content.

246
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:14,319
And then the Heidegger thought, but we also what?

247
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah.

248
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,039
We cope with people and then, I mean, with other people, too.

249
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,360
Wait, wait, don't say anymore.

250
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,320
I've got my head full.

251
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,840
I mean, I don't want to bring in other people.

252
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,120
That's another story.

253
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,759
I mean, that's the communication level.

254
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,479
And he mentions it, you know.

255
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,359
That's the third function of assertions.

256
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,839
But he doesn't, and maybe this is important.

257
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:41,200
I'll translate what you're saying to something important to me.

258
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,360
Well, maybe you can't.

259
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,400
I mean, what you're doing is telling us something to pay attention to, which is important.

260
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:57,599
I mean, it looks like Heidegger doesn't think that the shared communication plays an essential role in this switchover.

261
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,799
I think he doesn't.

262
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,160
You've got to watch.

263
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,479
So he just sort of puts that aside.

264
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:05,119
It's important and it is shared.

265
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:13,999
And when we get to discourse, that's what discourse is about, is the way we share this, our interpretation and our understanding.

266
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:19,039
But I think he does this whole story only with the middle one.

267
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,800
That is number two.

268
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,479
Assertion is predication.

269
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,920
So let's wait and see.

270
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:35,360
But I can see that, and somebody could make a case that we couldn't be the kind of being that can make this switchover unless we were sharing the world with other human beings, other Daseins.

271
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,959
I don't think Heidegger thinks that.

272
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,239
I couldn't cite a text.

273
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,360
Okay, let me go back onward.

274
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,319
Where are we?

275
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,039
Let's see.

276
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,479
So he's got the hammer's too heavy, and it's a not yet a detached subject.

277
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:52,479
I think I just read that.

278
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:06,759
Yeah, I got stuck, and I wanted to mark it on how the subject and predicate arise out of our stepping back when there's a problem or stepping back.

279
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,519
However, I have a pen.

280
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,920
My pens are always disappearing.

281
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,719
Help.

282
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,719
Again, I need a pen.

283
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,039
Thanks.

284
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:21,080
Okay, I just want, because I thought that arises, an interesting thing.

285
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,519
But now we're going to go on.

286
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:27,239
So it turns out now we just get used to the word apophantic.

287
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:35,799
Apophantic means, this is, we're still in 197, letting something be seen by pointing it out.

288
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:46,759
And now you get that talked about at the, if we go down a little, we get restricting about ten lines down, that's this narrowing.

289
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:51,479
And then in giving something a definite character, that's the narrowing.

290
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:54,200
I give the hammer the definite character too heavy.

291
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:02,200
We must, in the first instance, take a step back when confronted with that which is already manifest, the hammer that is too heavy.

292
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:11,959
So we already have to experience the hammer is too heavy, and then we can make step back and make the assertion about it that it's too heavy.

293
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,920
But we don't step all the way back.

294
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,719
We step halfway back, if you see what I mean.

295
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:29,879
We step back from our total absorption in the ready-to-hand, which withdraws and we just press into possibilities, to making an assertion about the hammer that it's too heavy.

296
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,880
But we don't step, so to speak, out of the situation, because if we did, the hammer wouldn't be too heavy anymore.

297
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,479
So we take a step back, the hammer's too heavy.

298
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,920
In setting down the subject, we dim entities down to focus in.

299
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,200
The hammer there, focus down to focus in the hammer there.

300
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,319
We dim entities down to focus.

301
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:52,479
Wouldn't it be on that hammer there?

302
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,200
Am I being dyslexic as usual?

303
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,680
I don't.

304
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,280
Seems to me it's just a typo.

305
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:07,840
On that hammer there, so that by thus dimming them down, we may let that which is manifest be seen in its own definite character as a character that can be determined.

306
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,440
All of that is just the same stuff we've been saying over and over.

307
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:21,519
But now comes the sentence I was preparing you to see next: setting down the subject, setting down the predicate, and setting down the two together are thoroughly apophantic in the strict sense of the word.

308
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:29,839
Now, I at least used to think that apophantic was only after you got detached, and so I was shocked to read it.

309
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,879
We read this this morning, that that's all right.

310
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:52,639
That is, to be apophantic is to be pointed out as it is, with its own definite character, and you can have situated apophantic or non-situated apophantic, but the situated ones, if you do it situatedly, Heidegger calls it hermeneutic.

311
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,599
That is, whenever it's an interpretation within a context, it's hermeneutic.

312
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:11,279
And now I think assertions can be apophantic, and they can also be hermeneutic, that is said from within a situation, but they needn't be.

313
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,239
And that's all right.

314
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,160
I'm just telling you the terminology there.

315
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,600
There's nothing deep by what I just said.

316
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,039
So let's see.

317
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,600
I wanted to say.

318
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:30,599
Yeah.

319
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,239
Okay.

320
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:37,160
It's the interpretation is hermeneutic in a specific situation on 199.

321
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,759
I'll just follow through and tell you where he says it.

322
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,080
I mean, he says it all right, but I don't see Google marked it right.

323
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,160
Let me see, on 199.

324
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:15,480
No, he doesn't use the term hermeneutic there, so I know point in my referring you to that.

325
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,599
Let's try 201, and if he doesn't use it there either, I'll stop.

326
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,479
Oh, yeah, there he is.

327
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:22,359
Okay, he puts it here.

328
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,559
So he's back telling you how the assertion narrows things.

329
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,919
Only now he says that less you see at the top of 201 the present at hand and so forth.

330
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:40,040
So now we're getting to the special kind of assertion that desituates.

331
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:53,480
This leveling of the primordial as of circumspective interpretation, that's the situated one, too heavy, to the as with which presence at hand is given a definite character is the specialty of assertion.

332
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,759
Only so does it obtain the possibility of exhibiting something in such a way that we just look at it.

333
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:01,559
We've been talking about that, so it's fine to read that.

334
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,440
And now he throws in this fancy terminology.

335
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:10,480
Thus, assertion cannot disown its ontological origin from an interpretation which understands.

336
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:14,880
That means the hammer's too heavy kind of talk.

337
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:34,800
The primordial as of an interpretation, where you're experiencing the hammer as too heavy, which understands circumspectively, is called existential hermeneutic as, in distinction from the apophantic as of the assertion, namely, you assert that the hammer has weight.

338
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:37,280
I don't know how you put the as in there.

339
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,279
How would you get?

340
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,640
You want to somehow an example of the proposition.

341
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:53,680
You assert that the hammer has weight, but how do you can't you assert it, somehow assert it in a way that lets you use the as?

342
00:35:56,879 --> 00:36:00,160
You assert that the hammer has, I don't know, I don't know.

343
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,719
What the as is, is how he's what is the apophantical as of the assertion?

344
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,079
And again, this is not deep, this is just terminological.

345
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:26,400
There's no doubt that when you assert it, you assert that you assert something about the hammer as heavy, or you, with its apophantical, or you assert in your behavior or in your language the hammer as too heavy.

346
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,799
But you could say this hammer is too heavy.

347
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,479
And then maybe it's just us from the outside who see that statement.

348
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,320
The hammer is too heavy as asserting something as something.

349
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,079
Is there a problem?

350
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,120
I don't know.

351
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,200
Not a serious problem.

352
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,839
But it is.

353
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:57,320
Yeah, SSP is asserting something as something, even though in the assertion, S is P, the as doesn't get in there.

354
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,799
Okay, that is definitely not what we should worry about.

355
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,560
Enough big deal things to worry about.

356
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:09,959
So now we've got the story about how the predicate gets loosened.

357
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,120
But let me see if I'm ready to talk about that.

358
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:26,040
Yeah, the next step is sort of getting the sort of involved predicate too heavy, which is not really, it's a predicate because that's a grammatical statement, but it's not really a property of the hammer.

359
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,840
That's what Eugene was trying to say.

360
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:30,759
So predicate is a grammatical term.

361
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:33,960
It comes after is, and too heavy is a predicate.

362
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:37,880
But now we're going to get from predicates to properties.

363
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:42,440
And first he does a quick overview of the foresture.

364
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:47,640
And every time the forestructure is around, I always try to understand it because he never explains it very well.

365
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,920
So let's try this.

366
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:54,759
The forehaving seems to be just the general situation of hammering.

367
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:59,639
The foresight narrows this to the too heavy, I think.

368
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:20,759
And then if I can assert that the hammer is too heavy, and if but you can't, but you can't take the predicate too heavy and pass it around to other people.

369
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:24,919
Or at least you'd have to say the hammer is too heavy for Burt Kreyfish.

370
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,840
The hammer hasn't got this general property, heaviness.

371
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,680
And I think that's what happens when you pass it around.

372
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:43,520
You go from, you have to go from the too heavy to the hammer is heavy, and that is you go to a desituated predicate, which we call a property.

373
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:52,160
And what is already the foreconception, I take it, because the property is like a concept.

374
00:38:52,719 --> 00:39:00,080
The foregriff sometimes means the pre-grass, but I think it sometimes does mean the pre-what is it?

375
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
The forecast, the foreconceptual.

376
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,239
Here I think it does mean that.

377
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,879
Now, let's see, where am I talking about?

378
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:08,239
199.

379
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,680
I want to talk about somewhere here.

380
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,000
Okay, about 10 lines from the bottom.

381
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,200
Thus, any assertion requires a foresight.

382
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,080
In this, the predicate which we assign and make stands out and gets loosened.

383
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:31,759
That's hammer's too heavy from its unexpressed inclusion in the entity.

384
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,119
Gets loosened.

385
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:37,840
That must be heaviness then.

386
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,759
Okay, so let's try that again.

387
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:42,799
I had it written down, and now I'm deviating from what I wrote down.

388
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,239
That's a bad idea.

389
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,960
No, I still think the foresight narrows in and focuses on the fact that it's too heavy.

390
00:39:51,120 --> 00:40:05,280
Then you get a kind of predicate, which is still a grammatical idea, which, but the predicate stands out and gets loosened from its unexpressed inclusion in the entity.

391
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,520
Which kind of predicate?

392
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,480
The too heavy, or the just has weight?

393
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,759
I don't know.

394
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,359
You think they're too heavy?

395
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,120
Okay, I think that's fine with me.

396
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:24,440
So that, but now you've got some some property, or in this case, an aspect you're pointing out.

397
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,959
Let me go on and read more of this.

398
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:36,680
To any assertion in this communication which gives something a definite character, there belongs, moreover, an articulation of what is pointed out, and this articulation is in accordance with significations.

399
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,040
Such an assertion will operate in a definite way of conceiving.

400
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,639
But now we've got, Dave, it looks like he's, you know, it looks like it's the heavy.

401
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,680
The hammer is heavy.

402
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,039
Heaviness belongs to the hammer.

403
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,480
The hammer has the property.

404
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,519
And now you've got property, not predicate, of heaviness.

405
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,000
When an assertion is made, some foreconception is always implied.

406
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:06,200
So when you get, so even when you get to the, oh boy, I don't know how he's doing it.

407
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,719
In the middle of that sentence.

408
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,519
It sounds like it.

409
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,559
If in the middle of the sentence, he's gone from a predicate like too heavy, which gets loosened.

410
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,999
And when it gets loosened, then it can be taken out, taken away altogether apart.

411
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:43,239
And when you get it apart and pass it around, so everybody can say the hammer has weight, then he's certainly gotten to the level where the interpretation, which was the involved as structure, has gone from forehaving, where you're just coping, to foresight, where you're noticing something about it, namely it's too heavy, to the foreconception, and that's the weight.

412
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,840
That seems to be the story.

413
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:46,360
Okay, trouble, yeah?

414
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,840
It doesn't happen in the passing, right?

415
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,719
I mean, I think you're asking his question.

416
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:07,879
I mean, is the fact that, yeah, is the fact that we're using it to communicate making this happen, or does this happen and then we can use it to communicate?

417
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:09,040
Is that your question?

418
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,999
I think so too.

419
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,799
Now, okay, good.

420
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,479
I'm happy to hear that.

421
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,680
Well, you've got any text?

422
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,680
I think so for him.

423
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,680
You're right.

424
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,399
I noticed that.

425
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:26,959
That's his.

426
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,400
So now we have a new question, and I don't know what the answer is.

427
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:34,239
You can write a paper on it, or at least we can all think about it.

428
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:47,759
Is this changeover that from the situated to the desituated kind of predicate something that happens because it's being used in by it's being used in communication and passed around?

429
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:51,680
Or is it something that enables us to use it in communication and pass it around?

430
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,960
I don't know.

431
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,079
Yeah.

432
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,759
Yeah.

433
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:02,799
Yeah.

434
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,040
That's no changeover yet, because the changeover gets to be the present at hand.

435
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,200
Yes, that's where the loose.

436
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,280
Yeah, and then the availability of seeing it.

437
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:15,680
Yeah.

438
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,840
Which is another step.

439
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:19,440
Right.

440
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:20,799
Yes, I agree.

441
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:21,999
That's what I keep saying.

442
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,079
That just shows how hard it is to say what you want to say.

443
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:27,759
That's what I've been trying to say all along.

444
00:43:27,759 --> 00:43:56,919
What's interesting and important and original is this two-stage story in which the predicate gets loosened when you've got a four-site and you're picking out the the the heaviness to pay attention to, but it doesn't get fully detached and become a real property of the hammer until you go one step further and get rid of the too heavy and just keep the heavy, and that gives you the foregrift.

445
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,799
Then it's conceptual, the foreconceptual is the fore what does it say, foreconceiving?

446
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:04,200
What is the the foregriff?

447
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,319
The foreconception.

448
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:11,160
Yeah, it gives you the and then you're on the conceptual level, that it takes these two stages, or it can.

449
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,320
I mean, and and that's the important thing.

450
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:38,200
If you try to explain what's involved, what's involved would be you don't go right from so absorbed in the door that all you're doing is being is pressing into the to go out to seeing that it's a door and the door is available to anybody to see and it's got the the the property doorness if that's what you you you don't go that way.

451
00:44:38,200 --> 00:45:02,679
You go from the pressing to go out to the noticing that it's a door for some reason or other, because it's a pretty door, because it's a heavy door, whatever, it's a door that's stuck, and then you get and then you go from there, you can, to seeing the door as a having a property which is general.

452
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,880
Properties are general.

453
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:06,920
It's being it's doorness, all the doors have that.

454
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:13,080
Okay, I gotta I this is taking more time than I want, so let me quickly find out where we are.

455
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:36,759
So he wants to derive, now we get this I said already, and I read it already, but I the middle of 200, this is what you gotta keep looking at, which is what what I'm trying to do here, and what he's trying to do, but what existential ontological modifications, by what existential ontological modifications, does assertion arise from circumspective interpretation?

456
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:38,320
You see, that's what we keep doing.

457
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:42,399
Now, I just did it again, but I'm not going to say it again, because I've been saying it over and over.

458
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,120
That's the question that he's telling you the answer to.

459
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,320
Let's see if I don't think I need to say it again, but I'll read what I wrote.

460
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:04,640
It doesn't come from the fact that you just see present-at-hand substances with present-at-hand properties.

461
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,759
That's what you want to show step-by-step how we can do that.

462
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:15,360
So I say that that's on page 200 somewhere, so let's look and see if I can find where.

463
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:20,239
Okay, he's back to the middle, to the top paragraph on 200.

464
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,680
The hammer is too heavy.

465
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,719
We can just say that.

466
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,320
Hand me another hammer.

467
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:32,480
And interpretation is carried out not in a theoretical statement, but in an action of circumspective return, a concern, and so forth.

468
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,800
From the fact that words are absent, it may not be concluded that interpretation is absent.

469
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:44,719
On the other hand, the kind of interpretation which is circumspectively expressed is not already an assertion in the sense that we've defined.

470
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:52,960
That is, where that means the full-fledged assertion, namely attributing a property to a substance.

471
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,040
Now, that gets that.

472
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,560
And hmm, hmm, hmm.

473
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,719
Okay.

474
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:17,280
So then he ends up talking about what I jumped ahead and talked about: namely, he needs to now bring in this capacity to make assertions, full-fledged assertions, that produce the changeover.

475
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:19,279
And that's the last paragraph.

476
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:20,160
That's why.

477
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,120
It's partly, why is he talking about all this stuff again?

478
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:39,239
Well, I think he's now wanting to give you a general story, not just about hammers and too heavy assertions, but the way we go in general from having an evolved, ready-to-hand equipment to the present at hand.

479
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:45,079
So he says in the middle, which I read, the entity which is held in the forehaving is ready-to-handed as equipment.

480
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:51,879
If this entity becomes the object of an assertion, then as soon as we begin this assertion, there's a changeover in the forehaving.

481
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,599
Something ready-to-hand turns into something present at hand.

482
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:02,680
And notice our foresight is aimed at something present at hand in what is ready to hand.

483
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:09,640
There is the funny difference between that and the case where it doesn't look like it's in, but it arises.

484
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,719
And it seems right somehow.

485
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:16,439
You see, that the heaviness of the hammer arises when I try to pick it up.

486
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,400
I'm sorry, the too heavy when I try to pick it up.

487
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:34,039
But now I've got to it's being a hammer or it's having weight, and that seems to be something that's in the ready-to-hand that gets brought out by this way of looking at it, both by and for this way of looking at it.

488
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,920
The ready-to-hand becomes veiled as ready-to-hand.

489
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:49,080
With the discovering of presence at hand, which is at the same time covering up of the ready-to-hand, something, I'm reading from the bottom of 200, something present at hand which we encounter is given a definite character, and it's being present at hand as such.

490
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:53,480
Only now are we given access per properties and the like.

491
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,800
There's the derivation of properties, not aspects, and it's not predicates either, because that's a grammatical thing.

492
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:05,879
Properties is a metaphysical or ontological, and this is where you get them.

493
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,439
We're skipping down a little.

494
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:11,200
The as structure of interpretation has undergone a modification.

495
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:14,160
That's what we're talking about, from situated to desituated.

496
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,160
In this functioning of appropriating what is understood, the as no longer reaches out into a totality of involvements.

497
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,520
That would be situated.

498
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:30,239
As regards its possibilities for articulating reference relations, it's been cut off from that significance, which as such constitutes environmentality.

499
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,640
Well, that all ought to make, I should hope, perfectly good sense to you now.

500
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,360
And I could stop talking about it.

501
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:52,960
What he's done, why he repeated it was, and I think I wrote down, he wants to explain how we can look at situated things in general that have aspects, because that's what they have, in such a way as to see them as substances with properties.

502
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:02,640
And then I think he isn't clear on exactly in what way the properties are already implicit and that we gain access to them, as he says.

503
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,000
But I think he's right.

504
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,640
Somehow the properties are implicit.

505
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,999
That's very tricky.

506
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,239
I mean, they're certainly not implicit in your experience of it when you're just absorbed.

507
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:25,359
But yet, when you find them on reflection, you can't help finding them as already in the object that you get when you desituate and reflect.

508
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:34,960
And they sort of are already in the object, even though they weren't already in the experience that you modified to get the object.

509
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:44,400
It's the same as the as structure, which isn't in your experience when you're just booming along, flowing along, and pressing into possibilities.

510
00:50:44,399 --> 00:50:47,599
But the as structure is then revealed as having been there.

511
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,519
Something has been there as a door.

512
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,079
If you stop and look around, that's just the way it is.

513
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,119
That's how the world is.

514
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:54,999
Hi, Tyler.

515
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,239
Yeah.

516
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,480
No, I don't think it should be only a breakdown.

517
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:11,480
I think the unready to hand ought to be bigger than, I mean, breakdown is a special case.

518
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:17,239
And I try to generalize it at least to disturbance because that sounds like you could disturb the flow.

519
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:32,040
Anything that disturbs the flow, even if it's the hammer is the nicest hammer I ever used, or the thought, boy, I wish I had bought a hammer like this instead of some other hammer, that's going to throw you into the unready to hand, I think.

520
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,519
Ah, okay.

521
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,160
Yeah.

522
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:43,639
Ah, okay, that's what Tyler thinks.

523
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,399
You think that's what Heidegger thinks?

524
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,519
In section or something?

525
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,799
I mean, okay.

526
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:54,359
Well, now we've got an interesting challenge.

527
00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:00,359
I would like there to be unanswered questions, because I think this is an industry, I say, which needs a lot more.

528
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:01,880
But let's, here's one.

529
00:52:01,879 --> 00:52:21,879
Now, so you think that the move from the unready to hand to the ready-to-hand, the thing that he just produced in a quick move over here at the bottom of 200, where you just switch your foresight over, and notice the phrase, if this indices becomes an object of an assertion, then blah, blah, blah, and everything follows.

530
00:52:21,879 --> 00:52:26,359
And you're saying, yeah, but under what conditions does it become an object of an assertion?

531
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:27,719
That's just what you're asking.

532
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:29,320
He doesn't tell us.

533
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:40,640
I doubt if it has to be a breakdown, but I don't understand why it couldn't just become an object of assertion if you just decide to step back and describe it.

534
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,239
Why couldn't you do that?

535
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:43,919
You mean why would you do that?

536
00:52:43,919 --> 00:52:47,440
You can ask back if the flow is flowing along fine.

537
00:52:47,759 --> 00:52:48,880
I don't know.

538
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,200
So let's sharpen up the question.

539
00:52:51,200 --> 00:53:06,880
He owes us an answer to the quick move he makes, which is just that an entity can become an object of an assertion and then whop, it changes over, it gets conceptual, it's ready, it's present at hand.

540
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,680
The question is, I'm just going to state it and put it on the record, so to speak.

541
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,000
Under what conditions is this switchover possible?

542
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,640
Does it have to be the conditions of a breakdown or even a disturbance?

543
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,360
Or if not, what else could it be?

544
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:30,719
Because here everything is in flow and you're doing all right, or at least, or everything is not in flow and you've got a problem.

545
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:38,160
But it looks like, I mean, I think Dewey thinks that unless you've got a problem, you don't switch over to the theoretical.

546
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,520
And maybe that's right.

547
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,399
I don't know.

548
00:53:40,399 --> 00:53:41,040
Yeah.

549
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,359
Well, I wonder, could that put that on the record?

550
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,200
I mean, could it be human curiosity?

551
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:53,520
Could it be that you're getting into a painter frame of mind or an aesthetic way of looking at things?

552
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,239
Or I don't know.

553
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:57,200
I don't know.

554
00:53:57,759 --> 00:53:59,679
And I think it'd be interesting.

555
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,879
Probably there are, again, lots of things to be filled in here.

556
00:54:02,879 --> 00:54:10,079
There are probably conditions, hopefully, under which you can do it in which you have to have some kind of disturbance.

557
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:15,759
And maybe there are conditions in which you do it, in which you don't have to have a disturbance, and I don't know.

558
00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:16,320
Yeah.

559
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,439
Yes, but how out of that?

560
00:54:22,919 --> 00:54:23,799
Oh, that's sure.

561
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:25,799
That's the sentence that he's got.

562
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:28,360
Yeah.

563
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,400
Yes.

564
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:42,439
Well, there's a relative disturbance, a transition is that we, I mean, at least Tyler isn't objecting to that being a kind of disturbance, right?

565
00:54:42,439 --> 00:54:45,239
Like the too heavy.

566
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:53,719
That'll call your attention, and maybe you can't get out of the flow unless something at least sort of interrupts the flow, even if it isn't a breakdown.

567
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:55,640
But now Tyler's raised a new question.

568
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:03,160
How do you get from the situated asserting to the present at hand?

569
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,079
And that's what you need a whole new breakdown or something.

570
00:55:07,399 --> 00:55:08,759
Are you trying to say something?

571
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:15,080
I was just thinking that we can think of any level of trying to get surprised.

572
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,239
Certain, you know, beautiful and quantum.

573
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:30,279
He says, it arrests your attention.

574
00:55:30,279 --> 00:55:31,560
There's a sunset.

575
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:34,840
There's no disturbance there.

576
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:41,320
And if you were running along and you're on your path, and all of a sudden you just stop out of the flow.

577
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:42,519
Yes, I think that's right.

578
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,840
Or a deer jumps up at you out of the side while you're driving along.

579
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,040
Then the deer is just so beautiful.

580
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,960
It isn't as if you're worried you're going to hit it.

581
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,000
Anyway, I don't think it's, I think we can't say more.

582
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,680
At least, I mean, somebody could say more, but Heidegger doesn't say more.

583
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,960
And that's it.

584
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:06,039
And I think, so there's two puzzles that I know of.

585
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:12,719
In what way are the properties implicit in the interpretive flow all along?

586
00:56:13,439 --> 00:56:16,399
And I think the answer is they aren't, but I'm not sure.

587
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:24,639
And now this one about what gets you switched over out of the unready to hand into the present opinion.

588
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,239
Now, I'm going to go on to the logic part.

589
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:30,239
At least I'm going to finish this today.

590
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:47,600
Now, you can go over the logic part very fast, because what Heidegger says, a lot of stuff you don't have to worry about, which is his arguing with the people in his time, which were interested in validity, and he thinks that validity is a useless sort of concept.

591
00:56:47,919 --> 00:56:49,999
That's the stuff on page 198.

592
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,920
Don't try to understand that.

593
00:56:53,439 --> 00:57:31,359
And then he gets to his story on 201, where he's telling you how you get, you know, once you've got the separate subject and its properties, then you want to know, then you have a problem about how to get them back together again, which is, he says in the middle of 201, right at the bottom of 158, 201, with the progress of knowledge, the little paragraph about the structure of the logos, which is the, oh, by the way, aha, gee, maybe this is important.

594
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:36,239
I skipped the previous paragraph, but maybe this is a very important paragraph.

595
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:45,599
He gives you a paragraph in which he gives you all these sort of intermediate cases of sort of situated and sort of not situated.

596
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,999
And I don't know what he's doing with them, but let's read it.

597
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,559
Because maybe it looks like he might be.

598
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:54,839
You could look in there to see whether he thinks they're breakdowns.

599
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,439
For instance, just I'll jump ahead.

600
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:07,000
In there is kind of a forensic situation where what was normally a kind of involved, you have to stand back and analyze it for the jury or something like that.

601
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:25,799
I think he's telling you all kinds of actual situations in which it's not a question of disturbances or breakdowns, but just all kinds of ways that you go from the involved to the general.

602
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:30,439
And I don't know whether they're matters of degree or what they are, but I'm going to read them because I now think they're relevant.

603
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,719
Tone 201, second paragraph.

604
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:49,160
Between the kind of interpretation which is still wholly wrapped up in concernful understanding, you're just hammering away, and the extreme opposite case of a theoretical assertion about something present at hand, the hammer weighs five pounds.

605
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:59,960
There are many intermediate gradations, assertions about the happenings in the environment, accounts of the ready-to-hand, reports on the situation.

606
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,120
That is, I mean, something like Bert Dreyfus finds the hammer too heavy.

607
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,640
That's going to be some intermediate case, I guess.

608
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,719
The recording and fixing of the facts of the case, that's the forensic one.

609
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:16,120
The description of a state of affairs, the narration of something that's befallen.

610
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,960
Just as I picked up the hammer, I could hardly move my arm.

611
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,520
We cannot track back these sentences to theoretical statements without eventually perverting their meaning.

612
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,999
Like the theoretical statements, they have their source in circumspective interpretation.

613
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,719
Ah, well, that's the punchline.

614
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:43,360
He thinks these are not degrees by which you go from the ready-to-hand and unready-to-hand, the situated to the desituated.

615
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:50,960
They are all inside the hermeneutic involved, if you look at them.

616
00:59:50,960 --> 01:00:02,159
And you can't trace back these assertions to theoretical statements, that is, statements that only talk about the present-at-hand, without losing some of their sense.

617
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,519
Now, you'd have to go over it.

618
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:16,320
Again, it's a possible paper topic to try to check that out, see why each of those is always, always situated and not about the present at hand, even when you're giving the facts of the case to the jury.

619
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,399
And it would be interesting.

620
01:00:18,399 --> 01:00:30,719
But one thing is sure: that this is not the statement that you go by degrees from the hermeneutic to the theoretical, but that there is a big switchover, he thinks.

621
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:35,360
And all of this is on the side of the involved hermeneutic.

622
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,280
So much for that.

623
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:39,120
Now, where were we?

624
01:00:39,279 --> 01:00:42,080
I didn't intend to read it, but I'm glad I did.

625
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,400
So we're talking about the logos now.

626
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,200
And we're in the next paragraph.

627
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:57,040
With the progress of knowledge about the structure of the logos, that is, well, the logic of some sort.

628
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,239
He'll tell you later more about logos next lecture.

629
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:05,759
It was inevitable that this phenomenon of the apophantical as should come into view in some form or other.

630
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:09,279
The manner in which it was approximately seen was not accidental and so forth.

631
01:01:09,279 --> 01:01:20,160
That means that already by the time you get to Aristotle, what they're paying attention to is making assertions about the present-at-hand properties of things.

632
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:28,840
When considered philosophically, the logos is self is an entity, and according to the orientation of ancient ontology, something present at hand.

633
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:30,279
That's just, don't worry about that.

634
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,000
They sort of personify or objectify whatever it is that's going on there.

635
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,839
Words are approximately ready to hand.

636
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:41,559
That is to say, we come across them just as we come across things.

637
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:46,040
And this holds for any sequence of words as that which the logos expresses.

638
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,879
But things are becoming more and more present at hand and desituated.

639
01:01:49,879 --> 01:01:58,519
There are these words, and there are, and the logos is the sort of what you're trying to say, what the meanings of the situation is.

640
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:03,560
And you pick up these words and you put them together into assertions.

641
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:10,680
In this first search for the structure of the logos, as present at hand, was found the being at hand together of several words.

642
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,920
What establishes the unity of this?

643
01:02:12,919 --> 01:02:21,400
Well, let me make an aside here, which I don't think will interest very many of you, but it's not something I know much about.

644
01:02:21,399 --> 01:02:27,000
But he's, you get a problem of the unity of the proposition.

645
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:38,360
Russell worries about how the words, sort of this, I don't know, apple is red, what unifies the apple and the is and the red.

646
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:42,120
And I think he couldn't, I think he thought it was insoluble.

647
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:53,880
And there was somehow they couldn't figure out how to understand why the proposition was just sort of clobbered together out of three disparate notions.

648
01:02:53,879 --> 01:03:14,559
And I think Heidegger thinks, and I bet somewhere in his logic lectures, which are he made lots of courses on logic, he must think that in the background, it's because this apple is red, grew out of a hermeneutic situated way of thinking about the apple, and then it got desituated into the present-at-hand.

649
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:26,080
We still can experience it as a unity, but the unity is in the background, and it's been left out of the foreground where all you've got is present-at-hand notions.

650
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:33,600
And you can't understand the unity of the present-at-hand notions once you've left out so much, I think.

651
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:41,600
So, and then Plato has to deal with the unity, and everybody has to deal with the unity, and finally they think it's a question of binding together somehow.

652
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:46,320
And finally, in the middle of 202, you get to thinking of it as a calculus.

653
01:03:46,879 --> 01:03:48,399
This is the predicate calculus.

654
01:03:48,399 --> 01:03:52,639
We're finally getting to logic, as you know it, and have to take a course in it.

655
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,719
The middle of 202, binding and separating may be formalized still further.

656
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:01,680
I've jumped over a few stages of formalizing to a relating.

657
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:10,879
The judgment gets disclosed logistically into a system, dissolved, sorry, logistically into a system in which things are coordinated with one another.

658
01:04:10,879 --> 01:04:13,040
It becomes the object of a calculus.

659
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:26,080
Now you've got these elements, and you can just put them together in all sorts of ways, and it's all completely formal, and there's no more reference to the background out of which it came.

660
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,680
And that's what Heidegger calls logistic there.

661
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:38,079
And so I have to say an aside now that Heidegger liked the predicate calculus in a certain way.

662
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:48,640
He wrote three papers reviewing Russell and Whitehead's Principia, which was this very important formalization of logic.

663
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:59,799
And he thought it was fine, except, and then he said, in the third article, in the third review, he said, yes, it's in effect, he showed he understood it.

664
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:03,640
He showed that it was powerful and interesting to try to formalize.

665
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,399
How much does Principia try to formalize?

666
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,279
Math too?

667
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:06,839
First order?

668
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:07,640
Or just logic?

669
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,759
Math, I think.

670
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:09,480
I think.

671
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:18,600
But anyway, whatever it was, but in the end, in his review, he said, but it's just logistics, meaning the same thing as this logistical here.

672
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:35,000
It's left behind any account of by what steps you could get to it from our ordinary experience, so that you could understand how it was unified and how it was intelligible.

673
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And so he finds it ultimately uninteresting because he's interested in what we've been talking about today, not the formal result, but what has to be left out in order to get the formal result.

674
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,679
And why is that important?

675
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,279
Well, that's important.

676
01:05:52,279 --> 01:05:55,080
And now we're back to where I began a whole two lectures ago.

677
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,039
Who would have thought?

678
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:25,480
That you could, once you see what's left out, you don't make the mistake of John McCarthy at Stanford, who founded artificial intelligence, which was the idea that when you've got this formal system of a whole lot of subjects with a whole lot of predicates and relational predicates and monadic and dynamic and triadic predicates, when you get all that worked out, that you could then describe an ordinary human situation so as to capture the meaning of it and thereby be able to make computers intelligent.

679
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,480
You will see, that's what I saw when I read this, that's not going to work.

680
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,000
And it didn't work.

681
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:40,159
And I think that's because once you see that how you don't, logic isn't what was there all along, and the smart logicians have just found it.

682
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:47,679
Logic is what's there when you leave out situatedness, and once you leave it out, you can't get it done.

683
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:50,160
That's the moral.

684
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,439
Okay, I still got, if anybody wants to say anything, that's fine.

685
01:06:53,439 --> 01:06:58,960
But if you don't, I'm going to go on to at least tell you enough about the discourse chapter that will help you understand it.

686
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:07,119
But I certainly, I don't know whether you regret that I've fallen into this hole, but I don't regret it.

687
01:07:07,759 --> 01:07:12,239
I think I finally see what Hey's talking about here better than I ever did.

688
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:25,759
But anyway, let's go on because it helps to understand that the discourse chapter is so hard to understand, basically because the discourse, the word for discourse in German is just plain Reda.

689
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:28,639
Discourse is too fancy.

690
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,159
Rada just means talk in German.

691
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,000
I think that's all it can mean.

692
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,040
Is that right, Eugene?

693
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,640
So there's no other use for Rada.

694
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,080
It just means talk.

695
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:53,680
Now, that's peculiar, because if you try to translate the chapter 34 on page 203, being there and talk, then you wonder what it must be.

696
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,599
Then you think it must be about language.

697
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,880
You can't talk without words and language.

698
01:07:58,879 --> 01:08:04,560
And yet, oddly enough, it turns out it's not just about language.

699
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:10,399
It turns out that it's something like the conditions of the possibility of there being language.

700
01:08:10,399 --> 01:08:12,080
And that's what we have to go into.

701
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,160
So let's start in 203.

702
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:27,639
The fundamental, just to give you the whole picture, the fundamental existentialia, which constitute the being of the there, the disclosiveness of being in the world, are disposedness and understanding.

703
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:33,880
And then those get spelled out in discourse.

704
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:45,239
The clearest statement, just jump to page 400, because I don't think he says it anywhere up to 400 as simply and clearly as he does there, if I can find it there now.

705
01:08:45,239 --> 01:08:47,239
Am I really want 400?

706
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:47,799
Yeah?

707
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:48,599
Okay.

708
01:08:48,599 --> 01:08:54,439
And under the temporality of discourse, the middle of 400, page 349 in the German.

709
01:08:54,439 --> 01:09:04,439
When the there has been completely disclosed, its disclosedness is constituted by understanding, disposedness, and falling, that's being absorbed.

710
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:09,799
And this disclosedness receives its articulation from discourse.

711
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:17,879
And now, articulation is a kind of pun, which is behind all of this hard to understand thing.

712
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:31,959
So I'm going to tell you that there has to be, no, I need one step before I get to, but somehow, rada talk, is the, makes possible talk.

713
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:33,399
That is language.

714
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:36,200
Now, that's what I'm trying to tell you about.

715
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,719
Where it says 161 in the margin on 203.

716
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:46,919
The existential foundation of language is discourse or talk.

717
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:49,719
Now, that's the peculiar thing.

718
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:57,639
That is, there's something which is more basic than language and talking, which he also calls talk.

719
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,479
And I'll tell you two things to help you understand that.

720
01:10:01,479 --> 01:10:08,879
First, you make a pun about articulating, which I don't think he can do in German, but he may, Eugene can tell me.

721
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:13,679
But anyway, or you, but I mean, what I want to say is a skeleton can be articulated.

722
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,160
It's a perfect lecture for Halloween.

723
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:21,040
There is, I mean, all the joints are articulated.

724
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,719
And that's nice.

725
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:30,799
And those articulated joints can be articulated in the sense that they can be named.

726
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,160
That is, that's another meaning we have for articulation.

727
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:37,839
That is, it's putting into words.

728
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,999
And Heidegger wants to have both.

729
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:54,479
He wants to make his notion talk name the basic articulation of the world, where it's joints, so to speak, that it has joints, and name the way we put those joints into words.

730
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:57,599
And he's doing this sort of double job.

731
01:10:57,599 --> 01:11:01,599
So then I just want to, I'll jump ahead because I want you to have the overall picture.

732
01:11:01,599 --> 01:11:05,839
What are the joints that can be put into words?

733
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:13,359
What is the more sort of basic form of talk, which isn't even really talk, but is the condition of the possibility of talk?

734
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:18,959
Well, you find out way back on 2.

735
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,880
I'm going to jump ahead, so I need to find out.

736
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,040
It's something like 221.

737
01:11:24,639 --> 01:11:26,719
Yeah, 121.

738
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,279
And it's very simple, really.

739
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,759
At the top of 121, in German, at the bottom of 87.

740
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:54,839
Okay, but in significance itself, with which Dasein is always familiar, there lurks the ontological condition which makes it possible for Dasein as something which understands and interprets to disclose such things as significations.

741
01:11:55,239 --> 01:11:56,999
What would be a signification?

742
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:04,200
Well, it's that the purpose of electron is to hold my papers.

743
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,359
That's part of the referential totality.

744
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:15,160
The significations are all the four watts and towards which is, which are all interrelated in the referential totality.

745
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:21,639
And the referential totality has nodes in it, lecterns and tables and papers, and they're all connected.

746
01:12:21,639 --> 01:12:24,200
And they all, you know, serve each other.

747
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,120
And what happens there?

748
01:12:26,439 --> 01:12:31,160
Well, there are these significations, in German bedeutungen.

749
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,239
Upon these is founded the being of words and of language.

750
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,799
Way back there is when he says it.

751
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,679
And what is that?

752
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:40,279
And what is he saying there?

753
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:47,319
He's saying that to these nodes you can name the nodes.

754
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:50,439
I can call this electron in these papers and that table.

755
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:53,719
But you don't have names for all the nodes now, but you can always name them.

756
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,599
There'll be new nodes, and there will be new names.

757
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:03,319
And to these significations, words accrue.

758
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:05,639
Now I have to find that quote jumping ahead.

759
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:08,759
That's the other half of that.

760
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,999
204.

761
01:13:12,359 --> 01:13:20,599
He lays it down there, but he nails it where he wants it back here back in the discourse chapter.

762
01:13:20,599 --> 01:13:31,160
The crucial move is at the end of the top paragraph, not full top paragraph, the middle of the page.

763
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,279
So I'm going to start with the third line on page 204.

764
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,599
That which gets articulated as such is discursive articulation.

765
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,639
See, skeletons don't talk, they just got joints.

766
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:51,200
But discursive articulation, we name them.

767
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:57,279
And this discursive articulation, we call the totality of significations.

768
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:07,279
Wait, that which gets articulated in a discursive articulation when we talk is the totality of significations, namely lecterns, tables, papers, and so forth.

769
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:15,359
Significations as what has been articulated from that which can be articulated always carry a meaning.

770
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:16,879
Well, that's fine.

771
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:33,759
If discourse is the articulation of intelligibility of the there is a primordial existentiale of disclosedness, and if disclosedness primarily constituted by being in the world, then discourse too must have a kind of being which is specifically worldly.

772
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,679
And now comes this crucial sentence again.

773
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:46,319
The intelligibility of being in the world, an intelligibility that goes with state of mind and so forth, expresses itself as discourse.

774
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:55,920
That is, there's already intelligibility, there are already joints in the referential totality, and we can name them, and then we express it as discourse.

775
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,439
And here's the punchline.

776
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:01,839
The totality of significations of intelligibility is put into words.

777
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:08,559
The significations, words accrue, but word things do not get supplied with significance.

778
01:15:08,559 --> 01:15:12,879
Well, there's a whole story, a whole view of language in there.

779
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,559
First, you've got to have a referential totality, and you can have it without language.

780
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:21,999
I think of it sort of the eighth in 2001.

781
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:30,999
He throws up this stick in the air, and he's got something like a piece of equipment, but he has named it a club.

782
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:40,279
And then he gets in a referential totality where he knows where to put it and how to use it, and it goes with bigger sticks and littler sticks and so forth.

783
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:44,519
And then he can come along and name it a club.

784
01:15:44,519 --> 01:15:47,160
But it's already got to be there.

785
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,879
It's already got to be significant.

786
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,439
But it works better in German.

787
01:15:52,439 --> 01:15:54,919
It has to have bedeutsangkeit.

788
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,479
And then you can single out the nodes.

789
01:15:57,479 --> 01:15:59,239
And those are bedeutungen.

790
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:00,999
Those are significances.

791
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,879
And then you can put a word on them, like club.

792
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,599
And of course, my example is both good and bad.

793
01:16:06,599 --> 01:16:17,399
It's a good example to say that you can have a meaningful piece of equipment without any words yet and name it later, which is what Heidegger thinks.

794
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:23,160
But of course, it's a bad example in that it only really works when you've got a whole referential totality.

795
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,319
You can't just name a club according to Heidegger.

796
01:16:27,319 --> 01:16:37,479
You've got to see it as one joint in the club holders, club cleaners, club whatever, stores, and so forth.

797
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:40,519
When you get them all laid out, then you can name them all.

798
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,799
And time is up.

799
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:53,639
So if anybody wants to quickly say anything, if not, this is not a very long chapter, and I've sort of given you the heart of it already.

800
01:16:53,639 --> 01:17:02,999
So I will spend at most half the time next time on discourse, and we'll catch up because I will then go on to falling.
