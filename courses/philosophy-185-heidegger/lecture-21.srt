1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Now, what I hope to do is finish talking about discourse today and begin talking about falling.

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:11,521
And then that leaves us one lecture behind still.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,761
So I hope to finish falling on Tuesday.

4
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:18,641
So read the falling part.

5
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:23,920
And remember, there's this part to skip, which I will just put back on the board.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:34,161
So for next week, oh, no, for next, well, you've already supposedly read for this time already up to where we are.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,400
So I want you to continue to go because we're going to get to this.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,840
Well, no, I know.

9
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,800
I hope to get to starting this Thursday, that's what I'm trying to say.

10
00:00:44,801 --> 00:01:08,760
The next Thursday, we're going to get 224 to 241, and we're going to skip the anxiety part, which is 228 to 235, and 241 to 244.

11
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:14,280
Okay, that's, can you see that?

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,041
I'm sort of in the way of it.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,440
So that, now, let's go back to where we were.

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,440
We're finishing talk, the discourse part.

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:35,000
And I keep trying to tell myself and tell you, because I really find it such a crazy thing to get a grip on just this terminology.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,321
Why is he calling this the talk?

17
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:45,160
And when he is calling it talk, then there's several different kinds of something or other that falls under talk.

18
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,601
Some of it involves words, and sometimes it doesn't, and so forth.

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,920
So let me try to sort it out again.

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:59,560
I think there is something, and this may not be right, but I've got to keep trying, and then you can come to office hours and tell me why it's wrong, and then we'll all learn something.

21
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:17,240
But there is, Heidegger has a kind of methodological idea, which is not very good, that when he wants to call the condition of the possibility of something primordial something.

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,641
You'll see the main ones when you get to truth.

23
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:25,480
He's got a notion of primordial truth that makes ordinary correspondence truth possible.

24
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:32,600
When you get to time, he's got a notion of temporality that's supposed to make ordinary time possible.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:40,761
And when he does talk about it under temporality, he says you can name the more powerful thing by what it makes possible.

26
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,521
And that's in Latin, he says that.

27
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:47,160
That must be somewhere, some philosopher has said it.

28
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:56,720
So I think maybe we can say that he's got a notion of primordial talk, and that's not words and people speaking.

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:26,480
That's, remember we got there last time, that's the fact that the referential totality is articulated, that has joints, and therefore, because of that primordial structure of articulated articulated structure, that makes possible talking when words, because you can name the joints.

30
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
So maybe that's what he's up to.

31
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,400
We know that ordinary talk is founded on what we might want to call primordial talk on 204.

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,721
And maybe that would help just sort out these two.

33
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,320
There's no doubt that he's got two different things here.

34
00:03:50,641 --> 00:04:03,761
So he says on 204, the second paragraph, as an existential state in which Dasein is disclosed, this course is constitutive of Dasein's existence.

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,721
I guess I've got to read that.

36
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:17,440
The Dasein is disclosed as a disclosure of the referential totality of significance and all these joints.

37
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:22,800
It doesn't fit the text too well, but that seems to be what I'm going to believes, that's what he thinks.

38
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:26,720
Discourse is constitutive for Dasein's existence.

39
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,720
But that doesn't mean talking yet, because he says hearing and keeping silent are possibilities belonging to discursive speech.

40
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,681
That's, I think, talking words.

41
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:45,720
In these phenomena, the constitutive functions of discourse for the existentiality of existence becomes entirely plain for the first time.

42
00:04:46,040 --> 00:05:00,921
Well, that seems to me something like the claim that this articulation of the joints becomes changed into speaking articulation.

43
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:17,400
And speaking articulation makes that, makes Dasein's job as an articulator, both of the referential totality with its joints, its nodes or whatever, and of the being that can name them.

44
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,641
That's how I'm going to think about it anyway.

45
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm going to say primordial ontological talk carves up the world into affordances or whatever, joints, whatever, like doors and windows and lecterns, has solicitations to do this or to do that.

46
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,400
And we can then name them and talk about them.

47
00:05:46,840 --> 00:06:04,361
So another way, now to just talk about the phenomena, another way to put it, which I can understand better, because it's always better to have a phenomenon, as we develop skills, we can disclose all kinds of distinctions, which we don't have at first.

48
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:14,121
Remember this, that, and these distinctions that we get as we require skills show up in the world as things looking different.

49
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:27,280
I mean, the usual example is the Merleau-Ponty example, a city looks more and more full of distinctions like turn right for the bakery and turn left for the laundry and so forth as you get to know it.

50
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,921
A better example here would be imagine that a surgeon has a skill for cutting in many, many different ways.

51
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:42,001
Many more than we've got names for, or that anybody's got names for.

52
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:53,041
But as he acquires more and more skill, he articulates the domain of cuttable bodies more into more and more distinctions.

53
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,040
And they're not ineffable.

54
00:06:55,281 --> 00:07:02,001
Heidegger doesn't think that there's anything of these distinctions and nodes that you can't name.

55
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,641
So if the surgeon wants to teach how to make a new kind of operation, he can name the way he cuts.

56
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,921
And then he articulates the discriminations, which is my new word here for articulations.

57
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:16,961
It's the same thing.

58
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:22,641
He articulates the discriminations that he can make of various kinds of cutting.

59
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:33,600
There is something, just to get clear where I stand, and I'm sure Heidegger too, there is something that can't be put into words, which is in a certain way ineffable.

60
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,681
And that's the skill itself.

61
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:48,961
That you can't program the skill the surgeon exercises when he looks at the tissue and can see that this is cuttable that way and this should be cut that way and so forth.

62
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:53,681
He sees all these distinctions that his experience has given him.

63
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,001
His experience has given him skills.

64
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,881
His skills show up in the in the in the world as distinct-looking, different tissue in the body.

65
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,240
And those different distinct tissues in the body show up.

66
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:09,001
Oh, that reminds me, that's a funny story.

67
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,720
I tell you a story to make this clear.

68
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:16,281
My brother and I, two funny stories.

69
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:16,840
Okay.

70
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:25,721
Both from our days when we worked for the Air Force doing the phenomenology of skills.

71
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,281
There were two amazing moments.

72
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:33,241
One was, there was, and it was sort of like Dr.

73
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:48,840
Strangelove or something, there was a famous, I guess, lieutenant colonel or some rather high character who had been the best tank commander in Vietnam and had won all the medals and so forth.

74
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:57,481
And he was getting old, and he was convinced that if they got an expert system that could do what he did, then they could install it in the tanks.

75
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:08,281
And after he died, he would still be fighting all the battles and winning all the battles because his expertise, his skill, would have been captured in this expert system in the tank.

76
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,721
And my brother and I were trying to tell him, no, I'm afraid we're sorry you can't do that.

77
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,081
And he said, oh, it's easy, let me explain.

78
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,360
And he lived up on a sort of mountain with walls around him.

79
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,840
And he said, come out here, I'll show you.

80
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,840
When you're on a hill like that, you should, that's the kind of hill you should put the tank on.

81
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,040
And we looked and it was completely flat as far as we could see.

82
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,721
There wasn't any hill at all.

83
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:42,361
But I'm sure if we'd had enough experience of years of time, he obviously could discriminate levels that we couldn't even see.

84
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:47,481
And we told him, we're sorry, we can't capture that in an expert system.

85
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,921
He was very unhappy about that.

86
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,880
And that was the end.

87
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,721
That was all we had to do with him.

88
00:09:53,681 --> 00:10:06,720
Which is just as well, because he was really sort of like what's the name of Lieutenant in Apocalypse Now, Pildore, is that his name?

89
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Who loves the smell of napalm in the morning?

90
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,680
I think that's this guy.

91
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:10,480
Yes, yes.

92
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,321
When we were told to talk to him, we said, and don't talk politics with him.

93
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,000
His politics is to the right of Attila the Hun.

94
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,840
And so we got out of there as quickly as we could.

95
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:36,880
But I remember now, as I was telling you this, another one, maybe I told you this already, about where some, where the fact that you can't capture the skills in words was dramatically shown to my brother.

96
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,721
I wasn't there on this occasion.

97
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:57,921
Another tank thing, we were involved with the tanks, and that there was a what do you call it, a battle, a mock battle, in which my brother was in one of the tanks, and the tank leader got the tank up on a hill that everybody could actually see.

98
00:10:57,921 --> 00:11:03,201
And he had a beautiful view of the whole battlefield, and he could shoot at any tank he wanted of the enemy.

99
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:06,561
And bong, of course, his tank was shot out from under him.

100
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:12,721
And there was an old sergeant who'd had lots of experience.

101
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,801
And the lieutenant turned to him and said, What happened?

102
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:22,961
And he said, Well, you put the tank where you could see everything, but of course, everybody could see you.

103
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,680
And he said, Well, what should I have done?

104
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:27,921
How can I recognize where I should put it?

105
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,840
And you haven't heard the story?

106
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,441
And then the sergeant said, I can't give you no fucking formula.

107
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:35,321
You'll know when you see one.

108
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:40,760
And that's the part of it that can't be put into words.

109
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:45,001
And okay, now back to where we were.

110
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,241
So, where are we?

111
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,641
Let's see.

112
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:48,681
Okay, yeah.

113
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,601
And so now, why call the capacity to see these distinctions talk?

114
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Well, as I say, you could only call it talk since it hasn't got words by thinking of it as primordial talk.

115
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,001
It's what makes talk possible is that there are these discriminations that people are able to make.

116
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,641
And that takes you back to page 56, which is another clue of a different sort, but important too.

117
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:29,641
The second paragraph on 56, when fully concrete, discoursing, letting something be seen, that's the more basic kind.

118
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:32,921
That's just pointing things out at their joints.

119
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:34,281
I guess there's three things.

120
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:36,361
Oh, dear, I thought I only had two.

121
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,801
There's the referential totality is articulated.

122
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,321
It has joints.

123
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:44,680
You can articulate it by pointing out the joints.

124
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,001
We don't have to use words.

125
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:53,401
You can just watch what the surgeon does.

126
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,360
Or you can, oh, and I remember another story.

127
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,880
This is a very short one.

128
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,520
There's a famous Danish auto-mechanic, apparently.

129
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:14,840
I was working for the Danish skilled people at that point, who apparently doesn't say any word ever to his assistants as he, and they watch him, they're apprentices, and they watch him work on cars.

130
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:21,840
And after they've spent enough years watching him work on cars, they're the best auto-methanics too in Denmark.

131
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:32,001
And I presume that's because he could point out, and what does this say, let them see the important distinctions in, say, motors and carburetors and stuff.

132
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,361
But he doesn't have to proclaim it into words.

133
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,401
But it can be put into words.

134
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,360
And I wonder, Adam, I need help with the Greek.

135
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,881
I was going to ask you before, but I just got back from a trip in time to get here.

136
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,681
So tell me what this says.

137
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:03,441
Okay, logos is one, which means he talks.

138
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,641
Aha.

139
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,120
Okay.

140
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,561
Voiced, yeah.

141
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:19,761
And phone meta fantasias is, well, he says utterance or something voiced that has, that is with an appearance or something sighted.

142
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,361
Let something be seen.

143
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,321
Okay, that's.

144
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,480
Very, very, well, but he makes, it's his story.

145
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:33,681
That the logos then, it becomes concrete.

146
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:36,081
That's the part I really want in speech.

147
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,720
I just wanted to make sure that I didn't disagree with what was happening in the Greek.

148
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,441
And notice the concrete talk.

149
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,800
Doesn't that remind you of how the Finnlichkeit, that is, disposedness, becomes concrete in moods?

150
00:14:50,800 --> 00:15:06,921
So there always is this more abstract capacity, which is receptivity when it's disposedness, which gets its kind of best paradigm, fullest expression as something or other.

151
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:17,640
So disposedness, receptivity gets its best, fullest sort of paradigm expression in moods, though we talked about how there could be other things than moods.

152
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:20,280
Somebody gave me good ones in office hours.

153
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,720
Anybody remember?

154
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,520
Didn't we have sort of emotions, but other things too, than even emotions?

155
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,681
Anyway, you can imagine, I said love would be one of them.

156
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,280
Love isn't a mood, but it's part of receptivity.

157
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,880
And I'm sure there are lots of affects, maybe we should call them, which aren't moods.

158
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:45,401
And so the broad category takes into account all sorts of stuff.

159
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:50,121
But then it becomes concrete or manifest at its best in something.

160
00:15:50,441 --> 00:16:00,201
So this capacity we've got for pointing out the joints becomes concrete or manifest or works at its best when we name them.

161
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:02,040
And that seems all right.

162
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,921
I'm just trying to get these two layers sorted out.

163
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,760
Now let's see if I want to say anything more.

164
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,161
So I just said it again in my notes.

165
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:18,760
I think I shouldn't say things over and over too often or they turn too much.

166
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,441
So let me skip this for a minute.

167
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:44,681
So I just want to say it's at each case you ought to be able to find a primordial ontological structural capacity which makes ontic everyday s something or other, is realized in or concrete in everyday something or other.

168
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:57,441
And whether it's truth or discourse or what was the other one, temporality, and there are others too, the Heidegger's always got these two levels.

169
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:04,961
I think maybe understanding is this a primordial capacity to press into possibilities.

170
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:06,240
And there's only one.

171
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,681
This I haven't ever said that I think Eugene pointed out to me.

172
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:22,560
Remember I had two notions of understanding, primary, which was pressing into possibilities just everyday coping, and primordial, which was understanding taking a stand on your being.

173
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:25,760
But I think that's I was convinced that's wrong now.

174
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
It's all pressing into possibilities.

175
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:41,040
But there's a whole spectrum of pressing into possibilities from the most basic, going out to go out, and to the most complicated, taking a stand by giving yourself an identity.

176
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:50,480
And those would be two ways that primordial understanding as pressing into possibilities, which is very general, becomes concrete.

177
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:53,281
And I don't know which is the paradigm.

178
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:57,840
One of them, you could think of them either one as the paradigm.

179
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
And the primary Heidegger means that's the really the most basic one.

180
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,520
And the other one is the taking a stand, which is, and he calls it primordial.

181
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:15,120
And I guess, if you had to think about it, the taking a stand is what makes you gives your coping a point.

182
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:29,280
And it's it that kind of understanding, namely sort of who you are and what you're up to, is the paradigm most most developed, most concrete, I'm just guessing, kind of understanding.

183
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,720
But and I keep trying to get that.

184
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:37,641
Whenever I get this finally figured out, I give you a chart which is all settled, but it isn't settled in my head yet.

185
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:50,201
And so now, primordial articulation becomes concrete in talk, which points out articulations to now comes a new move to other people.

186
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:53,640
What's the special feature of words?

187
00:18:53,641 --> 00:19:13,720
Well, again, with the Danish auto mechanic, you could get along without them, but they do help a lot to make the distinctions shared, that enable people to learn to share the things that you distinguish and care about.

188
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,520
And so speech has this special role.

189
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:21,480
I don't think he thinks that it has to do this.

190
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,841
I mean, that would be nice if he did, but I think he's right.

191
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:28,520
The phenomena doesn't say that you have to use words.

192
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,801
I get you can get a lot.

193
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:37,240
How far you could get without words is an interesting question, because animals get a long way without any words at all.

194
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,920
And children before the age of two have lots of discriminations and can point out things and so forth.

195
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:52,360
But certainly, the way public intelligibility works is that there has to be finally a shared language.

196
00:19:52,361 --> 00:20:00,040
And that's what he's saying on 205, where he says, where he talks about communication in the middle of the page.

197
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,400
The second line in the middle paragraph, page 162 in the journal.

198
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,880
Communication, in which one makes assertions, giving information, for examples.

199
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:18,441
A special case of the communication which is grasped in principle existentially.

200
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:29,840
So it's part of the existential structure of articulation or discourse that it works for communication.

201
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:36,560
In this more general kind of communication, the articulation of being with one another understandingly is constituted.

202
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:46,880
That is, you can't get very far, he thinks, and I'm sure it's right, socially having a shared understanding and a shared world if you weren't able to talk.

203
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:57,360
Through it, that is, talk, a co-state of mind, that is, co-disposedness, gets shared, and so does the understanding of being with.

204
00:20:57,681 --> 00:21:18,240
And it's important that you can get a shared understanding beyond just that you understand something like the flower story from Sesame Street, where only without the flowers in the brain, I can point out a flower and you can see the flower.

205
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,400
That's the first level.

206
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:25,681
But it's important also that we're able to share that it's shared.

207
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:27,441
Charles Taylor has written about this.

208
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:37,040
You have to think about, say, a party in which there's a joyful mood, and you're feeling joyful, and I'm feeling joyful, and everybody in the party is feeling joyful.

209
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:44,961
But it's another whole level when everybody in the party realizes that everybody in the party shares that mood of being joyful.

210
00:21:45,280 --> 00:22:14,441
And that's really, I think, where you've got to bring in language, is that there's a world in which there are symbols which could be works of art, could be poems, could be speeches like the Gettysburg Address, where people all share what it is that they all share, what their community believes and so forth.

211
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:17,401
And I think that's what he's talking about at the end of that paragraph.

212
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:22,841
Communication is never anything like conveying an experience from one interior to another.

213
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,800
You know, that's the Sesame Street version.

214
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,000
That's the wrong version.

215
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:35,400
The Ezein with is essentially manifest in a co-state of mind, a co-understanding, and discourse being with becomes explicitly shared.

216
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,720
That's the highest thing you can do with it.

217
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,641
That is to say, it is already shared.

218
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:43,320
See, everybody's a party, and the party's already joyful.

219
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,720
But it is unshared as something that has not been taken hold of and appropriated.

220
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,480
That is, it can be just in fact shared.

221
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,600
Or, thanks to language, you can all recognize and agree that you share it.

222
00:22:56,921 --> 00:23:14,601
Somebody who's a big baseball fan, I'm not, so I can't tell you the phenomenon firsthand, but he says there's this special thrill when somebody does something really terrific and everybody stands up, and it's part of the thrill that everybody knows that everybody else is being thrilled in exactly the same way at the same time.

223
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,840
That's the shared that it's shared.

224
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:20,600
And there, you don't do it with language.

225
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:28,921
But the general job of language is to help people communicate that what's going on is shared.

226
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:31,080
That's what I think about that.

227
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:38,681
And now it becomes, that's all that is sort of okay, but not very, I mean, I don't know.

228
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:45,480
I think it's, you've gotta see, if you spell it out like Taylor does about the importance of sharing that it's shared and how it works.

229
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,480
I think there's probably deep things in here, but it doesn't connect up any much with anything else.

230
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:58,480
And it isn't anything really surprising or important about language in the end, I'm afraid, that he's saying.

231
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,240
Now, I wouldn't dare say that about Heidegger if it wasn't that Heidegger himself says it about Heidegger.

232
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,120
There's something sort of unsatisfactory about the language thing.

233
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:15,760
And I've probably been showing it by my sort of struggle to talk about it.

234
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:28,401
But he says it explicitly on 206 that he hasn't done the job of really understanding the being of language.

235
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,761
He says at the end of the first full paragraph, down a ways on page 163.

236
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,921
On 206, he says, we would, where will I start?

237
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:46,001
Even if one were to put the various fragmentary definitions of language together, nothing would be achieved in the way of a full, adequate definition of language.

238
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:59,121
We would still have to do what is decisive here, to work out in advance the ontologico-existential whole of the structure of discourse on the basis of the analytic of Dasein.

239
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:07,121
See, that's what you think he was sort of doing, but he hasn't, but he isn't doing it very clearly or very well, and he knows he isn't.

240
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:12,400
He doesn't even, and this is interesting, understand the being of language, he says.

241
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:39,240
That means that in all the stuff I've been talking about, articulating, which is important, all right, for which language is certainly important, all right, he doesn't ask himself whether language is an instrument ready, is some kind of instrument ready to hand for pointing out shared things, or is language a present-at-hand entity, a bunch of words and grammatical rules for putting them together?

242
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:46,121
Or does language have some third kind of being, which is more like the being of Dasein?

243
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:50,681
He says this on, he asks this on 209, but he doesn't answer it.

244
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:05,000
So the bottom of 209, the last paragraph, when 166 is German.

245
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,760
In the last resort, philosophical research must resolve to ask what kind of being goes with language in general.

246
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,520
Is it a kind of equipment ready to hand, or has it got Dasein's kind of being, or neither of these?

247
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:27,641
And the interesting thing is that in the end, it looks in being in time mostly the way I've explained it, and I think I was following it.

248
00:26:27,641 --> 00:26:39,240
It looks like an instrument for articulating the joints and pointing out the joints and pointing out the shared, pointing out that we share in seeing things.

249
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:50,201
And yet, when Heidegger, and that's probably what the view in here is, but Heidegger knows that he's not satisfied with that, that there's lots about language he hasn't captured.

250
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:50,840
Yeah.

251
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:56,280
Even though we have a developer, it does need sense to be developed.

252
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,640
I mean, he said at one point, he presupposes out of everything so far, and they sort of subtract it.

253
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,240
That's right.

254
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,360
But he doesn't develop it.

255
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:13,160
If being in the world is being within a referential hole, reference is already something.

256
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,000
Ah.

257
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:16,201
No.

258
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:22,640
Yes and no, but I mean, that's just a kind of pun.

259
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,201
Wait a minute.

260
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:26,641
I mean, the referential whole isn't really reference.

261
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:34,320
I mean, it's, you know, it's the way the lectern refers to the table.

262
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,161
It's not a linguistic kind of reference, and that's already the referential totalities.

263
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,600
It's not really language either.

264
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:49,281
Okay, but reference really is, though.

265
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:57,360
I mean, the referential whole isn't about linguistic reference, and he doesn't have any other kind of reference.

266
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:58,480
I mean, I mean, I'm not.

267
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:08,641
Why should he need to language?

268
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:10,161
That's what I don't understand.

269
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:12,240
Are you saying he should tell us that?

270
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,081
But it's so sub-linguistic the way tables relate to you.

271
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:19,681
No.

272
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:20,480
Okay, he does.

273
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,520
He does, but I see.

274
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,480
Well, he good.

275
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,601
But he doesn't.

276
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:26,480
I agree with you.

277
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,040
But the funny thing about that is he never does, and I think it's impossible.

278
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,561
I mean, it's rock bottom.

279
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:45,040
But what you're saying is, how can we, how is he going to tell us, what does he have to tell us about the phenomenon of way the lectern refers to the table and the table refers to the floor and so forth?

280
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,560
What more can he say?

281
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,760
Well, he could say a little.

282
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,120
It's all familiar.

283
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:51,121
And you have to have familiarity.

284
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:52,881
They don't just sit around referring.

285
00:28:52,881 --> 00:29:02,800
It's only when you understand how they all deal function with each other that you understand the referential totality.

286
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,080
That's fine.

287
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,881
But what more can he do?

288
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:08,921
If you know Curtis what more, you can say, I'd love to hear you.

289
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:12,840
He says he doesn't want to deal with negatives.

290
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:14,280
He postpones that discussion.

291
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,120
He doesn't want to talk about the longest status.

292
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:20,600
Because he doesn't know what to say.

293
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,921
That's right.

294
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:28,361
He knows dimly.

295
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,121
This is not so mysterious.

296
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:38,760
I can finish what I know dimly that there's something more and something important about language which he doesn't know what to say yet.

297
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:51,640
And now I can tell you, and that's why I'm telling you this, that he kept a copy of Being in Time in his ski hut in the Black Forest where he went to write his stuff.

298
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,360
And there are marginal notes, a lot of them in it.

299
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,480
Did I ever mention that?

300
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,560
If I didn't, I think I may have.

301
00:29:58,201 --> 00:30:03,480
I think I remember myself saying in the Jones-Stanbaugh translation, the marginal notes are translated.

302
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:17,000
And for that very reason, I got a copy of the Jones-Stanbaugh translation and put it in Howison Library in case you want to look at whatever marginal notes he might have written about whatever paragraphs you might want to write about.

303
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,161
But there's a very, and he seldom, I only know two places where he says in the marginal notes he was wrong.

304
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:27,240
And one of them is about language.

305
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,080
And so I'm going to read you what he says at the top of 121.

306
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:43,560
He's talking about this crucial story about articulation that I already talked about.

307
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,921
And I read this passage last time, I think, the top of 121.

308
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,441
In the German, it's woo, the very bottom of 87.

309
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:55,761
And he says, remember in the second paragraph, or the first full paragraph.

310
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:08,560
But in significance itself, with which Dasein is always familiar, there works an ontological condition which makes it possible for Dasein as something which understands and interprets to disclose such things as signification.

311
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,401
Upon these, in turn, is founded the being of words and of language.

312
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:14,560
That's the whole story I've been telling you.

313
00:31:14,881 --> 00:31:17,201
That's the story he tells it here.

314
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,921
But he writes in the margin, not true.

315
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:23,441
Language is not tiered, layered.

316
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:28,161
Rather, language is the primordial essence of the truth of the there.

317
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,841
Now, that's pretty mysterious.

318
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:36,320
But what he wants to say is: language really discloses the clearing.

319
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:44,161
That it thanks to language, the world shows up, I think, as having a certain style.

320
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,561
Maybe, and yeah.

321
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,721
Oh, yeah, okay.

322
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:52,401
I don't remember how Joan Stanbaugh translates it, but I translate it.

323
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:55,441
Language, he certainly says not true.

324
00:31:55,441 --> 00:32:00,161
Then he says, language is not layered or tiered.

325
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:13,921
You get the picture, the tiered layer, the tiered story, the layer story, is, well, there are these referential totalities at the bottom, and they have, it has nodes, and on top of those nodes, you add words.

326
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:15,840
That's the wrong thing.

327
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:18,480
He says it's not tiered.

328
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,160
It is the primordial essence of the truth of the there.

329
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:26,880
That's pretty, I mean, weird talk.

330
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:30,241
Yes, that's later, Heidegger.

331
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:30,801
Exactly.

332
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,680
That's Later Heidegger going back and writing in the margin.

333
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And this is why he sensed he hadn't got it right in being in time, because there's a more basic function of language, which is really later, he's going to say, the poetic function, where language can name new distinctions and make people notice them and share them and bring them, so to speak, into the clearing, into disclosive space.

334
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,200
And he thinks that's the main function of language.

335
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:10,681
It's language when it's already dead, when it's just got normal words like nails and doors referring to nails and doors.

336
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:27,721
It's when something new, my example, it is a bit dated now, but when I was teaching here in the 70s, the people in Marin were known for having their hot tubs and their marijuana and their certain Marin lifestyle.

337
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:35,720
I remember once the visitors from Marin calling up the person at their house to start warming up their hot tub because they were on the way home and so forth.

338
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:40,361
But I mean, what I want to say about that is somebody called that laid-bent.

339
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:45,321
And that became, obviously, a way of talking about that lifestyle.

340
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:53,241
And that helped, presumably, the people in Marin understand what they were doing and get more equipment for doing it.

341
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:57,080
And all of this is the poetic use of language.

342
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,841
There wasn't a node called laid back, which some poet just dumped a word on.

343
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,560
It shows up that way, thanks to having a new name for it.

344
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,961
Heidegger's thought, we go to the fountain through the word fountain.

345
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:14,520
I don't know what he has in mind with that.

346
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:36,401
My example, another example I made up besides the Marin one, is that instead of the fountain, if he said to me, we go through to the woods through the word woods, I'd sort of say, yeah, I see that, because we've got all these different words and we approach it differently as a wilderness, as a grove, as a copse, as a forest, as a woods.

347
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:47,520
They're just a bunch of trees, but depending on what discriminations poets writing about them have given, we will see them differently.

348
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,080
And they're not, again, just nodes on the referential hole in which words are bopped there.

349
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,601
They're meant to constantly poets are making new distinctions.

350
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,440
I saw another hand.

351
00:34:59,441 --> 00:34:59,920
No?

352
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:01,520
Okay, I think I'm done with that.

353
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:10,640
That's as far as that isn't even going to be next semester because he doesn't get any clearer about the way language functions until way later.

354
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,161
And in the later Heidegger, he writes a lot about language and a lot about poetry.

355
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:20,800
There's some place in here he writes a sentence about poetry, which is sort of pathetic.

356
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:22,000
I don't think I can open to it.

357
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,040
Maybe you can remember.

358
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,201
I think it's in the Disposiness chapter where he tells you that poets write about their feelings.

359
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,880
And that's just not very Heideggerian, and it's a pretty simple-minded view of poetry.

360
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:42,401
That goes with his not understanding this other thing about language, which he knows he's missing, but doesn't know what it is.

361
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:45,040
Okay, that's time to finish language.

362
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,880
I was supposed to finish it about a week ago.

363
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:49,201
We're going on to fallenness.

364
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,801
And falling is no, I don't want to do falling yet.

365
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,801
That's wait a minute.

366
00:35:56,801 --> 00:35:58,801
I don't think I do, just a second.

367
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,281
No, falling for, I may get there yet, but I prefer, we've got to do things in the order they are here.

368
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:09,400
And the order back to way of where we are, where are we?

369
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:19,561
On to yeah, here we are, 210.

370
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:29,801
The next thing after the talk about language and discourse and logos and all that we've been doing is to talk about a whole section on falling.

371
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:36,680
And I'm going to start with it next time because this little introductory piece doesn't mean anything by itself on 210.

372
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,800
But falling is a big, but I will tell you this much.

373
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:42,520
How many have been reading the falling part already?

374
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,321
It's hard because, and I'll get, but I said this once, but I have to keep saying it.

375
00:36:47,321 --> 00:37:01,561
I think falling has at least these two different meanings, which is mean being absorbed in the world and in coping, and then something bad that you do with it, where you cover up what's going on.

376
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,160
And I'll talk about that next time.

377
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:16,200
But before we get there, we've got these sort of existentialist kind of outbursts where he talks about idle talk, and he talks about curiosity, he talks about ambiguity.

378
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,520
That's when I want to talk about them now.

379
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:31,961
Those sections would be interesting for paper topics only because they've got in them the same kind of confusion that you get in that's part of the one.

380
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:48,520
There's something positive about the way discourse works, which is not idle talk, but is, which means the German is in Javeda means gossip or chatter.

381
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:56,801
And the latest word for it, I don't know if you follow this big success of the book by a professor at Princeton named Harry Frankfurt on bullshit.

382
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,321
Do you know that you must have heard about it?

383
00:37:58,321 --> 00:37:59,601
It was a big hit.

384
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,200
It's strange that to me, the philosophy book.

385
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:10,961
Well, I think that what Harry Frankfurt calls bullshit is exactly what Heidegger calls idle talk.

386
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:22,721
For instance, he says a kind of thing that Harry Frankfurt says, that the person engaged in this isn't trying to lie or deceive you, he says on 213.

387
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:27,840
It's that bullshit is not false statements.

388
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:40,480
It's some way of talking that isn't functioning to disclose anything.

389
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,921
It's functioning more to cover up everything.

390
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,921
I think it'd be an interesting paper topic.

391
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:52,961
But if your TA, if you're interested and your TA doesn't like it, I'll consider it.

392
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:58,401
I would like to compare Harry Frankfurt on bullshit to Heidegger on idle talk.

393
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:00,000
I think it would be very illuminating.

394
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,480
I don't know.

395
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,681
Do you think they're the same?

396
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,120
I think they're probably the same.

397
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:11,280
But you'd learn a lot because Frankfurt's very interesting and smart and a real phenomenologist, though he is considered an analytic philosopher.

398
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:15,520
He's going to describe the phenomena, and Heidegger's going to do it here.

399
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,360
And one more reference, because it's a whole interesting subject.

400
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,640
Harry Frankfurt's probably never read Kierkegaard, but Kierkegaard's got a category in his.

401
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:37,881
Kierkegaard wrote something called The Present Age, in which he talked about all the things that's wrong with contemporary 1850 Denmark, which is still wrong with us.

402
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:41,160
And he has a category he calls talkativeness.

403
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,080
I don't know what the Danish is.

404
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,201
And I think Heidegger gets this thing about idle talk from Kierkegaard on talkativeness.

405
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,361
But then you get a new problem.

406
00:39:52,361 --> 00:40:00,440
That is, Kierkegaard's clear that he's talking about some negative bad thing that people do.

407
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:06,280
The trouble is that Heidegger's got two things mixed up in here, just like he does in the one.

408
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:12,600
There's a sense in which, well, let me back up and make it because I jumped something.

409
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:20,761
What idle talk in Kierkegaard and in Heidegger?

410
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:22,440
No, that's not the way to do it.

411
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:33,161
Idle talk in Heidegger is how you use language to talk about what you don't know anything about, that you're just passing the word along.

412
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:48,121
And you pretend to sort of know all sorts of stuff, and you talk about it as if you knew, and you maybe even fool yourself into thinking you know what you're talking about, that you really are out, you aren't relating to the phenomena.

413
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:51,720
And that's negative, for sure.

414
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:55,561
And that's, I think, what Kierkegaard means by talkativeness.

415
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,201
And I don't know whether it's what Frankfurt means by bullshit, but one should find out.

416
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:18,201
But there is also a sense in which it's an important positive aspect of intelligibility, that we use language outside the situations in which we definitely know what we're talking about and can actually see it and point it out.

417
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:26,160
And so that blessing the word along is not always a negative sort of phenomenon.

418
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:33,281
If we couldn't talk about anything except what we were sort of nose-to-nose with in the situation, we'd be in bad shape.

419
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:37,600
And I think he's got these two notions mixed up together.

420
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:52,160
So that idle talk derived seems to cover gossip and chatter, and it also seems to cover saying whatever you say when you haven't got the sort of full right to say it.

421
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,680
It's either something you haven't studied or it's something that you haven't done.

422
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:10,000
I think I've used the example, but I'll use it again, of if you take your car in to be fixed because it's making a sputtering kind of noise, and your car mechanic says, ah, yes, when you pick it up, the carburetor was dirty.

423
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,921
And you go home and your partner asks you, well, what was wrong with the car, and you say the carburetor was dirty.

424
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:22,480
Well, that's idle talk because you have no clue what carburetors are, I'm assuming.

425
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,441
And you're just passing the word along.

426
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:26,961
But that's a necessary thing.

427
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,761
What if you would just refuse to answer the question?

428
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:32,320
Because you don't have any first-hand knowledge.

429
00:42:32,321 --> 00:42:33,361
That would be silly.

430
00:42:33,361 --> 00:42:34,721
I mean, it tells something.

431
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,680
And a lot of what we know or what we talk about, we don't fully understand.

432
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,640
Philosophers are sort of annoying in that respect.

433
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:55,601
At least I annoy my wife, and I notice, I mean, I know that other people's husbands or wives that aren't philosophers get upset if you keep asking people, sort of, and how do you know that?

434
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,560
And did you hear that?

435
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,840
And did you hear that on the radio?

436
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:00,080
But how do you know you should believe the guy on the radio?

437
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Or where did you read it?

438
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,320
Or more questions about it.

439
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:21,881
I think it's a perfectly sensible thing to want to find out as much, find out whether the person telling you something, how much the person that's telling you something is really understands of what they're telling you, but you've got to put up with it.

440
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:22,841
Yeah.

441
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,200
Okay, I marked it.

442
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:29,320
I'll go back to my notes.

443
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,680
Let's go back to my notes.

444
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,480
Let's see.

445
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,720
Well, to begin with, but this is not it yet.

446
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:39,080
I'm just taking a slight detour.

447
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:47,560
It's important that the top of 2.11, right before he introduces idle talk, he wants to say that he's talking purely ontologically.

448
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:52,280
He's not making a moralizing critique of everyday Dasein and so forth.

449
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:58,360
Now, that's already an interesting sort of clue because I think that's ambivalent too.

450
00:43:58,361 --> 00:44:06,040
I think sometimes he is really describing some structure, and it's not anything that you should blame anybody for.

451
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,000
Maybe the carburetor, my example, is like that.

452
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,160
But it also, but there is sometimes it looks to me like he is saying sort of that this is a bad way to use language and a bad way to be.

453
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,080
So the problem is still around.

454
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,240
I haven't answered your question.

455
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,801
So let's go on.

456
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:32,360
So on 2.11, again, I don't think this is going to settle it, but he says that it's a positive phenomenon.

457
00:44:32,361 --> 00:44:34,201
We have to understand what that means.

458
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,161
The expression idle talk is not used here in a disparaging signification.

459
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:46,681
Terminologically, it signifies a positive phenomenon which constitutes the kind of being of everyday Dasein's understanding and interpreting.

460
00:44:47,961 --> 00:45:03,921
That makes it look like it's covers a lot of what everybody has to do all the time, namely talk about stuff that they don't really deeply, primordially understand.

461
00:45:04,241 --> 00:45:04,881
Let me go on.

462
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:07,040
Even then, I haven't answered Curtis.

463
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:08,401
Understand that.

464
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:10,881
So I have other quotes which make it look.

465
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:28,321
Remember, I'm trying to argue that Heidegger sees that passing the word along, talking about what you don't really know much about, is something that is necessary if we're going to get around in the world.

466
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:34,480
Let's skip down to about 10 lines below where it says 168 in the margin on 211.

467
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,921
The understanding, which has been, let's say, where are we now?

468
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:39,520
Primordium.

469
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:42,480
Let's begin in the middle, right above the 168.

470
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:54,561
Proximately and within certain limits, Dasein is constantly delivered over to this interpretiveness, which controls and distributes the possibilities of average understanding and of the average disposedness.

471
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:08,401
The way things have been expressed or spoken out is such that in the totality of the context of significance into which it's been articulated, it preserves an understanding of the disposed world and therewith equiprimordial understanding of Dasein being with and so forth.

472
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:11,201
Now, that doesn't sound bad.

473
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:28,801
The understanding which has thus already been deposited in the way things have been expressed pertains just as much to any traditional discoveredness of entities which may have been reached as it does to one's current understanding of being, and to whatever possibilities and horizons for fresh interpretation and conceptual articulation may be available.

474
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:32,320
Now, all that looks like a perfectly sensible, yeah, what do you think?

475
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:40,441
I mean, it doesn't sound yet like a negative covering up.

476
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:45,561
Yes, and that's, and it sounds like he's just sort of laying out the positive side there.

477
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,800
And he's at the very bottom of the page.

478
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:52,601
He says that it leads to, it makes communication possible.

479
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:59,640
And I think that doesn't sound like he's saying that there's anything wrong with it.

480
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,201
I mean, it's necessary for everyday communication and intelligibility.

481
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:11,081
Okay, that's a good way to put it.

482
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:21,240
Now, but there is, but let's, I want to go on a little bit more there because I'm trying to sort out as I talk about these three: the positive and the negative.

483
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:24,520
They all have, remember, keep them in remembering the one.

484
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:43,000
The one, the norms, are necessary for conforming and for intelligibility, but they also lead to being conformist and covering up by just always looking at what one sees and what one does.

485
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,441
It can be a bad influence.

486
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:49,321
So I think you're going to get the same thing always.

487
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:54,921
And that's obviously some important structural fact going on here.

488
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,480
And this is average intelligibility, Geveda.

489
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:08,520
I mean, you see already, don't you feel a kind of tension between gossip and bullshit on the one hand and average everyday intelligibility on the other?

490
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,600
I mean, do they sound like the same thing?

491
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,721
I don't think so.

492
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:26,720
And yet, Heidegger just weaving them together in a way that gets you the Kierkegaardian sort of denunciation of them, but preserves also a kind of Heideggerian sense of everydayness.

493
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:28,961
Okay, two hands here and then here.

494
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:29,601
Yeah.

495
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,120
We haven't really talked about it yet.

496
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,080
Go ahead.

497
00:48:45,361 --> 00:48:49,280
The point isn't to like uncover a deep truth or being something.

498
00:48:49,281 --> 00:48:55,201
It's like wanting to talk to someone as like a social thing, like enjoy the conversation.

499
00:48:55,921 --> 00:49:00,401
That it's not like that it's covering up in some sense.

500
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:03,201
It seems like not much of a criticism.

501
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,321
Okay, well, good, good.

502
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:11,600
I think, I mean, I think the word gossip is important here and bullshit.

503
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:32,561
There's something that he doesn't, that he's trying to get at on the negative side, which is covering up, not just not going deep into things, but actually sort of talking about, I think, what you have no understanding of and no business talking about and no involvement and no interest.

504
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,520
I mean, it's not like having a conversation with a friend.

505
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,281
Gossip isn't, I don't think.

506
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:42,161
And it certainly isn't like having a conversation with the grocer when you're buying the groceries.

507
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:58,081
There's something really pejorative about that very, the notion of people just you get the feeling of people talking without trying to communicate anything.

508
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:00,401
That's the negative kind.

509
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:02,560
I'll find your passages that sound like that.

510
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,361
But I agree with you.

511
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:09,720
I mean, I'm agreeing with you that lots of the time talking is not gossiping.

512
00:50:09,721 --> 00:50:11,000
It's not Gereda.

513
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:11,961
It's Reda.

514
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,841
It's talk.

515
00:50:12,921 --> 00:50:13,480
You get it.

516
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,401
The German, there are two just German words.

517
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:22,761
There's this German word talk, which is what you do with your friends when you have conversations and what you do with the grocer and the car mechanic.

518
00:50:22,761 --> 00:50:29,000
And then there's this special word grede, which is this bad thing, which he keeps telling you how bad it is.

519
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,401
I haven't read those passages yet, but I will.

520
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:34,921
He keeps telling you, of course, I'm not making any moral judgment.

521
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:36,200
I'm not really saying it's bad.

522
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:39,000
The whole thing is really makes me dizzy.

523
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,801
Yeah.

524
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,921
You have to understand how the doctor was positive and negative.

525
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:52,441
I didn't understand how it is that the doctor gets this checker.

526
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:55,961
And I think what I'm pointing to is the authentic being offensive speaker.

527
00:50:55,961 --> 00:50:59,080
So with respect to idle talk, I wanted to give two examples.

528
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,720
And there's an example called idle talk.

529
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,961
But we said like chatting the rave on.

530
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:15,480
I remember like canceled Poland one time like language is long-range perception, right?

531
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:21,000
And in that sense, like when I tell you like when I was like changing the room and I'm like, yeah, it's raining outside.

532
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,441
That was like an idle thought.

533
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:24,280
But it wasn't anything.

534
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:34,441
Like the way I understood raining and outside, all of the experience I gave you with my idle talks was chatting with along about the world was entirely from the doctor's mind.

535
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,441
I was like, that phrase, the government, the doctor's mind.

536
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:46,560
So, wait, I agree with Doctor's point is that it's a negative aspect of the non-flunded.

537
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:52,560
If that it inexplicable aspects, it's publicly interpreted a lot of the world always for you.

538
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:56,640
And so then, and so and we accept it, yeah, like the world, we covered up a lot.

539
00:51:56,881 --> 00:51:58,480
We have a lot of things.

540
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,081
Well, wait, but I suppose, but I'm not happy with this.

541
00:52:02,801 --> 00:52:04,800
But you helped me understand something, I think.

542
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:07,280
So let me try to take over what you said.

543
00:52:09,281 --> 00:52:11,281
Well, let me take the half first.

544
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:16,081
I mean, I think, I mean, if you take the example, you come in and you say, it's raining.

545
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,441
I mean, I think I can sort of make a distinction.

546
00:52:19,441 --> 00:52:27,280
If you say that to people who are actually here and involved and have to go out in it when I finish my lecture and so forth, that's not idle talk.

547
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:29,121
That's communicating something.

548
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:34,961
If you come in and you say, it's raining like cats and dogs in New York, I just heard it on the news.

549
00:52:34,961 --> 00:52:36,240
That's talkativeness.

550
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:36,961
Who cares?

551
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:50,321
It's just not our concern that there are people going around all the time telling you all the things they just read in the morning New York Times or something, even though it doesn't have anything to do with what your life is and what serious.

552
00:52:50,321 --> 00:52:52,000
That's idle talk, I think.

553
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:02,721
That's just talk for the sake of, I mean, maybe there's a sort of social use for it, but it certainly isn't there because it directly connects with your concerns.

554
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,840
I mean, you help me.

555
00:53:03,841 --> 00:53:19,201
Maybe that's the essence of the gossip story and the bullshit story, that you're being told things, not that are false or are true, but are things that it's none of your business to know and you shouldn't be caring about.

556
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:27,281
I mean, gossips go around talking about other people's private relationships and so forth, and they're none of your business.

557
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,080
If that's true, then it isn't going to be quite like bullshit.

558
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,840
There's a whole interesting world here.

559
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,761
But take your second plan.

560
00:53:45,881 --> 00:53:52,520
I always want to go like whenever I talk about whether it's a negative, it's positive phenomena, at least in this case, but where is it coming from?

561
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,321
Where did it fall?

562
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:57,240
And like, a lot of times the bond does not come on, right?

563
00:53:57,961 --> 00:54:11,720
So, like, what so what's another what's like the top example is they've like Martin Luther when he like uh started waiting like what it was to be biased with doing like your checks rather than wanting the church to be like free of cause and revolution.

564
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:13,561
That was like talk.

565
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,681
Uh that was why it was positive.

566
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:30,441
Uh I want to say it wasn't because like he was like what he was doing with his work there was his talk is like an unbounded sort of like yeah well that's okay yeah that's too that's too positive.

567
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:39,401
I mean surely nobody doubts yeah nobody doubts that poetic prophetic revolutionary kind of talk is positive.

568
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,160
The question is this middle kind of thing.

569
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,000
That's why your first example is interesting.

570
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:46,681
What kind of thing is coming in and saying it's raining?

571
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:55,000
And that's not like Martin Luther for sure, but that's not like it's raining in New York or even more raining in China.

572
00:54:57,241 --> 00:55:10,480
It's not, yeah, we're not trying to understand what we did, but the question is, where did our sense of what Martin Luther did from his positivity, but some of the steel that will be like, and why is that positivity?

573
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,560
Well, I don't know.

574
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:20,961
I mean, wait, wait, but I think everything you say makes me think of things that you're not quite saying, but maybe you're getting there.

575
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:42,080
I mean, if you repeat what Martin Luther said, just sort of because you happen to have heard or read that Martin Luther said that, and that it makes no difference in your life or the life of the person you're talking to, or it doesn't reveal anything about Protestantism or anything, it's just a report, then I think that's idle talk.

576
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,841
That's just talkativeness.

577
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:58,081
But if you say the same things that Martin, the same thing Martin Luther said about works and faith and so forth in such a way that it impinges on the people's lives and illuminates them, that's positive, all right.

578
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,240
But now, there's so many people want to talk.

579
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:02,240
You were next, and then David was next.

580
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:14,241
Well, I guess I give a clear example of talking about the Greek culture and Aristotle's claim that your objects fall faster.

581
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:17,921
Then everybody now is starting to talk about this idea that many things fall faster.

582
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:19,200
They have no business talking about it.

583
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:21,200
They don't bother and study this report.

584
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,841
But everybody's Greek study understood that heavy objects fall faster.

585
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:32,801
And this is a clear example of negative and positive aspect because, well, the negative aspect, it was a lot.

586
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:42,881
If I look into it, positive aspect is that this Greek culture, I mean, maybe it was communicating one of the aspects of the culture.

587
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:47,921
I mean, it's I'm not, I just can't, I'm not kidding.

588
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,040
I mean, I don't know what to say.

589
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,441
It's not just not the right kind of example, I think.

590
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:55,841
Yes, well, that's right.

591
00:56:55,841 --> 00:57:00,241
But that's what, that's right, but we that's not really covering up the way you said it.

592
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:00,801
Okay.

593
00:57:00,801 --> 00:57:07,880
But right, but but you do make me think about something, which is second, though, which I lose when I try to think of it.

594
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:19,081
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I don't think that the main point is whether what you say is false or not.

595
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:33,000
If somebody came in and said Flevian light objects fall at the same speed and even gave you the formula that Newton's got for it, it would be just plain talkativeness if it came in out of nowhere.

596
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,360
This is a Kierkegaard example.

597
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:50,520
Kierkegaard has this character who's insane but escapes from the insane asylum and goes around and tells everybody the earth is round, that nobody's asking, and it doesn't fit into the conversation, but it's an objective truth.

598
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,880
And so it's not a question of whether what you say is true or not.

599
00:57:53,881 --> 00:57:56,600
It's whether what you say is relevant or not.

600
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,041
I'm getting more and more convinced that that's the way to go.

601
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:02,841
But yeah, go ahead.

602
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:17,480
I mean, this is too much talking about ideas and theories and not enough about the real world.

603
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,200
I agree.

604
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,520
I mean, people don't gossip about whether objects fall at the same speed or not.

605
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,081
That's part of what she's saying.

606
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,200
Yeah, Dave.

607
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:34,360
During the impeachment, when Clinton was impeached, like suddenly everybody became an expert in constitutional law.

608
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,640
Yeah, yeah, and the talk shows.

609
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,280
The talk shows are good places for careda.

610
00:58:46,281 --> 00:58:48,041
Everybody's got an opinion.

611
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:56,080
It isn't an opinion that is not relevant to anything they know or anything they care that should be, you know, that concerns them and so forth.

612
00:58:56,401 --> 00:59:00,081
And that's what he's, I think, that's what he calls uprooted.

613
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:07,040
Whatever it is, we're trying to understand what it is to pass the word along and where your conversation has become uprooted.

614
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,040
Let me, before anybody says no, no, no more for a minute, we need some quotes.

615
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:18,961
We're drifting off into making up Heidegger instead of reading Heidegger, which is good fun, but we've got to go back to reading it.

616
00:59:20,241 --> 00:59:21,601
So let's see now.

617
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,601
I'm on 212 still, looking at crucial quotes.

618
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:35,441
So we're talking about understanding things only superficially and so forth.

619
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:39,680
I don't think I didn't read that first paragraph yet, did I on 212?

620
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,480
Let's read it.

621
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,041
In a language which is spoken when one expresses oneself, there lies an average intelligibility.

622
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,921
Now, this is our problem into what to do with that.

623
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,680
We're going to try to understand.

624
00:59:49,680 --> 01:00:01,441
And in accordance with this intelligibility, the discourse which is communicated can be understood to a considerable extent, even if the hearer doesn't bring himself into such a kind of being towards what the discourse is about as to have a primordial understanding of it.

625
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,520
To have a primordial understanding of it, you've got to really be there in the presence of the phenomenon.

626
01:00:07,841 --> 01:00:11,360
We do not so much understand the entities that are talked about.

627
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:14,080
We already are listening only to what is said in the talk as such.

628
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:19,520
What is said in the talk gets understood, but what the talk is about is understood only proximally and superficially.

629
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,480
That's the carburetor example, perfectly.

630
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:28,800
Now, that's one kind of Gareda, but not, that's not gossip.

631
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:34,681
That's just you have to talk about stuff that you don't have direct knowledge of.

632
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:40,601
He says we have the same thing in view because it is in the same averageness, so we have a common understanding.

633
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:41,640
And that's fine.

634
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:51,800
And now, I'm looking at my quotes, and now comes passing the word along and gossiping.

635
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:54,121
So let's go down a little further.

636
01:00:56,281 --> 01:01:03,081
And skipping to the middle of the page, middle of the paragraph, middle of everything, a sentence.

637
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:15,800
And because this discoursing has lost its primary relationship of being toward the entity talked about, or else never achieved such a relationship, it does not communicate in such a way as to let the entity be appropriated in a primordial manner.

638
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:20,841
It communicates rather by following the route of gossiping and passing the word along.

639
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:27,320
And then it goes in wider circles, and people understand it less and less, and there's no grounds anymore.

640
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:31,961
People are just repeating it till it gets aggravated to complete groundlessness.

641
01:01:31,961 --> 01:01:33,641
And that's certainly negative.

642
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:38,840
And indeed, the idle talk is not confined to vocal gossip that spreads.

643
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:46,681
Okay, there's scribbling, which is now maybe blogging, where people are passing their opinions around.

644
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,721
He doesn't have to be talking to people.

645
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:56,200
And then it's not based so much on hearsay as superficial reading.

646
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,841
He says, I'm just trying to read stuff that will give us a clue.

647
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:05,881
The average understanding will never be able to decide what has been drawn from primal sources with a struggle and how much is just gossip.

648
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:10,281
That is, you know, just words, talk, but nothing behind it.

649
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:14,041
The average understanding will not want any such distinction.

650
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,920
It does not need it because, of course, it understands everything.

651
01:02:16,921 --> 01:02:19,640
Well, that's now that's okay for a while.

652
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:42,720
Let me because we've so and now there's all this negative talk then on 213, and that's more of what I guess I just have to read this because we've gotten so deep into trying to understand what's negative about it.

653
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:48,480
The top of 213, the groundlessness of idle talk is no obstacle that it's becoming public.

654
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,761
Idle talk is the possibility of understanding everything without previously making the thing one's own.

655
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:54,880
It's funny.

656
01:02:54,881 --> 01:03:06,801
More and more as I read it, I think it fits the carburetor's case, but it doesn't fit the case that I think is really interesting, which is the relevance test, whether what you're talking about is anything you or who you're talking to should care about.

657
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:08,480
So see if that ever comes up.

658
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,801
If this were done, idle talk would found her and so forth.

659
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:15,361
Idle talk, I mean idle talk is something which anyone can rake up.

660
01:03:15,361 --> 01:03:23,681
It not only releases one from the task of genuine understanding, but develops an undifferentiated kind of intelligibility for which nothing is closed off.

661
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:31,040
Well, yeah, that doesn't strike me as particularly it's negative.

662
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,160
I mean, it certainly isn't giving any positive contribution, but it doesn't seem to be right on for negative.

663
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,280
So let's try once more.

664
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:45,921
Discourse, which belongs to the essential state of Dasein's being, it has a share in constituting Dasein's disclosures, has the possibility of becoming idle talk.

665
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:54,480
And when it does, it serves not so much to keep being in the world open for us in an articulated understanding as to close it off and cover up the entities within the world.

666
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,520
To do this need not, one need not aim to deceive.

667
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,801
It's not lying.

668
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,240
That's not the point.

669
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:04,961
Idle talk does not have the kind of being which belongs to consciously passing off something.

670
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:14,201
The fact that something has been said groundlessly and gets passed along in further retelling amounts to perverting the act of disclosing into an act of closing off.

671
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:19,401
For what is said is always understood approximately as saying something, that is, and uncovering something.

672
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:27,641
So by very nature, idle talk closes off, since to go back to the ground to what is talked about is something which it leaves undone.

673
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:29,640
Well, what do you think?

674
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,120
I mean, okay, go ahead.

675
01:04:33,881 --> 01:04:39,080
Aristotle example you gave a really great reply, I think, but what I think.

676
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:48,120
I think you would have been saying that negative aspect of the way of dealing with saying heavy objects fall faster.

677
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:57,480
Maybe like that's like, I mean, why do you want to privilege your special way of fall faster?

678
01:04:57,881 --> 01:04:59,801
But this is, yeah, but so it's wrong.

679
01:04:59,961 --> 01:05:02,280
And it's being wrong is not what's important.

680
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:09,640
Like Aristotle's present, heavy objects fall faster because it's a good description of their world.

681
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:18,760
I think the negativity in that doesn't why is that that like they have a tendency to like cover up worlds?

682
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:24,760
That's a big cover up world comes from when we go in for something like concept and one from the day.

683
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:43,400
The negativity that expressed here is something like what Aristotle's good description is when the Greeks started repeating and understanding their world with afraid heavy objects falling faster, they were no longer enough enough.

684
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,761
I've heard enough about heavy objects.

685
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,841
Whoever back there said we're not talking about scientific stuff was right.

686
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:49,400
We're not.

687
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,881
And it's neither of is a if it's a bad example, it's a bad example.

688
01:05:52,881 --> 01:05:54,480
Now, I don't want to hear about it anymore.

689
01:05:54,481 --> 01:05:55,760
Oh, go ahead.

690
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,921
There isn't a relation between Dasman and Eideltoff.

691
01:06:13,921 --> 01:06:15,680
Yes, is that what you're saying?

692
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,320
Well, I'll tell you something.

693
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,080
Well, there isn't much of a relation.

694
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:20,881
I'll try to explain.

695
01:06:20,961 --> 01:06:43,200
As best I can see, they're similar, but not in an interesting way, really, because what's clear about Dasman is you can make a distinction between conforming, which everybody has to do in their pronunciation and everything, and being a conformist, let me doing what you do for the sake of the one, for looking good, for doing what's respectable, and so forth.

696
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,040
That's a nice, clear distinction.

697
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:56,881
I wish I could get the same grip here, because you can say clearly about Dasman that if people didn't conform, there wouldn't be any intelligibility, and conforming is a completely positive thing.

698
01:06:56,881 --> 01:07:12,801
And you can say, on the other hand, if everybody only did what one did, there'd never be anything interesting or original, or people taking responsibility, or doing what's appropriate in their unique situation, and that would be bad news.

699
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:31,200
And so you can clearly say conformism is conformity, that is, doing things the way following the norms of the culture is good, and running your life by asking what are the norms and just doing them in your way of dealing with yourself and people and so forth.

700
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,400
That's just bad.

701
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:38,200
Now, I'm looking for something parallel to that, and you're right to want it, but I haven't seen it yet.

702
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:45,961
I mean, I want to find a way in which idle talk is something that's really necessary and important, and we couldn't have intelligibility without it.

703
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,360
Roughly, I think that's supposed to be.

704
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:52,120
We have to talk about things that we haven't got a primordial understanding of.

705
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,560
We've never actually seen them.

706
01:07:53,561 --> 01:08:01,160
We can't, and we have just been told secondhand about them from the newspapers and the radio and talk shows and so forth.

707
01:08:03,481 --> 01:08:04,681
No, I went too far.

708
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:06,120
Talk shows are not part of it.

709
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:06,841
They're bad.

710
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:16,440
So, no, but you've got to talk about things that you haven't got first-hand experience of because you just, there's a lot in the world that you haven't, and that's important for intelligibility.

711
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:20,760
It goes beyond the concrete context that you are in.

712
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:24,760
But then comes, and I don't know another word for it, what's the bad thing?

713
01:08:24,761 --> 01:08:28,680
Well, the bad thing isn't very clear to me yet.

714
01:08:28,681 --> 01:08:35,560
It seems to be talking about, oh, sorry, I really think there are three, but I was going to sum that up, but I better start.

715
01:08:35,561 --> 01:08:42,921
I mean, I think there's a neutral thing, which is talking about stuff that you don't have a first-hand experience of, but we need to talk about.

716
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:45,160
Like, well, what was wrong with the car?

717
01:08:45,641 --> 01:08:58,120
And there's a lot that we talk about that we don't have a primordial understanding of, but our conversation and our ability to organize and to coordinate our activities would break down without it.

718
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,801
Maybe that's the crucial thing.

719
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:02,200
That's the neutral kind of talk.

720
01:09:02,521 --> 01:09:04,200
I don't want to call it idle talk.

721
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:14,921
And then there is really idle talk, which I think isn't just talking about what you don't really know about primordially, because you've got to do wrong.

722
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:19,560
It's talking about what you don't know about primordially and is none of your business.

723
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:35,600
Then you really gotta a negative sort of thing that has no use in the way people live and coordinate their activity and just gives them the opportunity to pretend to know things and to just to gossip, period.

724
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:41,921
So I think there's a, I think we're getting there to a positive, neutral, and negative story.

725
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah, Melissa.

726
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:48,000
Wait, talk loud if you can.

727
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:59,440
You don't care whether there is anyone who's going to get too fast enough on you.

728
01:09:59,521 --> 01:10:01,761
I'll talk into the explanation you can give you.

729
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,881
Okay.

730
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,120
Okay.

731
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,000
Okay.

732
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:06,961
I guess that's.

733
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:09,200
I'll repeat it because you couldn't hear it.

734
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:20,640
Frankfurt says that when you're bullshitting, you're trying to say things that impress some other, some person with how much you know or how much understanding you have of something in which you don't really have any understanding of at all.

735
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:25,520
And you're not really even trying to convey that understanding.

736
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,400
And it doesn't matter to you whether it's true or false.

737
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:36,640
You're just trying to, if it's just trying to impress people, then it's not a much, then it's not like Heidegger's view, I think.

738
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:41,120
I think you could add to Frankfurt, you just want to keep the conversation going.

739
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:42,961
Or is that not bullshit yet?

740
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:44,560
That's just friendliness or something.

741
01:10:44,561 --> 01:10:45,520
Talkativeness.

742
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,040
Yeah.

743
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:50,881
Yeah.

744
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:08,360
It's it's a it's a it's I think you have to add that to what the negative list.

745
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:22,360
I mean, I want to what I don't understand yet, and I don't want to spend, well, I can't spend much more time on it, uh, but what I would like to have, and you can come and think about it maybe and come and talk to me in office hours, is some I can think of the positive side as pretty clear.

746
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:30,760
You've got to talk about stuff that you don't have a primordial understanding of to coordinate your activity and make a shared intelligibility.

747
01:11:30,761 --> 01:11:37,400
Uh and I can think of uh is that the neutral one or the positive one?

748
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,280
That's the positive one.

749
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,720
What was the neutral?

750
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,560
Have I come squished the two together?

751
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:48,520
I guess maybe the positive one is what I got it.

752
01:11:48,521 --> 01:11:50,120
I just squished the two together.

753
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:57,640
Positive would be when you talk about the situation that you were in and you had a primordial understanding and you were pointing it out.

754
01:11:57,641 --> 01:11:59,640
That would be just plain radar.

755
01:11:59,641 --> 01:12:09,961
Then there would be this kind of neutral talk where if we're coordinating things and conveying some information, you talk about stuff you don't really know much about.

756
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:13,400
And then comes the one I haven't got a clear grip in.

757
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,400
This idle talk.

758
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,600
Is it gossip?

759
01:12:16,841 --> 01:12:19,720
That means talking about what's none of your business.

760
01:12:19,721 --> 01:12:32,120
Or is it bullshit, meaning showing off by making all kinds of complicated, snowing people with complicated talk which you don't really have any understanding of and you don't care and it isn't a question of true or false but just looking good.

761
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,440
That could be another kind of it.

762
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:47,881
And another kind is when you are talking about no, maybe that's enough for the negative kind.

763
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:50,080
Wait, well, there's somebody before you.

764
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,040
Yes, you, yeah.

765
01:12:51,681 --> 01:12:52,320
Yeah.

766
01:12:49,641 --> 01:12:56,240
I met the guy behind you with fun, you and then him.

767
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,080
Okay, go ahead.

768
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:58,961
Yeah?

769
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,680
Martin didn't have his thoughts.

770
01:13:03,841 --> 01:13:07,440
Generally, as Martin should.

771
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:11,200
Income strength isn't almost hidden as how orange looks.

772
01:13:12,801 --> 01:13:15,040
Well, that good.

773
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:23,280
That's why you have to keep, I mean, there's another thing of just making conversation.

774
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:33,520
And surely I don't, I can't believe, I'm not sure, but maybe Heidegger and Kierkegaard aren't against if you're, you know, sitting next to somebody at a dinner making conversation about things.

775
01:13:33,761 --> 01:13:35,120
But that's not gossip.

776
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,640
I mean, I think that it's okay.

777
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:51,520
I would call that the neutral thing, where you are talking, you're not covering stuff up, you're not showing off, you're not doing, you're talking about what's none of your business, and you're not pretending that you know something you don't know.

778
01:13:52,961 --> 01:14:01,760
The neutral thing is you're using language to be sociable, to get some shared activity done or some kind of coordinated activity.

779
01:14:01,761 --> 01:14:02,961
That sounds okay.

780
01:14:02,961 --> 01:14:04,801
But now I want to hear from you.

781
01:14:04,801 --> 01:14:05,200
Yeah.

782
01:14:09,681 --> 01:14:10,560
That's right.

783
01:14:10,561 --> 01:14:11,040
Okay.

784
01:14:13,921 --> 01:14:19,200
Oh, I mean, Don, you're orange one to talk.

785
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,320
Heidegger.

786
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:31,200
Do you know these things about this person and not only talk about followers, but you don't have a silence 'cause he says there can't be a meaningful silence unless you actually have something.

787
01:14:31,521 --> 01:14:32,080
That's right.

788
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:36,200
Maybe there's something I sort of sympathize here.

789
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:40,200
What you're saying now maybe is that that that they they don't like small talk.

790
01:14:40,521 --> 01:14:45,080
They don't like talk just for the sake of filling the the the the vacuum.

791
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:50,600
They'd rather you either keep silent or you talk about what's important to you and the other person.

792
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:52,360
I think that makes sense.

793
01:14:52,360 --> 01:15:05,640
One other thing though is she mentioned something that earlier time you announced in conversation is that communication in terms of thoughts only are important to engagement in the sentence.

794
01:15:05,641 --> 01:15:10,921
So not only might you be pricing friends, but it might be sending all kinds of examples.

795
01:15:10,921 --> 01:15:19,720
And idle talk can be just a way of communities of serving membership in communities that would be otherwise influenced.

796
01:15:19,801 --> 01:15:21,320
Do you have any five violence?

797
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:30,200
Do you speak something to your neighbor or do you want to yeah, I I see what you're saying.

798
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:36,360
I'm afraid I think that's sort of off the chart in the only in the sense that Heidegger just doesn't think about it.

799
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,400
I I don't think he would call that the RADA.

800
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:46,600
I think, I mean, because I don't think it's sort of that doesn't have the effect of covering anything up.

801
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:51,801
Or it's it's got a kind of community effect.

802
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:53,801
Boys, those are weird things.

803
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:55,560
I didn't think there was so much in this.

804
01:15:55,561 --> 01:15:59,720
Okay, I I couldn't you get the last word because time is up.

805
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:13,480
Understanding everything without previously making the things it's on.

806
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:22,480
Which seemed like he's kind of saying idle thought is what fates is public understanding everything without really authentic.

807
01:16:22,481 --> 01:16:24,801
Well, it sounds like it sounds like bluffing.

808
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:31,761
It sounds like close to bullshit, where you don't, where you use idle talk to be able to seem to understand everything, but not really.

809
01:16:53,761 --> 01:16:55,360
Okay, we have to stop.

810
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:00,721
I mean, that if you feel like telling me more, please come to office hours and tell me about it.

811
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:05,921
Because I think now that we've gotten this far, it would be nice to get some crisp conclusion out of it.
