00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,320
We have gotten to care, having sort of rushed through falling, because I don't really like it very much, and haven't said much about fleeing because I don't think there's anything really useful to say about fleeing.

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,640
I don't think Heidegger really should have talked about fleeing.

3
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:25,480
It sounds sort of as if I don't think that he's got evidence that everybody is fleeing their unsettledness.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,320
He certainly, but in any case, it's going to come back, the fleeing issue, when we get to anxiety, which is what people are fleeing.

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,039
And so I'm not going to talk about it now.

6
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:41,320
But therefore, we are going right on to the care part.

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,159
And that's where a lot of that we've been talking about all falls together and gets put into place.

8
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,320
And you will recognize that.

9
00:00:53,639 --> 00:01:00,279
So today we're going to talk about pages 235 to 252, presumably, just so you can keep track.

10
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:05,639
And we're catching up because there's not that much that needs to be said about care, it turns out.

11
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:09,720
So, but anyway, so I'm going to cover 235 to 252.

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,199
That means both care and the problem of other minds.

13
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:23,240
The next time on Thursday, be sure and read just a few pages, but they're very important pages, and it's very interesting and hard.

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,560
252 through 256.

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
And then it's very important.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,680
This is about reality of the universe and reality of the Blackboard, too.

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,919
That's part of why it's so complicated.

18
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:44,040
And as for the universe, you've got to read that part of Division II.

19
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:47,800
This is all, sort of, reality for Thursday.

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,399
And now for today, care and the external world.

21
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,440
So, yeah, I'm in the way of what I write on the board.

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,039
Why don't I put it up there?

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,160
Okay.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:34,240
So he summarizes on 224, where we're going to start, way back there, because that's the beginning of the section of which the whole chapter, of which the care part is one part, the skepticism with respect to the external world is another part, and the reality of whatever there is is a third part.

25
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:43,519
And I'm trying to give you an overall view, sir, because it's always hard to know what's going on in this book for the first few hundred readings.

26
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:55,199
So there's the care structure part sums up and pulls together all the being in, the world part that we've had.

27
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,320
Then, and that's really in a certain way the end of Division I.

28
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,920
You'll see when we read the details.

29
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,279
I mean, he's done it.

30
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:11,040
And then, but he has two things he wants to talk about, which are somehow not architectonically necessary, but very important and interesting.

31
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:19,120
He wants to talk about the epistemological implications of the story about care, which he's now told you.

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,720
That's the next part.

33
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,080
That's the other, the external world issue.

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:44,840
And he wants to talk about the ontological question, in the old sense of ontological question, and how what he's done affects the question of realism versus idealism, whether there's anything in the world that in the universe that doesn't depend on us or if everything depends on us, just how does it all depend on us and so forth.

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,519
That's for Thursday.

36
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,319
Then we'll be done.

37
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,280
No, then we have truth.

38
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:50,680
That's right.

39
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,120
That's the next week.

40
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,639
And then we go back and read the two introductions.

41
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,960
Okay, so we've got an overview of Dasein, he says, on 224.

42
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:07,480
And where?

43
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,480
224.

44
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
No, yeah, 224.

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,920
Well, I don't see it.

46
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,960
Well, let's read what I marked and see why I marked it.

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,439
The bottom paragraph, first sentence.

48
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,960
The leading question of this chapter has been about the being of the there.

49
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:28,679
Okay, our theme has been the ontological constitution of the disclosedness which essentially belongs to Dasein.

50
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:38,680
The being of that disclosedness is constituted by, look, there's one of the threes that I noted, by disposedness, understanding, and discourse.

51
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,399
That's fine.

52
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,480
That's just a summary of where we are.

53
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,600
And notice that discourse comes in there as if it was the third one.

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:55,399
And it's confusing because on page 400, it turns out discourse turns out to be sort of for all over all three.

55
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,639
And falling gets put there.

56
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,959
And you just have to, where's my chart?

57
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:08,280
So that's why I say that you, the threefold that's on 224 on the chart is also on 400.

58
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,160
And on 400, it's different.

59
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:26,639
So it's, and I guess I should put, I've got constantly revising this, after discourse, you might want to put parentheses falling, because discourse gets replaced by falling when discourse gets promoted to be all three.

60
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,519
So on 220, so we finished what we finished.

61
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:40,639
Now on 225, one, 225, at the bottom, he goes on to sort of summing up what he's got.

62
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:49,120
Dasein in italics, Dasein's average everydayness can be defined as being in the world which is falling and disclosed.

63
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,279
So there's that threefold.

64
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,000
Falling and disclosed.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
That's falling.

66
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,880
See how they get so confusing because he sometimes throws in things in the threefold that confuse me.

67
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,079
So I want to read it.

68
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,480
Being in the world which is falling, thrown, and projecting.

69
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,200
And all of that's got disclosedness.

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,639
So why put it there?

71
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:23,840
So being in the world which is falling, thrown, and projecting, and for which its own less possibilities for being is an issue, both in its being amidst the world and its being with others.

72
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
That's what we've been talking about.

73
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:33,840
That's the, and it's put all together there in sort of one of the threefolds.

74
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,440
And now what are we doing?

75
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,959
Have we done all that?

76
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
Well, yeah, we've done all that.

77
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,159
What else can he do about it?

78
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:52,000
Well, what he wants to do about it is show how those three all hang together in some systematic way so that you know that you've got them all when you've got the three.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,080
So that at the beginning of the next chapter, he says, being in the world is a structure which is primordially and constantly whole.

80
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,680
And he wants to go, and I'm going to read more, because this is the subject that he's now getting into.

81
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:15,480
He wants to say, in the preceding chapters, this structure has been elucidated phenomenally as a whole, and also in its constitutive items.

82
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:19,080
That's what the chart's got, all the constitutive items.

83
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:25,080
Though always on this basis, what basis?

84
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,040
Of the whole.

85
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:34,360
The preliminary glance which we gave to the whole of this phenomenon in the beginning has now lost the emptiness of its first general sketch of it.

86
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:43,479
Remember, the beginning is we can formally indicate the being that we're going to study the being whose being is an issue for it.

87
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:51,639
The essence of we're going to study us, namely the being whose essential characteristic is that its being is an issue for it.

88
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,200
That's what he's talking about in the beginning.

89
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,120
And that was by way of formal indication, it was empty and general.

90
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,840
And he go on.

91
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:14,520
To be sure, the constitution of the structural whole and its everyday kind of being is phenomenologically so manifold that it can easily obstruct our looking at the whole as such phenomenologically in a way that's unified.

92
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,800
That's interesting.

93
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,519
Remember way back, these are all kinds of reviews, partly that I'm doing, partly that he's doing.

94
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:33,639
Remember, I read you where Wittgenstein says that the background practices that in effect make up being in the world, though he doesn't have those terms, are so manifold, such a, I forget what the word is.

95
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,079
Remember the word?

96
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,399
The what?

97
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,720
Hurly-burley, right, right.

98
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,159
The Geovimmel in German.

99
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:47,480
It's such a hurly-burley that Wittgenstein thinks you can't find it, you can't say anything unified about it.

100
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,199
And I said, but Heidegger's going to show that it has a whole lot of structure, and that's what he's now saying.

101
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,720
Look, we showed that it's got a whole lot of structure, even though it looks so manifold.

102
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:18,240
And but we may look at it more freely, but we may look at it more freely, and our unified view of it may be held in readiness more securely if we now raise the question toward which we've been working in our preparatory fundamental analysis of Dasein in general: how is the totality of the structural whole, which we have pointed out, to be defined in an existential ontological manner?

103
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:27,200
And what's interesting is that there's really nothing new going on in this chapter, except it's a question of how it's going to be defined.

104
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:44,320
What he wants is a word for it, which he's going to define as expressing the unity of it, telling you the whole story and how the pieces hang together, all in how he's going to define that magic word, which is care.

105
00:09:44,639 --> 00:10:00,319
And one reason the chapter doesn't really contribute anything in a certain way, it doesn't tell you anything more about the phenomena, it just is a kind of way of telling you what he's already shown you when he talks about the phenomena.

106
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,480
So we have to read it that way.

107
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:11,440
And on, so now we have to jump, I say, let's see, 225, 226.

108
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,160
Okay.

109
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,559
You can't make up, he's a second paragraph.

110
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,440
You don't make up the structural whole by putting together elements.

111
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,160
He always thinks, you know, the structure is prior to the aspects and they're not elements.

112
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:41,639
The being of Dasein, upon which the structural whole is such, is ontologically supported, becomes accessible to us when we look at all the ways through this whole to a single primordial unitary phenomenon.

113
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,639
Okay, but he's not really telling you anything new there.

114
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,680
He's just saying that that's what he's going to do.

115
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:57,240
And then he goes on and he says, here's the human, here's, he begins to tell you the unified structure.

116
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,200
And why will he be telling you anything new?

117
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:14,760
Well, nothing except that these are the aspects of a being who's taking a stand on its being, and that's the thing that holds them all together, and they're aspects of that.

118
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:16,919
That's all he's done, I think.

119
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,480
Good.

120
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,200
You think there's more to say?

121
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,160
Well, he's an important element in a story you don't know.

122
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:47,000
Namely, the LA Times is going to run a story on podcasting, and this course is sort of singled out as a kind of paradigm case, I think, I haven't read it, of the virtues and vices of podcasting.

123
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,839
And you are the virtues, and the empty seats are the vices.

124
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,039
And he's taking pictures of them.

125
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:58,840
But I suppose I've got enough so that you could stop doing it?

126
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,920
Or he needs more.

127
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,359
Well, it's in the interest of the good of the university and of podcasting.

128
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,519
You just may have to put up with him for a while.

129
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,240
I'm sorry.

130
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,160
You had a hand up over here.

131
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,480
Yeah.

132
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, I mean, I it would be, I mean, if we were recording it instead of taking pictures of it, we could interview all and ask you why you're here and not where all the other people are.

133
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:33,039
And it's such an important question what to do.

134
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,119
I mean, I want to podcast the course.

135
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:38,720
There are people all over the world who claim that they're getting a whole lot out of the course.

136
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Some of them go back to the university or to college because of the course.

137
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:50,799
And on the other hand, I don't like talking to a room that's empty and I don't know what to do about it.

138
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,080
And maybe somehow this article will focus attention on it and somebody will think about what to do about it.

139
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,279
Yeah, Tyler.

140
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,319
Well, he's been doing that.

141
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:00,959
You haven't seen him.

142
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,439
He's been photographing it from back there.

143
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,319
Is it really?

144
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,439
How many think this is terribly distracting?

145
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:19,919
How many think you can manage to pay attention to me in spite of the fact that he's taking pictures of it?

146
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,879
I'm afraid, Tyler, you're just suffering from some attention deficit disorder.

147
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,559
And look, you see, new people are streaming in already.

148
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,799
Okay, this is enough of this.

149
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,679
We've got to go.

150
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,839
We're back to the issues.

151
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,240
And let him do his job.

152
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,240
Now, where are we?

153
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,480
On 236.

154
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,200
That's where he starts putting these pieces together.

155
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,480
And we just have to jump to 236 now because there is anxiety next.

156
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,039
You see, that was the preface to a whole section.

157
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,839
And we don't read a lot of that section right now.

158
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,200
We're not doing bleeding, and we're not doing anxiety, and we're not doing falling.

159
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,679
We're getting on to the next stage in this story that he's telling you how to put it all together.

160
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,880
And notice at the bottom of 235, he's got another one.

161
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,560
I think I've got it already, haven't I?

162
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:09,760
235.

163
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:19,240
Yes, where he gives you another one of the threefolds.

164
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:27,720
At the bottom, the fundamental ontological characteristics of this entity are existentiality, facticity, and being fallen.

165
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,119
Just a word about that.

166
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,319
That's a very funny threefold.

167
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:34,439
You see why?

168
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Because existence as a way of being is characteristic of Dasein in general.

169
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,000
I mean, a general characteristic of Dasein.

170
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,720
Existence is the name for the way of being of a being that takes a stand on its own being.

171
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:57,000
So maybe just, and if you put existence there, that's sort of like putting the whole story in as a piece of the story.

172
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:07,799
Maybe it helps if you call it existentiality and try to distinguish existentiality somehow from this general way of being of Dasein, that's existence.

173
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:18,920
Maybe you want to say that existence is taking a stand on your being by taking up something from the past and being immersed in the world.

174
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,279
It's the whole thing.

175
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:27,240
And existentiality is supposed to be somehow the future aspect of that whole thing.

176
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,160
But I don't know if that works.

177
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:38,439
I wish he had an extra word, but it's going to be defined as the being ahead of itself.

178
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,679
And that's the, because that's the future dimension.

179
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,639
By the way, I'm going to.

180
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,679
Let's see.

181
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,840
I go better stop here and just say this.

182
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,279
It should be obvious.

183
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:57,599
In fact, I made it obvious in my chart that it's no accident that we've got these three dimensions and that they're the whole story and that they're integrated.

184
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:04,720
What's sort of behind Heidegger's intuition that that's how it's got to be always a threefold?

185
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,960
I take it you understand that, but I'm never sure because there's so much throwing at you.

186
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,839
Do you understand why it's got these structures always come in threes?

187
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
Somebody must understand that.

188
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,159
Yeah, well, somebody, where I saw a hand.

189
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,440
It's not a big secret.

190
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,960
I mean, it's a it's yeah, that's right.

191
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,160
Temporality comes in three, past, present, and future.

192
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,480
Then it's what I put at the bottom of the chart.

193
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,760
And all of this, remember, finally, temporality is going to be behind everything and explain everything.

194
00:16:39,760 --> 00:17:01,359
And this is the beginning of it, where it turns out that Dasein's basic, primordial, fundamental, whatever you want, structure comes in a threefold, and not just any old threefold, but a threefold that has a past, a past-ish, a present-ish, and a future-ish way of happening.

195
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,640
And that's what happened.

196
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,440
He's doing that.

197
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,039
The terror chapter is, I guess I said, I say half the story last time.

198
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,400
Let's tell you the other half.

199
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:17,599
The Terric chapter is in a certain sense empty because it just names the phenomena you've already got.

200
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,919
On the other hand, it's crucial.

201
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,200
And why would it be crucial?

202
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,039
Well, that's what we're just discussing.

203
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,639
Because it's the move from the structure of being in to temporality.

204
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:46,359
It's the first place where he tells you that the structure of being in, when you say it, when you define terror the way he's defined it, it's already got a past, present, and future relationship.

205
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:59,960
So the unity, the wholeness, and the temporality story is all being introduced here, but it's being introduced in a way that, as I keep saying, gives you no new phenomena, no new arguments, no new problems.

206
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,720
But architectonically, structurally, this is the culmination of Division I.

207
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:14,039
So you get these things like existentiality, that's future, facticity, that's past.

208
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,039
Being fallen, that's present.

209
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:28,279
So I'm going to, now that I've let out this secret, I'm just going to talk in terms of past, present, and future when I refer to these threefolds because that's easier, and that's why I gave you the chart.

210
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,359
So you'll see what's happening.

211
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,480
And now we're on 236.

212
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:39,720
And we start hearing about the way this is going to look temporal.

213
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,639
At the top of the top paragraph on 236, 191 in the German.

214
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,919
Dasein is an entity for which in its being, that being is an issue.

215
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,880
You're used to all this.

216
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:57,160
The phrase is an issue has been made plain in the state of being of understanding.

217
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,799
That's the self as self-projecting.

218
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,919
Being towards its ownmost ability to be.

219
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:11,000
This potentiality is that for the sake of which a Dasein is as it is, and so forth.

220
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,480
He's reviewing all that, but he's setting it up so that he can finally make it sound future.

221
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,319
So let's skip a little and go on.

222
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:26,640
But ontologically, being towards one's own most ability to be means that in each case, Dasein is already ahead of itself.

223
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,200
That's beginning to sound futurish in its being.

224
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:38,079
Dasein is always beyond itself, not as a way of behaving towards other entities, which it's not, but as a being toward the ability to be, which it is itself.

225
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:45,359
This structure of being, which belongs to the essential is an issue, we shall denote as Dasein's being ahead of itself.

226
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,720
And being ahead of itself is clearly a future thing, the way Heidegger is talking about it.

227
00:19:51,039 --> 00:20:04,160
It's this goal, which isn't a goal, this role which is organizing everything you do, and which is something you take over.

228
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:11,039
That's the future dimension of being Dasein.

229
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:20,960
And now you're going to get, and what would be, and what would just, again, it helps me and it helps you, I think, to sort of see how much you've got of this.

230
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:40,720
What would have to be the past if this business of aiming towards a never-arrived at, so to speak, quotes, goal, which isn't really a goal, that's understanding, that's where you are headed, that's the being ahead of yourself.

231
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,399
Well, what would be the past version of that?

232
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:55,919
This is really sort of the light ought to go on in your head when you see how all these crazy terms are going to fit together now.

233
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,679
Well, you have to take up what you already got.

234
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:14,440
You've got to take up your nationality, your gender, given to you by your culture, and your own way of looking at things given to you by your family and your own physical, all that thrownness.

235
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,240
That's what you get, and you've got it always already.

236
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,760
Because whenever you start taking a stand, that's what you're taking a stand on.

237
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:27,319
The on, you already are.

238
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,919
Where's the chart again?

239
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,919
We're in the well, facticity.

240
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,480
The thrownness isn't one name for the column, but we're really in the facticity name.

241
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:52,760
In Dasein's way of being, facticity, which is, and now you go down one level, to the care structure, you have to learn to read this, is being already in the world.

242
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,839
And as soon as you introduce the already, you're in the past dimension.

243
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:07,639
This is what's already given, on the basis of which you will make your projection into the primordial future and take your stand on.

244
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
So now we've got to read that.

245
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,480
But you ought to be able to figure it out on your own now.

246
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,000
But the middle paragraph on 236.

247
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,200
But this structure pertains to the whole of Dasein's constitution.

248
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,240
Being ahead of itself does not signify anything like a tendency of world subject and so forth.

249
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,879
To being in the world, however, belongs the fact that it has been delivered over to itself.

250
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:33,319
That's the throwing.

251
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,160
That's the facticity.

252
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,760
That is, it has in each case been thrown into the world.

253
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,839
That's already happened.

254
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:48,919
Whenever you become Dasein at the age of, I don't know, whatever number of months it takes to get to be a Dasein once you've been born.

255
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,640
You don't have it right away, I'm sure, but you get it.

256
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,279
Anyway, whenever you've got it, you've already got a lot of, remember the Japanese baby example.

257
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:10,559
By a few months, the Japanese baby's already got its kind of understanding of being, and I guess a rudimentary understanding of its own being, and so do the American babies, and they're different.

258
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,679
So the abandonment of Dasein to itself is shown with primordial concreteness in anxiety.

259
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,279
We don't care about that right now.

260
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,559
Being ahead of itself means, if we grasp it fully, ahead of itself in already being in the world.

261
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,679
So now you've got two of them, these pieces that he wants you to get.

262
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,799
And what else?

263
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,559
What will be the present?

264
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:55,359
If the future is your sense of your role or your for the sake of which, to use the language you're used to, if the future is for the sake of which, which is always, which is never going to be arrived at, but is always to be done, and your past is your facticity, which is always already there, what's your present?

265
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,760
What are we doing right now?

266
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,400
Well, presumably, coping or dealing with things and people.

267
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,680
You're dealing with me and the lecture and your pen and your notebook and so forth.

268
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,599
That's what you're doing right now.

269
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,039
The present, you don't deal in the future, you deal right now.

270
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,919
You don't deal in the throwin'ness, that's done already.

271
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,599
You deal in the present.

272
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,399
You are, and now look at the chart again, you are amidst entities.

273
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,799
That is people and things.

274
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,599
So that's the present part of it.

275
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,439
Now all we have to do is read it.

276
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,039
On 236, we did throwiness.

277
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,519
230.

278
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,880
Okay, we're ready for 237.

279
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:52,359
Yeah, right, at the very top of 237, below the middle of 192 in the German.

280
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:02,279
It is, it says at the bottom of 236, that is, Dasein is, always also absorbed in the world of its concern.

281
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,480
That's what we just said.

282
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,399
The present is the being absorbed in dealing with things.

283
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,240
And that is, never mind the falling.

284
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,839
Well, I mean, remember, falling can also mean absorbed.

285
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:21,480
In this falling, that is, falling to work, getting absorbed.

286
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:36,119
In this falling, being amidst, eh, oh, well, I don't want to say, then we get into fleeing in the face of uncanniness and unsettledness, and we don't amount to, let's see where it becomes okay again, announces itself.

287
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,199
Well, what announces itself?

288
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,760
Well, the end of the paragraph.

289
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:55,560
Ahead of itself, being already in a world, essentially includes one's falling, falling to work, and one's being amidst those things ready to hand within the world with which one concerns oneself.

290
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,440
That's pretty clear.

291
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,159
That's the middle dimension.

292
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,079
Now we've got all that.

293
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,599
Let's see where I am.

294
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,480
So you're always absorbed in actual dealing.

295
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,559
And now, as if somehow this was a great aha, we're going to call this structure tear.

296
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:17,799
It's only a new name.

297
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,760
It's a new name for what we've just described.

298
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,599
It's a new name.

299
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,760
We've already described the phenomena over the last few months.

300
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:35,839
We've already named the three aspects just now: being already in and being amidst and being ahead.

301
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,799
And now we're just going to name that structure.

302
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,240
And we're going to call it care.

303
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,639
You could have called it anything, I suppose.

304
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,480
And it's a name that is the structure of Dase.

305
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,080
It's a name for that structure.

306
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,439
237.

307
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,599
He says it in the next paragraph.

308
00:26:53,599 --> 00:27:00,880
And he says it in a way that's related to the original way he says we can formally indicate it.

309
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:09,039
The formally existential totality of Dasein's ontological structural whole, and see, we got the whole thing now.

310
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,960
He said we were going to do that, must therefore be grasped in the following structure.

311
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:21,039
The being of Dasein means ahead of itself, being already in the world, as being amidst entities encountered within the world.

312
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,519
This being falls, fills in the signification of the term care.

313
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:34,159
You never know whether to cheer or to say ho huh, which is used in a purely ontological existential manner.

314
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,679
That's important, because if there was any content in the notion of care, he wants to take it out.

315
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,360
He wants to make it clear that care isn't a question, as he says, of worrying.

316
00:27:48,480 --> 00:28:01,519
As in English, the notion of cares, the cares of the world, the same kind of connotation is in the German word zorga, which is the word that rightly gets translated as care.

317
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:10,199
And just, and since we're not talking, and he says we're not talking about the cares of the world, we're not talking about the worries.

318
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:20,839
And in fact, and this is a funny thing, we're not talking about any experiences because he wants you to see that it's completely formal structure.

319
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:29,799
It can be the structure of worrying, it can be the structure of nurturing, it can be the structure of fleeing, it can be the structure of authentic facing up.

320
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,799
It's a structure.

321
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:39,079
It's not supposed to have any sort of experiential content.

322
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:51,319
I have to tell you that I'm stressing this partly because, in a way, I made such a fool of myself the one time I talked to Heidegger, which I didn't know very much German, and I'd only read Being in Time once.

323
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:54,119
Can you imagine how little I understood, read it once in German?

324
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,640
It wasn't in English yet.

325
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,000
But I did have the chance to talk to Heidegger, but I thought I better ask him some sensible question.

326
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,560
I couldn't really think of any sensible question.

327
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:12,279
But I said, you know, I said, I planned and I said, you know, Zorg in English gets translated care.

328
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:21,799
And care could mean something like an artist's care of their work, and it could mean something like love and nurturing.

329
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,720
And does that bother you?

330
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:30,839
Well, it shouldn't bother him when you know what he's talking about, because nothing, it doesn't mean, care doesn't mean anything like that.

331
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,920
Care just means a structure.

332
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,840
But he was very polite, and he said, no, it doesn't bother me at all.

333
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:44,120
By care, I want to cover every way that being gets to me, that Zion gate me on.

334
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,799
And that's, even that, when I say it now, seems a bit too much to say.

335
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,279
But I mean, all he really wants to say is it's the structure of a being that takes a stand on its being.

336
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,799
I sort of seduced him into missing his own point.

337
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:13,920
That he's missing his own point all over the place in here, because he keeps sort of falling into talking about the sort of feelings that might go with care, even though he says it's definitely not worry.

338
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:23,919
And he also says, and it's very important, it isn't even meant to say that, let me see where I am, that there's a priority of the practical.

339
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:40,479
You might think, well, at least the care structure shows that coping with things is more basic than theory, or at least it better include a reference to that, because that's a very important Heidegger thesis: that doing theory is privative.

340
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:50,239
You've got to start with the ready-to-hand and then leave out the situatedness and get to the present at hand, and then leave out even the substances with properties.

341
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,720
We'll talk about that next time, and then you get to the pure present at hand.

342
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,080
And that looks sounds all as if the priority of the practical.

343
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:17,760
But it's not because he says, and rightly, that of course theory is also covered by care, because theory is another way that being gets to me, or even better, theory is just has as much of a care structure as anything else.

344
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,120
I mean, because anything Dasein does is going to have this structure.

345
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,400
And he says that on 238.

346
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:32,480
So he's constantly sort of emptying out any attitude.

347
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,920
Look at this on 238, and you see him doing it.

348
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,720
The first full paragraph at the end of bottom of 193.

349
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:49,560
Care as a primordial structural totality lies before every factical attitude.

350
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,960
And even theory is a factical attitude.

351
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,720
Any situation of Dasein, and it does so existentially a priori, it means that it always lies in them.

352
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,360
So this phenomenon by no means expresses a priority of the practical over the theoretical.

353
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:12,760
When we ascertain something present at hand by merely beholding it, this activity has the character of care just as much as does a political action and so forth.

354
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,799
Theory and practice are possibilities of being for entity whose being must be defined as care.

355
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,719
So you just get used to this after a while.

356
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:28,839
It's supposed to be just a general name for the general structure of the kind of being that takes a stand on its being.

357
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,359
Anybody want to say anything about it?

358
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,639
I'm just talking and talking.

359
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,680
And it isn't as if there's much to question.

360
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,720
I can see that.

361
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,760
I mean, that's sort of because he's just sort of stipulating things.

362
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,879
He's not arguing for anything, and he's not describing anything.

363
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,799
So I'm not surprised you don't have any objections or any problems.

364
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,639
So I'll just go on until you do.

365
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:51,959
It's not a feeling.

366
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,319
It's not an attitude.

367
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,240
It's just a formal structure.

368
00:32:55,479 --> 00:33:02,199
You've got it both in its inauthentic form, in its undifferentiated form, in its authentic form.

369
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:11,160
He talks a little about that on 237, the inauthentic and undifferentiated mode at the bottom of 237.

370
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:19,480
The authentic for the sake of which has not been taken hold of.

371
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:24,559
The projection of one's own ability to be has been abandoned to the disposal of the they.

372
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,720
Well, as he's talking about, well, I can't just jump in like that, can I?

373
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:29,760
I have to start the paragraph.

374
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:42,160
In being ahead of itself, as being towards one's own most ability to be, lies the existential ontological condition for the possibility of being free for authentic existential possibilities.

375
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,279
Right, of course.

376
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,640
Why not?

377
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,279
And also, it, of course, the possibility of being inauthentic, which is where I jumped in.

378
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,719
And then the authentic hasn't been taken hold of.

379
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,799
That is, you don't, and we should read this because it always helps to hear it.

380
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,400
The projection of one's own ability to be has been abandoned to the disposal of the they.

381
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,439
You know, that's another way of saying what being inauthentic is.

382
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:21,520
You take over your public role and you do what your family and your neighbors and your culture tells you you ought to be doing, and that's either.

383
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
He's never very clear in sorting it out.

384
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:30,639
I want to say that can come in two flavors: the either undifferentiated, which is, I take it, what kids do.

385
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:39,600
I mean, they're not going to be fleeing yet from anxiety into some public role so as to look respectable.

386
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,719
And I think they're still in an undifferentiated mode.

387
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,279
But sooner or later, you get so that you have to take on some role.

388
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:50,639
People ask you, what do you want to be, a fireman or a policeman or a teacher?

389
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:57,040
And then you have to start thinking about these things and maybe even sort of focusing on doing something about them.

390
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:10,279
And then you're in the inauthentic mode because you take over some stand on your being that's not, that's general and public and just, well, that's all.

391
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:21,160
It doesn't capture what is something like going to be, if you're authentic someday, your unique style of doing whatever you're doing.

392
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:34,360
So, so look, so you get in, so he brings in the authentic and the and the undifferentiated on 237 and the authentic also on 237, all of that at the bottom there in a hurry.

393
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:37,960
And that's and now, but now he's doing a new thing.

394
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:47,400
He wants to say that this is also all versions of the structure.

395
00:35:47,399 --> 00:36:19,640
Whether you're authentic and have an authentic for the sake of which, whether you have a public role, or, and this is a funny one, you even have this general structure, I guess, and have a for the sake of which, no matter what you're doing, it's it's all whatever it is that's sort of the end toward which your activity is heading counts as a for the sake of which and seems to count as the you know the future dimension of this.

396
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:26,760
He says this on 239 in a way that I'm not sure whether he's a good idea or a bad idea for him to say it.

397
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:33,080
The middle of the page, he says, no, five lines, four lines down where it says hence in italics.

398
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:39,079
Hence to any willing there belongs something willed, which has already made itself definite in terms of a for the sake of which.

399
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,639
If willing is to be possible ontologically, the following items are constituted for it.

400
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,480
The prior disclosedness of the for the sake of which, in general, the ahead of itself.

401
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:53,080
See, he's now going to map even this on care.

402
00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:55,039
That's only why it's interesting.

403
00:36:55,279 --> 00:37:07,039
So there's the disclosedness of the for the sake of which, whichever, the very general for the sake of which, whatever, for whatever point this has for you, that's the being ahead of itself.

404
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,760
It's not anymore seemingly taking a stand on your being.

405
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,440
It's just any old.

406
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,240
Whatever.

407
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:16,079
See, if I'm lecturing now for the sake of being a teacher, that's neat.

408
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,959
That's a big deal.

409
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:26,799
But if I'm eating lunch for the sake of nourishing myself, that's still got this future for the sake of which dimension.

410
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,639
And it's also covered by care.

411
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,000
I mean, he's taking, he's sort of taking any content out of it except the temporal.

412
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:42,080
So if willingness to be possible, then we've got a prior disclosedness of the for the sake of which in general, that's being ahead of itself.

413
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,279
The disclosedness of something which we can concern ourselves.

414
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:47,440
That could be teaching, but it could be eating.

415
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,000
The world is the wherein of being already.

416
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:51,840
No, sorry, that's the past, isn't it?

417
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,080
Okay, that is, there's something which is already there, which we can concern ourselves.

418
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,360
I'm not sure now which is which.

419
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,919
The prior disclosedness of the for the sake of which in general.

420
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:09,360
The disclosedness of some don't concern ourselves.

421
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,000
Balzine's projection of itself.

422
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:12,880
Huh.

423
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:14,319
Look at that.

424
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:16,879
I've always read this wrong.

425
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,319
Not that it matters.

426
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,640
But anyway, it looks like you could play it either way.

427
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,520
But he's, the prior disclosedness of the for the sake of which in general is the past.

428
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,720
That's the priors.

429
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:36,400
What in the world the prior disclosedness of the for the sake of which in general is supposed to?

430
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:39,400
But now that's the being ahead of itself.

431
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:44,440
So then comes the next one, which is the throneness, being already.

432
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,840
And then comes what?

433
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:54,200
The third, Dasein's projection of itself towards a possibility.

434
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,719
Gee, I don't know.

435
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,559
I mean, I know what he's got.

436
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,519
He's got to say.

437
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,160
Let's just see.

438
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:00,760
I don't know why he's saying it.

439
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:10,039
But he's got, so the prior disclosedness of the for the sake of which in general, that's got to be the future, being ahead of itself.

440
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,400
That's how I read it.

441
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:15,879
The disclosedness of something which one concerns oneself with, that's got to be the present.

442
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:18,200
That's the right way to read it.

443
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:28,360
And now Dasein's projection of itself understandingly upon a potentiality for being towards a possibility of the entity willed, that sounds like the future too.

444
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,879
So what happened to the past?

445
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:32,839
Hell, I don't know.

446
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:35,720
I mean, anybody, can you make sense of that?

447
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:46,279
For the prior, let's see, the prior disclosedness of the for the sake of which in general.

448
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,239
It's okay, so it's ontologically prior, but is that going to help any?

449
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,159
Why does there have to be a freefall?

450
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:03,400
Well, there usually is, and he's talking this sort of language of the being already, being ahead of itself.

451
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,080
The other two seem to be in the jargon of temporality, and then one of them isn't.

452
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:21,000
And these are all ways of looking at the future, all three.

453
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:26,880
And the, oh, are all kinds, each of the three is futurish?

454
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,159
Let's see if that works.

455
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:33,359
The private further say to, so there's this general characteristic, no.

456
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,559
No, I give up.

457
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,079
I don't, I, I, okay, I'll hear another person, but it looks to me like it's it's uh something I don't want to sink into.

458
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:46,079
But go ahead if you think you can 237, okay.

459
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:54,639
The paragraph says that kind of itself, Es already in the world, essentially two points orange and once being alongside.

460
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,799
I see this focus on care and focusing on being ahead of itself.

461
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:12,799
And by talking about being ahead of itself, he already includes a talk sounds connected to the end quote, and whether or not it's actually focused explicitly to the modern issue.

462
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:17,999
Well, even if you're not talking about okay, well, there is.

463
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:19,200
Where are you reading?

464
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,840
I seem to where the work, which paragraph?

465
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,879
Okay, the paragraph that's not beginning there, but already going on on the top.

466
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:35,840
Okay, now where is ahead of itself, the last sentence?

467
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:54,240
Ahead of itself, the last sentence of the top paragraph of 237, ahead of itself, being already in a world, essentially includes one's falling and one's being amidst those things ready to hand within the world with which one concerns oneself.

468
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,519
That's the usual ones.

469
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,559
What's those major?

470
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,519
They're all there.

471
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:08,640
The ahead of itself includes falling in with the myths and the which are the things that you're coping with.

472
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:16,599
The one thing I think, though, that you're saying that's important, you might remember this and try to figure it out someday, particularly when you get to Division II.

473
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:20,440
There is a kind of priority for the future, Heidegger says.

474
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:27,479
It's as if the three dimensions of temporality are all equiprimordial, except one is more equiprimordial than the others.

475
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:29,000
And it's a funny claim.

476
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,319
But you can sort of hear it happening here.

477
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:36,119
I mean, it's why would somebody be taking up something of their thrownness?

478
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:43,080
And why would they be coping at all if it weren't that they are called to take a stand on their being?

479
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:53,560
And because they're always, Dasein is always having to take a stand on its being, of course it has to take up what it's got, and of course it has to do something.

480
00:42:53,560 --> 00:43:09,719
But there is a certain way in which Heidegger does definitely, he says that the future is for a being like Dasein, the future is somehow the most basic, most primordial dimension.

481
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,400
Maybe that's what's happening here.

482
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:12,839
I'm not going to spend any more time on it.

483
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,399
Come and tell me in office hours if you solve it.

484
00:43:15,879 --> 00:43:24,680
He goes into all this talk about willing and then about addiction and wishing and all this stuff on 230.

485
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,520
I don't know why he's doing this.

486
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,039
It's not interesting.

487
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,680
It's not very relevant.

488
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:48,840
He's trying to show that even care, even though care is empty as far as sort of having any experiential content, it's got a kind of formal structure which enables you to define willing, what else, urges, addictions, and so forth.

489
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:53,080
I never have thought I never got anything out of this.

490
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:59,359
And I don't, so I'm not going to try to say anything about it unless I have to.

491
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,560
Nobody makes me, I'm going to go on.

492
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Okay, so there's this general structure.

493
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:13,200
And 239, I want to say now.

494
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Well, that's just the part I don't understand.

495
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,120
I'm not going to get back into that, but I better mark it here.

496
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,959
But one thing, let's go on to the really sort of relevant issues.

497
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:31,439
On 241, he points ahead to a temporality.

498
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:37,680
I mean, there are hints here of what's going to happen in Division II, which are important and interesting.

499
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,040
So at the top, three lines down of 241, 196.

500
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:48,959
In the end, it will be shown, in the end, means in Division II, so you get a preview.

501
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:56,479
In the end, it will be shown that the idea of being in general is just as far from being simple as it is the being of Dasein.

502
00:44:56,479 --> 00:44:57,680
That's the first thing.

503
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,680
Being in general is going to not be something simple like substance.

504
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,879
It's got to have in it present-at-hand being, ready-to-hand being, and Dasein's being.

505
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,560
Remember, that was what I said in the first lecture.

506
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:21,839
And now he's saying that this complicated structure is going to at least have this kind of temporal structure.

507
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,120
So in defining care as being ahead of itself, I'm just going on where I was on 241.

508
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:36,160
In defining care as being ahead of itself, in being already in, as being alongside, you see, it's always the same threefold.

509
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,640
We have made it plain that even this phenomenon is in itself structurally articulated.

510
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,719
That's the kind of articulation of something that has structural joints.

511
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:51,720
That this is not a phenomenal symptom that we must pursue the ontological question even further.

512
00:45:51,720 --> 00:46:10,760
But is this not a phenomenological symptom that we must pursue the ontological question even further until we can exhibit it still more primordial, a still more primordial phenomenon, which provides the ontological support for the unity and the totality of the structural manifoldness of care?

513
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,680
Now, what could that be?

514
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:35,720
This time you know, temporality, which is going to come up in Division II of a book called Being and Time, about the multiple meanings of being, all of which get their structural unity and wholeness out of the fact that they are all variations on temporality, which is the primordial phenomenon.

515
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,560
If we follow up this question, we must look back and appropriate with greater precision.

516
00:46:41,879 --> 00:46:52,760
Sorry, before we follow up this question, we must look back and appropriate with greater precision what we have hitherto interpreted in aiming at the question of fundamental ontology and meaning in general.

517
00:46:52,760 --> 00:47:20,760
Okay, then comes this stupid story, which I told you not to read, but if you read it, you read it at your own peril, because it just reinforces the idea that somehow sorgho has something to do with worries, and it seems to have something to do with sort of attitudes, because in the middle of 243, he says that terror signifies also carefulness and devotedness.

518
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,400
You see, that's like an answer to my stupid question.

519
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,680
He shouldn't be saying that.

520
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:30,879
It doesn't signify carefulness and devotedness.

521
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,479
It doesn't signify any of any particular mood.

522
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,560
So why is he going on like that?

523
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,679
That I don't know.

524
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,440
That's why I said don't read it.

525
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:52,799
So when he gets back to his, gets his head back on 244, he makes a general point, which is very important, about eight lines down.

526
00:47:52,799 --> 00:48:02,240
The transcendental generality of the phenomenon of care and of all fundamental existentiality is, on the other hand, I mean, what's the other hand?

527
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,360
Uh-oh.

528
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,039
It's hard at the top.

529
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,680
The generalization is one that is ontological and a priori.

530
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,279
Oh, back to here.

531
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:21,680
So the story he's been telling you, this temporal structure story, isn't an ontical generalization.

532
00:48:23,919 --> 00:48:36,000
That would just mean that ontologically all men, all man's ways of behaving are full of care and are guided by his devotedness to something, which is just what that story seems to have told us and shouldn't have.

533
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,559
But now comes the formal thing again.

534
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,120
The generalization is rather one that is ontological and a priori.

535
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:50,079
What it has in view is not a set of ontical properties constantly emerging, but a state of being which is underlying in every case.

536
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,599
I just keep stressing that.

537
00:48:52,319 --> 00:49:00,000
Skipping one sentence, the existential condition for the possibility of the cares of life, that's the wrong reading of care.

538
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:06,799
The cares of life and devotedness, that's me saying to Heidegger, well, are you going to include caring about people?

539
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:08,879
The answer is, sure, why not include everything?

540
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:18,520
Must be conceived as care in a sense which is primordial, that is ontological, and again, that means structural.

541
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:27,079
So now, we can get the conclusion with cleared of all the confusions, where it says 200 in the margin.

542
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,519
The transcendental generality in quotes.

543
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,839
What this generality means is really interesting.

544
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:34,039
I'll talk about it in a minute.

545
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:46,360
Of the phenomenon of care and of all fundamental existentialia is, on the other hand, broad enough to present a basis on which every interpretation of Dasein, which is ontical and belongs to a worldview, must move.

546
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,600
Well, that's a really strong claim.

547
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:58,120
That's a kind of Kantian seeming claim that we've now got the structure of that kind of being, which Dasein is.

548
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,400
It's a priori, whatever that means in Heidegger.

549
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:03,399
It's more than just general.

550
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:06,440
It's got transcendental generality.

551
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:16,040
But he doesn't claim, and this is why, and notice every interpretation of Dasein has to conform to it.

552
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:26,519
Why doesn't he just say then that it's universal and necessary, which is what Kant says when he gets to the point of telling us the structure of something or other?

553
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:28,519
Well, I'm not sure.

554
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,319
I think smart people who are hearing this should think about that.

555
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:37,000
If you've got something to say about it, that would be nice.

556
00:50:37,879 --> 00:50:38,680
Go ahead.

557
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:42,839
I mean, anything we can ever pretend outside of this thing?

558
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:51,319
Well, it what he doesn't cover, for instance, that's interesting.

559
00:50:51,439 --> 00:51:04,560
He's he's saying you you we might come across some wolf child, for instance, which was a hominoid, uh Homo sapiens-like organism that didn't have Daseine in it.

560
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,519
So you have to say, uh and maybe porpoises do have Daseine in them.

561
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,559
That's one thing.

562
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,560
He's saying anything that's a Daseine has got to have this structure.

563
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:24,879
And he's not taking a sort of anthropological or sociological or biological stand on how to tell which beings have the structure.

564
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:26,559
That seems okay.

565
00:51:32,399 --> 00:51:35,600
Well, no, I don't think Dasein, no, it wouldn't be indifference.

566
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:42,559
That's just another mode of being in of existing, I'm sure, for him.

567
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:53,119
Dasein can't ever get out of having this structure because even theory has this structure, which is pretty sort of like indifference.

568
00:51:53,120 --> 00:52:00,959
I mean, it's managing to get rid of all your own interests and just look at something completely, you know, like Descartes would.

569
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:06,480
Even Descartes has this structure, whether he likes it or not.

570
00:52:06,479 --> 00:52:15,520
Even when he's thinking geometry in a warm room and got rid of all his passions, which is what he said he had to do to write the meditations.

571
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:22,319
Now, what he's seen, I think, but this is not very definitive and not very exciting.

572
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:38,639
I think he thinks he can't conclude, like Kant, for the universality and necessity of this, but only claim that it is in fact general, and you won't, you can't find any if it is somehow definitive.

573
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,959
Here's what I think he thinks.

574
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,840
It's definitive of the structure of Dasein.

575
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:45,639
It won't count as Dasein unless it has this structure.

576
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,560
That sounds pretty necessary and universal.

577
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,680
But maybe he thinks he hasn't got any right to say that.

578
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,680
He hasn't got a transcendental argument.

579
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,720
How many of you had had the Concourse or are taking it concurrently?

580
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:09,639
Well, Kant would go to a lot of trouble to give you an argument to show that this was a priori, that is prior to experience, universal and necessary, this claim.

581
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:20,199
It's as if Heidegger makes the claim, but he doesn't call it universal and necessary, because I think he hasn't, there's no way to argue for it.

582
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:36,119
All he can do is sort of lay out the structure of Dasein and tell you that everything that you can think about and know about Dasein is going to have this structure.

583
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:40,440
And that's the transcendental generality of it.

584
00:53:41,879 --> 00:53:43,960
And that's pretty strong.

585
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:47,080
But for some reason or other, he's just not going...

586
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:55,159
He doesn't feel that he has a right to say, I think, that he has proven that claim.

587
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,439
I don't know what to make of it.

588
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,279
That's why I think people who are into this should have a view about this.

589
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:00,919
Yeah, David.

590
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,040
Well, that's one of his problems.

591
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,760
He's trying to get a justification for the causality of the transparency and so forth.

592
00:54:10,919 --> 00:54:14,199
That's why, you know, I speak about causality in terms of people.

593
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,999
Ah, but all the categories.

594
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:24,959
Well, don't all the categories have universality and necessity, substance and reciprocity and quality?

595
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,479
I mean there are twelve of them.

596
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:36,159
And I don't I mean you just got one of the twelve, but they all have uh they are all they're m in order in Kant, the what is it?

597
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,439
The transcendental unity.

598
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:39,680
I taught my daughter to say this at Cocktail Park.

599
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,479
It was a big hit.

600
00:54:40,479 --> 00:54:46,240
The transcendental unity of app perception is the condition of the possibility of objective knowledge in general.

601
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,399
That is a real conversation, Stopra.

602
00:54:48,399 --> 00:54:53,359
But but and that means that means not only causality, but substance, quantity, modality.

603
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:59,039
They're twelve, and they're all conditions of the possibility of objective experience in general.

604
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,680
I'm just quoting Kant, but we shouldn't be quoting Kant.

605
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,959
This is not a Kant course.

606
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:03,120
Yeah.

607
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,959
Well, that's one project.

608
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:09,839
I mean, that's how science...

609
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,640
That's the one of the projects of the critique of pure reason.

610
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,120
What about justifying math and geometry?

611
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,999
That's also a project of the critique of pure reason.

612
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:21,839
Anyway, I don't think we should worry about that.

613
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:22,480
Yes?

614
00:55:29,919 --> 00:55:31,999
It would, and he's not claiming to have one.

615
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:32,720
That's right.

616
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:47,999
You're going to be right at the open with a phenomenon where you can exclude any sort of category of structure or axioms which are going to happen.

617
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:49,760
Well, I think that's sort of right.

618
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,839
But then how and but how does he know then that he's not going to run into something that, you know, goes against what he's been saying?

619
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,959
And he knows that it covers every case of Dasein.

620
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:00,720
So that seems closed.

621
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,680
So something like most extreme openness.

622
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:05,999
Yeah?

623
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:14,920
I think the only a priori reminders is a priority.

624
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,319
But he just says it's a priori.

625
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:19,480
And he says it's transcendental.

626
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:21,399
That's a problem, isn't it, for what you're saying?

627
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:29,480
I mean, that's how what does transcendental in a priori mean if you're open to something coming along which contradicts what you just asserted?

628
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,439
Yeah, if we have deposits, bias, and the only explanation makes sense.

629
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:44,840
We're open to something different.

630
00:56:46,439 --> 00:56:56,680
Well, I think that's that's sort of right, has to be right, but I it says that what's happening with transcendental in a priori?

631
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:12,200
Why doesn't he just say what you just said, that phenomenology can have generality and it can make the claim that everything that it's come across so far fits into this generality, but who knows what might come around next?

632
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,080
I don't know.

633
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,839
I mean, I think that's a deep question about what he thinks he's doing, but I have no idea.

634
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:19,720
Oh, there's another candidate, by the way, I could just tell you.

635
00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:28,760
Husserl thinks that you can find essential structures by what he calls eidetic variation.

636
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,559
Don't worry about it.

637
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:38,520
You vary something with counterexamples until you find some essential structure that fits all the examples of whatever it is you want to define.

638
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:44,760
Maybe Heidegger thinks that he's got Husserlian kind of a priori.

639
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,399
I don't know.

640
00:57:45,399 --> 00:57:51,799
I don't want to say more about it because I like to raise questions that I think I can contribute to, and I can contribute to them.

641
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:53,319
So let's go on.

642
00:57:53,319 --> 00:58:00,479
We're almost done with the care section.

643
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,040
So let's go back to temporality.

644
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,039
Temporality is going to turn out.

645
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,799
I just want to help you find your way.

646
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,960
It took me years to understand this.

647
00:58:10,959 --> 00:58:13,040
This whole notion of meaning.

648
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,760
It turns out that temporality is the meaning of being.

649
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:24,880
And more even, it turns out that care is the meaning of Dasein.

650
00:58:24,879 --> 00:58:27,680
And the temporality is the meaning of care.

651
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,679
What kind of weird talk is that?

652
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,000
I mean, you can't, I took me ages to even have a story about it.

653
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:40,799
But he says that meaning is that in terms of which something, how does he put it, becomes accessible as something?

654
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:43,680
Let's go back to the top of the meaning chapter.

655
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,639
Help me find here.

656
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:50,560
Meaning on 193 is that wherein the intelligibility of something maintains itself.

657
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:59,760
The concept of meaning embraces the formal existential framework of what belongs to that which an understanding interpretation articulates and all that.

658
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,279
But the crucial italics is what I want now, the top of 193, the italics.

659
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:16,000
Meaning is the, on the basis of which of a projection, now the really crucial thing, in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something.

660
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:22,720
I take that to mean that he's using the word meaning just to fit the way he's been using the word care.

661
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:32,319
That is, meaning is that set of terms which makes some phenomena intelligible.

662
00:59:32,959 --> 00:59:37,599
Meaning is that in terms of which something makes sense.

663
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,520
And I think in terms of which is really important there.

664
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:46,920
So why is care the meaning of Dasein?

665
00:59:47,240 --> 01:00:08,120
Because once you get the term care and the already and the already in and the being amidst and the ahead of itself, those are the terms in which the unity of the sort of structure of Dasein makes sense.

666
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,039
I don't know, I mean, it's very abstract, but I think that's what he's doing.

667
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:17,480
But then now, and what would it be to say then that time is the meaning of care?

668
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:36,040
Well, it turns out that thinking of what he's going to call the primordial present, primordial future, and primordial past, giving you the terms in which to make sense of the most basic experience of temporality.

669
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:49,240
And so it's always the meaning story in there is always the story of when we have to find the right structured vocabulary to make sense of the phenomenon.

670
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,839
And you've just seen him do it.

671
01:00:50,839 --> 01:01:03,240
I mean, I keep saying it's boring, but at least we saw him find a term, care, and then find the substructures of it, the three structures of it.

672
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:12,119
And in terms of that, he thinks he's now found the unity and the wholeness of Dasein's basic structure of being in.

673
01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:36,960
And in Division II, he's going to tell you about the structure of temporality, and he's going to tell you that that's going to account for the unity and the wholeness of the hair structure, which he just asserts here, which he's going to find the right terms for talking about it when he gets to temporality.

674
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:48,240
And of course, they're all going to be, you're all looking very zonked out and understandably so, they are all going to be structures of a being that takes a stand on its being.

675
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:57,279
It's just, and he has to find more and more ways to articulate that structure and terms in which to describe it.

676
01:01:57,279 --> 01:02:02,960
That's, again, it's all sort of empty, but empty in a deep way, if that makes sense.

677
01:02:04,879 --> 01:02:24,319
And I think Heidegger thinks that what he said at the beginning of Division I, namely, that he's going to formally indicate Dasein as the being who takes a stand on its being, he's now done it.

678
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:34,080
That's what, that's maybe what he's saying on 274, which is beyond your reading because it's the beginning of Division II.

679
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:40,000
But it's so tied up with what we've just been reading that I think I should read it.

680
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,400
It's a kind of summary of what we've just been talking about.

681
01:02:44,879 --> 01:02:46,559
Right at the beginning of Division II.

682
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,720
What we have gained by our preparatory analysis of Dasein.

683
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,079
Oh, sorry, question.

684
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:57,199
What have we gained by our preparatory analysis of Dasein and what are we seeking?

685
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:10,520
In being in the world, whose essential structures center in disclosiveness, we have found the basic state of the entity we have taken as our theme.

686
01:03:10,839 --> 01:03:18,760
I take it he doesn't, he's not provisionally designating now that he's got the essential structure.

687
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:24,520
That's this transcendental generality, whatever that is, and that is that a priori thing.

688
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,839
He knows what the essential structure is.

689
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:31,640
The totality of being in the world as a structural whole has revealed itself as care.

690
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:40,600
You see, we didn't know, we provisionally named it, but we didn't know that it had this threefold structure, which we now know.

691
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,159
In care, the being of Dasein is included.

692
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:46,600
When we come to analyze this being, we took as our clue existence.

693
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:56,039
That was the provisional, which in anticipation, that was at the beginning, we designated as the essence of Dasein, but we didn't know it was the essence of Dasein.

694
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:08,119
This term, existence, formally indicates that Dasein is as an understanding of an ability to be, which in its being makes an issue that being for it.

695
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:12,119
And we now think that it's no longer a provisional.

696
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:20,999
I mean, now we just want to say, yeah, we've got the structure, which indicates that Dasein is this, the being that makes an issue for it.

697
01:04:20,999 --> 01:04:34,600
In every case, I'm myself the entity which in such a manner, by working out the phenomenon of care, we've given ourselves an insight into the concrete constitution of existence.

698
01:04:34,919 --> 01:04:38,839
And we're just skipping a little to the next paragraph.

699
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:45,480
He now wants to lay bare the horizon within which something like being in general becomes intelligible.

700
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,839
That's division two.

701
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:48,600
That's already pointing ahead.

702
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,079
Yeah.

703
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,600
Maybe.

704
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,919
To find a passage.

705
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:09,839
Okay, let's look.

706
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,479
It's not arbitrary.

707
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,359
Care is the right word for it.

708
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,239
I would like to know.

709
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:17,520
I would like him to say that.

710
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,640
That would be interesting.

711
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,479
Where does he say it?

712
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,399
Okay, let me read down there.

713
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,560
I read already the temporality part.

714
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,680
Let's go and finish it.

715
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:33,119
First, however, we must show that what is ontologically new in this interpretation is ontically quite old.

716
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:44,879
In explicating Dasein's being as care, we are not forcing it under the idea of our own contriving, that we are conceptualizing existentially what has already been disclosed in an ontico-existential manner.

717
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:54,480
Yet, I sort of skipped that on purpose because what follows is this sort of seemingly arbitrarily chosen story.

718
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,839
Does it solve the problem?

719
01:05:55,999 --> 01:06:02,799
What right do these Romans have to say that the cura is the right word for human beings?

720
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:06,959
Does it make any progress?

721
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,760
Okay, so I see, so well, isn't that, I mean, I'm not very happy with that, but I think Eugene is right.

722
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,640
That's what he thinks.

723
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:33,359
So lo and behold, we go back to this obscure Latin myth about cura, which is the Roman, or the Latin for care, in order, and as the myth claims that care is the structure of human beings.

724
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:39,399
And we, and that's sort of going to tell us, look at that.

725
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,079
All along, people knew this.

726
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:44,199
I mean, but it seems such a weird thing.

727
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:49,399
You could go to a million other myths that say a million other things, and this is not a very central one.

728
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:03,720
Oh, right, so this care and matter.

729
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:07,879
Okay, if you think of care, I mean, I'm sort of torn about this.

730
01:07:07,879 --> 01:07:09,879
I switch back and forth from year to year.

731
01:07:09,879 --> 01:07:13,239
That's why I keep stressing this year, it's the formalness.

732
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:17,319
But sometimes it seems it's the phenomena.

733
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,399
There is an actual experience of caring that he wants to refer to.

734
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,560
But then he'll also say, but this is very formal.

735
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:27,399
Don't think it has to do with worrying, don't think it has to do with practices.

736
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,119
So I don't know which is doing it.

737
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:39,159
It's about something that under, that's common to them all.

738
01:07:39,879 --> 01:07:42,839
But you get it by sort of abstracting from them.

739
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:43,959
That's the formal thing.

740
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:46,119
And then you find something common to them.

741
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:46,680
Yeah, okay.

742
01:07:46,839 --> 01:07:49,480
I'll leave it first to Curtis and then David.

743
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,119
Yeah.

744
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,680
Where are you?

745
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:08,199
Okay, good.

746
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,399
By being.

747
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,239
Where are you?

748
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:14,199
Where are you?

749
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:15,720
On 243.

750
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,479
How many?

751
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:18,919
Okay.

752
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,479
I don't see it yet, but do go ahead.

753
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,319
And the connection with how hard you use is pairs.

754
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:53,999
Okay.

755
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:58,640
I mean, I think that's right, but I think that's such a weird way of arguing.

756
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:08,319
It's such temporalities.

757
01:09:10,879 --> 01:09:11,439
Okay.

758
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,360
But I mean, he's got the phenomena there.

759
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,359
Because he can describe it, you know, with its threefold thing.

760
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:24,159
That this story sort of adds weight to that, to the whole thing that he's gone through here is just bizarre.

761
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,799
Yeah, right.

762
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:27,600
Okay.

763
01:09:27,919 --> 01:09:28,720
Well, okay.

764
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,720
Now David wants to say something.

765
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:44,560
If I care about something, it's what matters.

766
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:55,919
That's the phenomenal sort of locus where you connect it to meaning and significance, familiarity.

767
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:07,680
Yeah, but it's this is illuminating because I see more and more what the puzzle about it is to me.

768
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:12,119
I mean, mattering is already still too concrete.

769
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:19,399
At least Heidegger's view is that mattering goes with the Finnliche, with disposiveness, and is some one of these three dimensions.

770
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:30,519
Nothing you can say about care, which doesn't already make it take it away from its formalness, give it some kind of special meaning.

771
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:34,839
Even the very general meaning mattering is too specific, it seems to me.

772
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:36,919
I don't know.

773
01:10:36,919 --> 01:10:48,279
But I mean, it looks like he wants to say that mattering is going to be just another special case of it, though I don't know how you could make that case.

774
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:53,879
Mattering for Heidegger, he says, is given to you by moods.

775
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:54,999
It's one dimension.

776
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:57,399
It's the always-already dimension.

777
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,199
So I don't know what to do about that.

778
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:09,640
Now it turns out that mattering is the most, is the name for the fact that my being is an issue for me.

779
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:18,919
If that's mattering, then I can understand it, because that's the ultimate sort of thing that the structure that all is supposed to explicate.

780
01:11:18,919 --> 01:11:20,440
Well, I'm glad I brought it up.

781
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:24,760
And if anybody wants to sort of explain and defend this myth in here, that would be a nice thing.

782
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,999
I mean, Heidegger's not crazy or stupid.

783
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:29,479
There must be more in it than I see.

784
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:36,199
But be careful, because anything you say is likely to, so to speak, be held against you as not formal enough.

785
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,039
And I don't know what to do about that.

786
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:39,959
But I want to know, I've got three minutes.

787
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:44,680
I want to make sure that I finished half of what I was going to do today, at least.

788
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:53,560
So, Dasein has an essence, and it turns out we've got a grasp of that essence, and in a way, we've completed the job of Division I.

789
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,760
That's a good place to stop.

790
01:11:55,199 --> 01:12:08,079
But what I want to go on, at least a little tiny bit more, then comes the talk about we're going to take two old philosophical problems now.

791
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:09,760
In a way, we finished Division I.

792
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,199
So, that's the important thing.

793
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:17,519
But now, we're going to do on 244, section 43, Dasein, Worldhood, and Reality.

794
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,959
What's he doing there?

795
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:52,720
Well, he's saying now that we've got the structure of Daseine and we understand this, it's going to be very helpful if we draw some conclusions as to how the difference between thinking of Dasein as a self-sufficient substance and what it is when you think of Dasein as hair will buy you a new insight into epistemology, that is, how to deal with the problem of the external world, and a new insight into reality, how to deal with the, how to get out of idealism and realism.

796
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,879
And that's what he's going to do next.

797
01:12:54,879 --> 01:12:57,279
Now, that's what we're going to do next.

798
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,640
So, be sure and read.

799
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:04,879
You already read for the external world part, I think, at least I wanted you to for this time, but we didn't get there.

800
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:09,439
So, next time, we're going to do the external world and start the part on reality.

801
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,959
I want to say one more thing: don't worry when he talks a lot about Kant, Diltai, and Scheler.

802
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:16,479
You don't know these people.

803
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,919
You don't have to know these people.

804
01:13:17,919 --> 01:13:20,559
They've been forgotten, whereas Heidegger hasn't.

805
01:13:20,879 --> 01:13:23,999
Not quite forgotten, but well, not Kant, never mind.

806
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,479
I canceled that last sentence.

807
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:36,159
But you don't need to know Kant, Diltai, and Scheler to understand what he's talking about, and you couldn't waste your time sort of looking them up in the encyclopedia or trying to figure it out.

808
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:38,399
Just skip it.

809
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,680
Okay, that's the thing.
