1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
So this is going to be a rather complicated lecture.

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:06,960
I'll try to make it as clear as I can.

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:10,801
The situation is really confused and complicated.

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:32,720
I've been changing my mind every time I give the course for the last, I don't know, 30 years as to what Heidegger really thinks about science and realism, which is what I'm interested in, because I think he's in a position to have an interesting, important contribution to make.

5
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:47,600
But every time I try to deal with it, two things, there's always this constant debate between the idealists like Bill Blattner and the realists like me, and I think John Hoagland, maybe, or at least me.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,960
And it's not, and I'm beginning to see this time, it's no accident.

7
00:00:53,081 --> 00:01:11,321
I'm going to try to show that Heidegger has a view which should lead him to some kind of deflationary realism, some kind of view that there isn't any important difference between the reality of baseballs and the reality of electrons.

8
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,840
Second, he doesn't want that view.

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,801
It's no accident that having been a physics and math major as an undergraduate, he never got over it.

10
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,161
I understand that perfectly.

11
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,280
That happened to me too.

12
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:31,321
I mean, you really believe, if you've done some physics, that physics is telling you something about an independent reality.

13
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:45,160
So Heidegger wants to be what I'm calling a robust realist, but he hasn't really got the equipment to make the argument, so that he's sort of a dogmatic robust realist.

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,160
And it's even more complicated because he has the equipment to make the argument, he just doesn't use it.

15
00:01:51,160 --> 00:02:23,000
So you can make out of what is running around in Heidegger a coherent, I think convincing, robust realism position, namely that science studies the universe and it studies those beings in the universe, like electrons and galaxies and black holes and all that, and it studies their essential structure, and they have that structure, whether anybody ever studies them, whether we ever existed or not.

16
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:30,521
I mean, that's certainly what most scientists think they're doing, and it seems to me it's what they must be doing and ought to be doing.

17
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:37,641
That now, to get there from Heidegger is hard, but to get there any other way, as far as I know, is even harder.

18
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,680
So here we go.

19
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:42,081
So we're in the reality chapter.

20
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:53,761
To remind you, because it's been a while, last time it looked like the reality chapter is a kind of deflationary realism.

21
00:02:53,761 --> 00:03:03,280
After all, it shows that the world is, as I think I quoted Charles Haylor as saying, or maybe I just stole the term, the world is a co-production.

22
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,800
It's something that Dasein and nature together produce, like hammers.

23
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,081
I mean, you can't hammers are a co-production.

24
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:30,480
They have to fit into the referential hole, and that's Dasein, and it Dasein has to be there to have a referential hole because it connects up with Dasein's for the sake of which, finally, what it is to be a hammer.

25
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:38,400
But, of course, it also has to be have a present-at-hand causal basis, or you can't have a hammer.

26
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,400
As I keep saying, you can't hammer with pillows and ice and butter and all sorts of things, your bare hands either.

27
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
So there you are.

28
00:03:46,641 --> 00:04:02,160
But if reality is a co-production, then of course Heidegger is going to be a deflationary realist, not a robust realist, because you couldn't have you certainly can't have hammers if there aren't Daseins or around.

29
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,721
And maybe you can't have anything, any objects at all about Dasein.

30
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:18,960
Maybe out out there in the in the universe, so to speak, there's just chaos until we carve it up into what I mentioned last time, Ian Hacking calls functionally relevant groupings.

31
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,441
That is, we carve it up in ways that make sense and are useful to us.

32
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:57,641
Now, it's further complicated by the fact that even if it looks like nature and the universe are independent of us, we wouldn't be in a very good position to know because we will bring our four Haba, our four-having, our foreconception and all with us whenever we looked at the universe or the world.

33
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:03,960
And we wouldn't, and we don't know that we live inside this pervasive familiarity.

34
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:24,360
And there's really, you could say, no reason to think that we ever get outside or even could get outside the pervasive sense of familiarity and what it is to be, which we live inside of, but it's so pervasive and it's so much in our practices that we can't even see it.

35
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:35,720
And then you get the idea that scientists too are working in their familiar setting, their laboratory, and they have their forehaving about nature.

36
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,920
And even if nature was a co-production, maybe they wouldn't see it.

37
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,521
I mean, they might just think they're transparently getting it the way nature really is.

38
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,840
So what are we supposed to think of all that?

39
00:05:52,840 --> 00:06:10,960
Well, Heidegger says, and I think this is, we've got to believe this: that all beings depend for their intelligibility on our practices for encountering them, and yet all beings are independent of our practices for encountering them.

40
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,081
That's the deflationary realist story.

41
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:28,480
And see, it's something like it's we make sense of everything that we encounter, and that we make sense of it all as in some sense not dependent on our encountering it.

42
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,960
I mean, the it's uh where's the did I give away all the handouts?

43
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,840
Oh, here's one.

44
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,720
I'll get it.

45
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
Oh, oh, okay.

46
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,280
Thanks.

47
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,960
So look at number one now in your handout.

48
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,920
That's the statement of this.

49
00:06:44,241 --> 00:07:12,561
This is what I what I want what's interesting about this is that being or intelligibility depends on us seems so obviously Heideggerian and obviously true that it's the other thing that seems interesting and strange, namely that Heidegger could be some kind of co-production deflationary kind of realist and still claim that all the beings which we encounter don't depend on us.

50
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
But that's what he says.

51
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,800
Now this is from the history of the concept of time.

52
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,521
I hope.

53
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:21,600
I mean as I say that all of this got a little scrambled from the computer.

54
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,680
But wherever I'm and I'll give you a more reliable handout, but I mean the words are right.

55
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,521
The references might not be.

56
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:41,521
Anyway, the being of entities does not lie in the activity of encountering, but the encounter of entities is the phenomenal basis and the sole basis upon which the being of entities can be grasped.

57
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:43,680
That's all good old Heidegger.

58
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,161
So that's we make the clearing, and then things show up in it.

59
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,841
But he says only the interpretation of the encounter with entities can secure the being of entities, if at all.

60
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:58,041
That's all the being is relative to us part.

61
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:01,160
Now comes the beings are independent of us part.

62
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:12,521
It must be stated that the entity, fix that, the word is designed, and you can translate that the totality of entities, because the entity doesn't make any sense.

63
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:13,801
They're what entity.

64
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:25,561
So it must be stated that the totality of entities as a totality of entities is in itself and independent of any apprehension of it.

65
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:47,321
Accordingly, I think you might better say yet, yet the being of the totality of entities is found only in encounter and can be explained and made understandable only from the phenomenal exposition, exhibition, and interpretation of the structure of encounter.

66
00:08:47,320 --> 00:09:00,041
So that's a funny paragraph, you see, because he's talking about the totality of entities as they are in themselves and independent of any apprehension we have of them.

67
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:09,321
And he's saying, of course, all access we have to them is our access and is a function of our practices.

68
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
That's hard to understand.

69
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,881
No wonder it keeps generating.

70
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:25,321
If you believe half of it, it sounds like obviously everything we ever experience depends on us in the sense that it fits into our referential totality.

71
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:40,801
And it also seems to be saying, of course, anything we encounter, we encounter and apprehend it as it is, quote, in itself, where in itself always or normally is taken to mean without any reference to us.

72
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:43,121
That's the continuous in itself.

73
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:54,160
Now, Heidegger can't quite be meaning that by in itself, but he means something like: everything we come across, we come, except things that we made or something.

74
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:04,481
But I mean, most of the entities we come across, we come across them as existing in their own right, independent of whether we come across them or not.

75
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:08,400
I mean, that's it's all it's true, both of them.

76
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,121
And now the question is how to get it together.

77
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:35,121
And before we go further, this isn't something just said, of course, in the history of the concept of time, which is written a year before being in time, but it's said in its most dramatic form in being in time, in a place where I've already cited it once, but the whole text of this lecture and the previous one is in these two sentences.

78
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:40,241
They're on 228, first full paragraph.

79
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:41,521
I read it last time.

80
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:48,001
Entities are quite independently of the experience by which they are disclosed.

81
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:50,881
That's the realism part.

82
00:10:50,881 --> 00:11:00,961
The acquaintance with which they are discovered and the grasping in which their nature is, that isn't in the German, by the way, in which, and that might be important.

83
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:06,241
So, discovered and the grasping by which they are ascertained.

84
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:17,681
I don't know how it I it's the grasping by which they are experienced, I guess, whatever, something like that.

85
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,920
I'd have to go back and look, but I wrote in the margin that the nature is not in the German.

86
00:11:22,241 --> 00:12:36,281
I'm on 184 two-thirds 183 two-thirds of the way down help me see what what's going on there this the paragraph that begins entities are at the end of that sentence in they're independent of the acquaintance in which they're discovered that's fine and the grasping in which something is all empty and responsible unfortunately I couldn't hear you so anyway it wouldn't help everybody else so what I'm looking for at the end of the sentence I don't think there's any nature in there though it would be fine if there were so how do you do it without nature independent of yeah okay okay how it is entertained that's that that's fine instead of ascertained because ascertained is okay I see it is ascertained okay but it's turning it's going to turn out that Heidegger really thinks that they have a nature, so the fact that it doesn't show up there isn't going to make a big deal later.

87
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,681
But now, that's the way the entities are.

88
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,201
Independent of our experience of them, our discovery of them, our grasping of them.

89
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:56,201
But being is only in the understanding of those entities in whose being something like an understanding of, to whose being, something like an understanding of being belongs.

90
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,160
Who are they?

91
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,241
That's us, of course.

92
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:03,561
So being depends on us, but entities don't.

93
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,041
That's the same old puzzle again.

94
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:13,121
And one more time, because since, as I say, that puzzle is what we're going to be puzzling about the whole lecture.

95
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:17,361
So on 255, he comes back to it.

96
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,441
The first, no, the third full paragraph.

97
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:27,761
As we have noted, being, not entities, is dependent upon the understanding of being.

98
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,281
That's the half of it.

99
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,921
That is to say, reality, not the real, is dependent on care.

100
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
So it should be really to fill it out.

101
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,521
Being, yeah, not entities.

102
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,081
That's the two things.

103
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:48,641
Yeah, being is, but not entities are dependent on us.

104
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:55,361
And now he just says another way, which is weird: reality, not the real is dependent upon care.

105
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:04,321
If you hear that, if somebody said, look, Heidegger says reality depends on us, because we're certainly care, that's the structure of human beings.

106
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:13,041
If somebody said, well, Heidegger says reality depends on us, you'd certainly think, gee, he certainly is some kind of idealist, some kind of constructivist.

107
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,961
But then he goes on, and if somebody came around and said, Heidegger says the real doesn't depend on us, you'd think, gee, he's some kind of realist.

108
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,961
But he's both or neither.

109
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,681
He's trying to have it both ways.

110
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,641
And it's a long story, I think, how he thinks he gets it both ways and how he should do it and so forth.

111
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:33,920
So on we go.

112
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,881
Feel free to interrupt me when I lose you.

113
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:41,280
I try to go slow and illustrate what I'm saying as I go.

114
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:55,161
So it looks, both of those claims look like deflationary realisms, if Heidegger invented deflationary realism, because they apply equally to electrons and baseballs, right?

115
00:14:56,601 --> 00:15:01,321
The reality of them depends on us, and they don't.

116
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:08,841
How many baseballs and how many electrons there are running around in the universe is not, doesn't depend on us.

117
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:17,561
But somehow, what it is to be an electron maybe depends on us, and what it is to be a baseball certainly depends on us.

118
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:24,601
And at the level of deflationary realism, there's no important difference.

119
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:30,440
That's what it makes, that's what makes a deflationary realist to think that there's no important difference.

120
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,481
Yes.

121
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:43,241
An entity itself, in itself, entity, I couldn't hear you yet, in its being?

122
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,080
In itself, in its being.

123
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:48,840
Yes, probably.

124
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,601
An entity in its being, I think you're asking a hard and good question.

125
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:59,241
I mean, let's just ask about the being of hammers or baseballs, either one.

126
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:09,800
The hammer in itself is what is around whether anybody happens to be using it or knowing it's there or not.

127
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,400
And so the hammer in a certain way, some way doesn't depend on us.

128
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:18,201
But the being of the hammer does depend on us.

129
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:25,001
That is, what it is to be a hammer is determined by our whole bunch of practices.

130
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:30,280
So it looks like the being of the hammer depends on us for sure.

131
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,560
And whether the hammer depends on us or not is part of the puzzle.

132
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,001
Heat.

133
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:52,001
Being depends on us, and even the being of the hammer depends on us, but entities like hammers are in themselves in the sense that they don't, in some way they don't depend on us.

134
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:54,080
And in some way they do depend on us.

135
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,880
Hammers.

136
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,160
Now remember I said last time you get the same thing with money that I got into with John Searle at one point.

137
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:08,721
He wants to say in general that we make up a representation of things and then it's up to the world whether there are any such things.

138
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:14,561
And with money you get the peculiar feature that without us there wouldn't be any such thing as money.

139
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,960
It's a result of our all agreeing to treat it as money.

140
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:25,040
On the other hand, it doesn't depend on us how much money there is or whether there is any money or whether we have any money.

141
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,721
The same puzzle occurs.

142
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:35,921
So the being of money depends on us, but somehow the entities, the dollar bills, don't depend on us.

143
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,761
They could be around after we are gone and so forth.

144
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:40,001
Yeah.

145
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:53,521
Speaking about the gear and also that original.

146
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:55,921
There's some kind of noise in the background.

147
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
Everybody has to talk louder from where I'm.

148
00:17:58,721 --> 00:17:59,360
I can't hear you.

149
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:16,800
Okay, well the hammer has certain observer relative properties that it has this potential to be used as a hammer.

150
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,800
But there's something like the being, what it is to be a hammer, depends on us in a different sort of way.

151
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,600
It's not something potential.

152
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,160
It's something about the way the hammer fits in with our practices.

153
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:33,080
It gets defined as what is used for hammering nails.

154
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,880
The potentiality stuff is in there because it's defined in terms of its use.

155
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,481
And therefore, what?

156
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,560
What it is to be a hammer depends on us.

157
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,960
Maybe it doesn't even have a potential for that.

158
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:58,921
So you're trying to tell me how it could be independent, even though it's use-dependent.

159
00:18:59,241 --> 00:18:59,641
Yeah.

160
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:02,680
Okay, well, that's one way to put it.

161
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:03,241
It is.

162
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,680
I mean, that's the puzzle.

163
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:11,721
It is use-dependent and yet independent because it's still a hammer when we're not using it.

164
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,761
Maybe.

165
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:15,080
I mean, that's an issue I don't want to go back to.

166
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,840
We're going to try to do this discussion without talking about the ready-to-hand and the present-at-hand ways of being, I guess.

167
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,961
But that complicates things because the ready-to-hand ways of being certainly are relative to us.

168
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,920
That is, it can't be ready-to-hand, except not even if it's just potential, it can't be ready-to-hand.

169
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:43,080
Strictly speaking, it can't be fully ready-to-hand unless somebody's actually hammering with it.

170
00:19:43,080 --> 00:20:00,200
Whereas the hammer, when it's present-at-hand, which is just lying around, but still sort of counts as a hammer in the workshop, that doesn't depend on us actually using it, but it's got this potential.

171
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:02,280
I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that.

172
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,160
I don't think that's going to help us out of this big problem.

173
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:08,040
So, let's go on with it and see what we get.

174
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,040
So now, where does nature fit in?

175
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,721
We're talking about hammers.

176
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:25,680
I don't want to talk about electrons yet, but nature is very interesting and important in this.

177
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:35,440
Heidegger, it is clear that nature depends on us even less than hammers depend on us.

178
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:42,960
Because, I mean, hammers in some ways depend on our practices and in some ways don't.

179
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:47,441
Nature maybe in no way depends on our practices.

180
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,481
The dogs and the trees and the oceans and the electrons all seem to get along.

181
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:09,440
We understand them as present at hand, and we understand that as the decontextualized way of being that takes them out of the referential totality.

182
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:12,241
So, and now we're looking at number two here.

183
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:15,920
Number two is about nature.

184
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:35,440
It's really over nature that the whole struggle, the struggle between whether you believe that nature exists in itself independent of us and our practices in some strong way, or whether nature is relative to the way we define it and encounter it.

185
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,641
So let's look at nature.

186
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:51,721
Number two, nature has to be made present and accessible in its perceptual being and regularity in such a way that all of those moments, all of that means something like features or something, moments is a funny word for there.

187
00:21:52,040 --> 00:22:03,640
Let's say, all of its all of the features are excluded which, through conditioning, our access to the observation of nature interfere with it.

188
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:19,640
That's a complicated way of saying you want to describe nature in such a way as to exclude whatever it is that you bring to the encounter with nature, which would keep you from understanding nature as it just plain was in itself.

189
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:25,320
And he thinks, he says going on, this tendency first, this tendency, what?

190
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:37,800
To try to see nature, or actually to think one is seeing nature, independent of whatever you bring to it, when you look at it, you see it as it is in itself.

191
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:45,721
This tendency first developed in such a way that rather than erecting a nexus of particular laws, it secured fundamental concepts.

192
00:22:45,721 --> 00:22:48,440
This happened in Greek philosophy.

193
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm going to interpret that as saying, I don't know exactly what Heidegger has in mind, but let's suppose he has in mind.

194
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:57,721
Aristotle comes along.

195
00:22:57,721 --> 00:22:59,400
He's a great naturalist.

196
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:02,440
He describes all sorts of plants and animals.

197
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:09,721
And he describes physics and the way the world is, and he describes how things behave in the world and so forth.

198
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:33,080
And he does it all, presumably thinking, I mean without maybe saying to himself, but that the idea would be describe it, leaving out any Aristotle relative aspects and just describe the the falling objects and the trees and the animals and everything as they are in in their natural state.

199
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:40,641
And well, I put it that way, because that might well be what Aristotle thought he was doing, but that's not what we think he was doing.

200
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,241
Maybe that's why you have your end of it.

201
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,120
If not, tell me why.

202
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:52,161
I mean, I didn't just remember that Sega followed even when Aristotle was doing all his great research in the animal work, he talked about the form of his animals.

203
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,640
Very anthropocentered sort of notion, Mike.

204
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:58,001
Why are horse table to be written if they're made to be written?

205
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,360
I see.

206
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,721
Interesting.

207
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:02,481
Maybe.

208
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:05,200
I was going to give a different example, but which is fine.

209
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:06,400
They fit together.

210
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:16,560
I don't know whether Aristotle thought he was describing nature as it was in itself, but he wasn't, according to our science, because he was talking about things seeking their natural place.

211
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,120
And so light things were going up and heavy things were going down.

212
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,560
And they were going down because they were pulled or they were that they had a tendency to go down if they were heavy.

213
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,961
And he has, I think, lots.

214
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:33,120
I mean, Adam would know better than me.

215
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:39,360
A lot of human relative stuff built into his view of nature, I suppose.

216
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,161
Or maybe not.

217
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,360
What do you think?

218
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm not sure that that's so much the issue as from what I understand the interpretation as the anti-sunder the character specifically putting the relationship with humanity.

219
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:55,761
And the answer is what?

220
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,961
It isn't, I suppose.

221
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,001
Is that right?

222
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,241
There isn't a whole lot of methodological discussion of impurity minds in Aristotle.

223
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,040
So how he views what's key is doing when things are down and all that biological seems to me not exactly clear.

224
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:22,081
But certainly if he wants to say that all things are tied together in spirit of the well and surprisingly speaking complete the energy of the end.

225
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:32,761
But he does want to tie, certainly wants to tie the interpretation of all tools back to the person who's evil in the end, the virus that can cause.

226
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:36,040
Yeah.

227
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,080
Okay.

228
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:38,280
Yeah, tools.

229
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:51,560
But now, the interesting thing is whether when he's talking about nature that hasn't been made for us and our purposes, how much he sort of still, from his sense of the world, brings in.

230
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,080
I'm going to make up a caricature because all I really need is that.

231
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:09,161
I mean, let's suppose he thinks that things have a tendency to go down and seek their natural place, and other things have a tendency to go up because their natural place is up in the sky and beyond the moon and so forth.

232
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:20,600
I mean, if he had that sort of view, it would show that he had not yet totally deworlded nature.

233
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,400
He'd done something like de-situated it.

234
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:45,241
Because I'm sure he already thought that hammers, if they had hammers, and they must have had things like that, that he must have thought that you could de-situate them, that is, not treat them as for hammering and not treat them as, say, too heavy, but just treat them as a shank of wood with a metal blob on the end.

235
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:53,080
That would get you a certain distance in your belief that now you were just describing nature.

236
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,360
But he certainly hasn't left everything out.

237
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:03,241
And what exactly he hasn't left out would be a great subject for study, and I'm sure people have been worrying about it for years.

238
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:09,200
But Heidegger goes on to say that modern physics makes a further step.

239
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:11,920
That's number three on your handout.

240
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:17,280
Modern physics led to the discovery of laws of motion, defining them in a way that was free.

241
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:25,200
Now, notice this is the crucial thing: free of any reference to the contingencies of its access, measurement, and defining of them.

242
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,040
Sort of want to underline that.

243
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,160
I mean, that's what I think Aristotle wasn't free of yet.

244
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:48,560
Galileo comes in, and Galileo really thinks and maybe does describe the motion of objects independent of up and down, independent of near and far, and so forth.

245
00:27:48,560 --> 00:28:08,241
Anything that's relative to us, maybe, is, or at least let us suppose, or at least Heidegger seems to be supposing, that you can get rid of any reference to whatever it is that we bring that gives us access to that.

246
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:16,560
So that's like saying, well, electrons are radically different than baseballs, because, well, never mind, that's a funny way to put it, isn't it?

247
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,200
I haven't thought of it.

248
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:20,481
It's like saying, never mind electrons and baseballs.

249
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:27,121
There's something that they both have in common, which is radically independent of us, and that is they obey the laws of motion.

250
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:39,440
They have inertia, and so they have mass, and they obey the laws of that describes.

251
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:43,360
And those laws are described in a way that's independent of us.

252
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,840
That's what Heidegger thinks we've got in modern physics.

253
00:28:47,840 --> 00:29:04,840
And then, just in case, you don't have to really read this, that he wants to sort of hedge people going around saying, and they still are, oh, but look, the theory of relativity finally shows that speed and location and all that is relative to an observer.

254
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:12,840
And Heidegger wants to say, yes, but we have absolute knowledge of even the kind of relativity.

255
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,241
He says the theory of relativity took seriously the idea of an absolute knowledge of nature.

256
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:20,441
It's not a theory about the relative validity of physical laws.

257
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:30,040
It inquires into those conditions of definition and measurement that make it possible for nature to be grasped purely in terms of itself and its laws of motion to be understood.

258
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,001
Those are strong, strong claims.

259
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:36,761
And very robust realist claims.

260
00:29:36,761 --> 00:29:54,361
He's trying, he seems to be saying that insofar that nature, particularly as studied by modern physics, has whatever structure and character it has completely independent of how we come across it, measure it, define it, and all the things he lists there.

261
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,481
Those are all, this is going to be a refrain that comes up again and again, so you might as well get used to it.

262
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:01,400
Those are all contingent.

263
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:07,160
That is, they are accidents of the way we access the laws of motion.

264
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:18,200
But what is essential and not contingent is what we find out by our theories about the law of motion.

265
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:25,401
And if you're going to be a robust realist, you have to make all of our access practices contingent.

266
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:27,241
That is, accidental.

267
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:31,080
They in no way define what it is you're getting access to.

268
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:41,681
Whereas clearly, our access practices to baseballs and such things are not totally independent of what we gain access to.

269
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,040
They're part of defining.

270
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,001
They are constitutive.

271
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:57,360
It's constitutive of baseballs to have certain shape and structure defined by the rules and to behave in certain ways that they have, that if they floated up into the air when you hit them, they wouldn't do as baseballs and so forth.

272
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:16,080
We define what the essence of a hammer or a baseball is, but it seems Heidegger's saying when you get to modern physics, we don't define anything about what the entity is except we let the entity tell us what it is.

273
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,200
Our defining is contingent.

274
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:21,761
That's very strong and interesting.

275
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:22,800
So now where are we?

276
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,920
Let me see.

277
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:28,161
So yeah, we got to modern physics.

278
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:28,961
Okay.

279
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:36,400
And that would be the robust reading of those two sentences.

280
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:46,881
That would make sense of the idea, well, but we better spell it out, that being depended on us, but that the beings don't.

281
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,001
How would that fit, say, Galileo?

282
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:57,840
Well, this is very tricky and obscure now, and I'm sure you're all going to call me on it, and I don't know what to say.

283
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,721
But I'll say it now, and I'll get in trouble later.

284
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:16,640
It looks like what he's saying is that, of course, the intelligibility of electrons and the laws of motion and all that depends on us when he said, because being depends on us.

285
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:21,440
And being, remember, is that on the basis of which beings are understood.

286
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:35,560
And that means sort of the background intelligibility that gives us access to electrons and enables us to make sense of them as things in nature.

287
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:43,721
That depends on us, even though all the particulars of it, I mean, that's the tricky part.

288
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:51,721
Even though we've got the measurement, the defining, and all that depends on the electrons.

289
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,080
What's up to them?

290
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,680
What spin, charge, weight, and so forth they've got.

291
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:03,001
Now, that you're looking puzzled.

292
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,001
I think that's your right to be puzzled.

293
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,040
I think, I'll tell you the most puzzling version of it, as long as you're already puzzled.

294
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:24,921
I mean, the way you make sense of things in nature, according to modern physics, is that you understand them as present at hand.

295
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,640
And what is it to understand them as present at hand?

296
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,321
Well, that's tricky.

297
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:34,600
You understand them as independent of our practices.

298
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:48,681
That's all right, except then you get this head-splitting fact that that's one of our practices, namely coming across entities and defining them independent of our practices.

299
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:57,240
So that's, and how the, how, and if you spin it one way, you say, aha, that's robust realism.

300
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,281
We have practices for encountering entities as they are independent of our practices.

301
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:06,121
That's how we make them intelligible as present at hand.

302
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,160
Or, but if you're an anti-realist, you say, yes, look at that.

303
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,080
We have these amazing practices.

304
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:18,961
We can come across these things and treat them and think about them as they are in themselves.

305
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,761
That's what we do.

306
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,240
And therefore, even being present at hand is somehow relative to our practices.

307
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,601
That's the head-splitting thing.

308
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:39,441
And I think Heidegger's going to claim, if I understand him right, that for nature, no, no, no.

309
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:41,760
If I even say this, it's going to be confusing.

310
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
I'm confused.

311
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,280
I'm not confused.

312
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:47,120
I think it's intrinsically confusing.

313
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,240
Let me think.

314
00:34:51,680 --> 00:35:01,761
But Heidegger's got to say something like: the practices for making sense of things independent of our practices are themselves contingent.

315
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:09,121
That is, it doesn't matter to the electron that we've got practices for treating things as present at hand.

316
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:21,840
It's finally what we have is ways of encountering things as, well, you see, go around in circles, as independent of those ways of encountering things.

317
00:35:21,841 --> 00:35:22,960
I can't do any better.

318
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:24,721
You just have to keep this in mind.

319
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:37,761
All the time, the question is going to be: when you say that the being of these entities depends on us, these entities meaning like electrons, how are you hearing that?

320
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:45,840
You've got to hear it as that means that none of our access practices make any difference to electrons.

321
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:47,441
They're all contingent.

322
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:59,001
And it means somehow our practices for making them intelligible doesn't even finally get a grip on them.

323
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,801
Now, hold on on that, because that's where things get really interesting and weird.

324
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:11,241
But I want to keep letting you have a chance to talk, because I think this is all interesting and weird and hard.

325
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,280
And are you getting it?

326
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:13,481
Is it okay so far?

327
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,481
You're not lost, I hope.

328
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:15,961
Okay.

329
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,681
When you get lost, yeah.

330
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,521
Okay, now let's see where we are.

331
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:28,920
Heidegger needs to show, let's see, so what's the ontological question?

332
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:35,241
There's a new puzzle, the thing to keep clear about, which everybody falls into, and I do too sometimes.

333
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,040
We're asking an ontological question.

334
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:55,800
That is, we're not asking the epistemological question, how would Aristotle know, or Galileo know, whether they were describing the electrons as they were in themselves, utterly independent of the background that they were bringing, before having they were bringing.

335
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,961
Obviously, Galileo, sorry, Aristotle didn't know.

336
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:09,801
And maybe Galileo didn't know either, because maybe something in his story was still human muggled in.

337
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:10,360
I don't know.

338
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,040
He certainly thought he was outside.

339
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:18,040
In his dialogues on two world systems, he's the first to try to describe everything he's talking about.

340
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:24,840
He says constantly, sort of as if you were standing outside the world and outside of everything when you're describing it.

341
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:27,400
He really thought he had deworlded.

342
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,400
And so the epistemological question might be: well, had he really deworlded?

343
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:35,160
Aristotle hadn't, and how will we ever know if we get everything de-worlded?

344
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,080
That's not the right question.

345
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,881
If you ask that question, the answer is we won't ever know.

346
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,881
But that's not the point.

347
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:46,560
The point is ontological, not epistemological.

348
00:37:46,560 --> 00:38:02,560
Can we make sense of the way we encounter things, of things in themselves, whose properties and whose nature is totally independent of our encountering things?

349
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:11,680
Maybe someday, if we can make sense of it, then we can say, well, maybe someday we'll actually ever do it, or maybe we already did it with Galileo or with Newton.

350
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
We'll never know for sure.

351
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,800
Maybe Einstein finally did it.

352
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:16,080
That's not interesting.

353
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:31,361
The interesting thing is: does it even make sense if you think of us as always having a forehaving, of always having to bring a whole procedure for disclosing and opening up a space in which we encounter anything?

354
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:44,321
Can we make sense of us, that kind of being that we are, encountering beings that have absolutely no reference to us, but are independent of us in themselves and so forth?

355
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:46,320
Now, I think we can.

356
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:48,321
I think Heidegger thinks we can.

357
00:38:48,321 --> 00:38:54,560
I think that's what he thinks we find in nature, or modern science has found in nature.

358
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,881
But now we still have a long way to go.

359
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,720
So let me go on.

360
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,241
Keep in mind where we are.

361
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,040
Okay, let me see now.

362
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:22,241
So we want to know whether we can make sense of things in nature, that is, the things in the universe, that is, things like electrons, as in no way dependent upon us and our practices, even in our practices for opening up a world in which things can be encountered.

363
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:44,921
So, and Heidegger wants to agree with the deflationary realist that all modes of being, of making sense of things, of encountering things, depend on us, but he still wants to say, aha, yeah, but things could be, it makes sense to think that things might be, totally, absolutely independent of us.

364
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:51,721
Then we would be encountering something as purely present at hand, I think you could say.

365
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,880
Although, unfortunately, he doesn't say that.

366
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:01,560
But I would like to say, you'd be encountering things as purely present at hand, you would be doing pure discovering.

367
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:15,320
I mean, it's unfortunate for this difficult discussion that Heidegger doesn't use the terms pure present at hand and pure discovering in the robust realist way I just used them when he's talking about it.

368
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:17,720
You'll see, I just got that shock two days ago.

369
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:25,321
For the first time, I opened my eyes and read the text and discovered it isn't quite using the terms the way I wanted him to use them.

370
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:27,481
But that's not the crucial thing.

371
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:31,641
The crucial thing is something like: can we genuinely de-world?

372
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:45,641
Another way to put it, genuinely get out of the hermeneutic circle, genuinely get described things in which our forehaving makes no constitutive, plays no constitutive role, or can't we?

373
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,841
And we have to find out more.

374
00:40:49,801 --> 00:41:03,961
It looks like we can't, because meaning, encountering, the clearing, the world, and being itself, intelligibility, all depend on diesel.

375
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:16,881
When you say that, you don't know what's left when you say, but beings don't, except some kind of minimal stuff that, of course, how many dollars you got is enough to you just by thinking about it.

376
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:23,281
But it you it doesn't look like you could have a strong understanding of the that beings don't.

377
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:39,201
A strong, robust understanding of beings don't would mean, you know, electrons, like I keep repeating, have their charge, have their spin, have their weight, and they have it completely whether we ever existed or not, whether anybody ever discovered electrons or not.

378
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,401
How can we get that strong conclusion?

379
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,601
It all depends on our sense of access to them.

380
00:41:52,881 --> 00:42:03,441
That is, at the bottom of 255, he says, only if the understanding of being is, do entities and entities become do entities as entities become accessible.

381
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:10,881
If you hear that, you can hear that is in a deflationary realist, that is, anti-realist really, way.

382
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:21,841
You can say that, well, just as I thought, if you're one of them, so the understanding of being makes the entities accessible.

383
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:24,161
But you can hear it another way.

384
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,281
Yeah, fine.

385
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:30,001
Those are we have to have access practices to get to electrons.

386
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:39,521
And it's true that our own understanding of being has to be in place and a whole lot of other practices too before electrons could become accessible.

387
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:46,401
But they're not constituted, it's the same point again, by what all the stuff we have to do to make them accessible.

388
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:49,121
They've got whatever structure they've got.

389
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:56,441
And it's really the introduction of this notion of accessible, which is really, I think, an important move in Heidegger.

390
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:07,961
The constitutive people think that somehow our access practices, in some way, shape, or color, or something, the things we have access to.

391
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:20,200
And Heidegger's keeping at least an open mind about whether we couldn't have access to something which, whereby the access made absolutely no difference to what we were having access to.

392
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,521
That would be, again, robust realism.

393
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:30,121
That would be the strong sense in which being depends on us, that's our access practices, and beings don't.

394
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,881
That's the electrons.

395
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:37,881
That would be, that's one way of reading those wonderfully puzzling sentences.

396
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,840
So, and we're getting to the interesting crunch now.

397
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:43,001
This gets very funny in a moment.

398
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:45,160
So, bear with it.

399
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:46,920
Oh, maybe not quite yet.

400
00:43:46,921 --> 00:44:07,881
On 254, Heidegger gets to his most seemingly making everything dependent on us at the bottom of 254, about five lines into that last section on reality and care.

401
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:11,961
Being in the sense of pure present at hand, he's going to talk about it.

402
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:15,080
Not all presence at hand is present at hand of things.

403
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,441
Now comes the physics part.

404
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:20,841
The nature by which we are surrounded is, of course, an entity within the world.

405
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,361
Don't get fooled by that.

406
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:24,921
Electrons get flying around in the world.

407
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,960
It's sort of nice to talk about electrons because they really are equipment in the world.

408
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:37,720
Electrons can be used to fire out of electron guns onto cathode ray tubes and make pictures and oscilloscopes.

409
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:55,841
So it isn't that you can't sort of capture an electron and make it into a piece of equipment, but the point is whether when you're not capturing it and it's running around in some other galaxy, it's whether the fact that we can make it into equipment makes any difference.

410
00:44:55,841 --> 00:44:57,681
The answer is I think it shouldn't.

411
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,121
So let's so where are we?

412
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:08,641
Nature by which we are surrounded is of course an entity within the world.

413
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,201
Dogs, trees, electrons, all that stuff are in the world.

414
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,841
But the kind of being which it shows, nature, belongs neither to the ready-to-hand nor to the present at hand as things of nature.

415
00:45:21,841 --> 00:45:24,401
So now that's interesting.

416
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:35,601
No matter how this being of nature may be interpreted, all the modes of being of entities within the world are founded ontologically upon the worldhood of the world and accordingly upon the phenomenon of being in the world.

417
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,400
Wow.

418
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:58,641
So on the one hand, he's saying, well, the things of nature are not going to be ready or intelligible as ready to hand nor even as present at hand, but whatever they are, all the modes of being of entities within the world are founded upon the worldhood of the world.

419
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,720
Yes, but of course the trick there is that's not a strong anti-realist claim.

420
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:18,481
That says when electrons are in the world, when people are using them to shoot at something or other, then of course they've got all the characteristics of being in the world.

421
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:24,601
But the things of nature, when they're just in nature, don't, I think.

422
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:29,481
But we still, there's one more move you have to pay attention to.

423
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:39,641
And this is the one where, if you thought the puzzle of how we have practices to deal with things such as they are independent of our practices is puzzling.

424
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,401
Here's a really, this one is the one I don't really understand at all.

425
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:48,281
Suppose you say, well, we make electrons intelligible.

426
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:55,001
We treat them as present at hand when they're out there in the universe.

427
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:57,080
That's our way of being.

428
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,961
That's why their being depends upon us.

429
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:03,161
We're the ones who see them as present at hand.

430
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:09,481
And in general, we make them intelligible as having a certain structure, a certain spin, and so forth.

431
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:30,601
But as soon as we do all that, then we're in trouble, because then it looks like we can't not only epistemologically ever be sure that we haven't smuggled in our own human forehaving, but we're ontologically not in any position to say that we haven't.

432
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,880
That's the important thing.

433
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:35,080
We're not in an ontological position.

434
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:46,040
If the intelligibility of everything depends on us, then we don't, it's hard to see how we can say, aha, but they don't depend on us at all.

435
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:52,761
They are absolutely independent of us, whether we were ever around or not.

436
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:59,560
So it looks like what he's got to say is what science deals with isn't even intelligible.

437
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:02,921
That's how independent of us it is.

438
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,201
But that's an outrageous thing to have to say.

439
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,721
But that's what he does say.

440
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,680
I mean, he really bites the bullet.

441
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:14,720
That's the main reason I handed out the handout: you've got to see it to believe it.

442
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,521
The most peculiar thought.

443
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:19,760
But I forgot to remember where it is.

444
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:26,480
I want you to see it first as you have it in front of you in being in time, and then because it's condensed to one sentence.

445
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:28,641
Help, I've lost it again.

446
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,720
Where it's in the understanding chapter, so I have to find the understanding.

447
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:36,560
It's on the left-hand side of the page at the bottom.

448
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:39,681
Here it is, on 194.

449
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:48,641
Write that in there after the thing I'm about to read, which is number four in your handout.

450
00:48:48,640 --> 00:49:06,241
Because that's typical, it's fun anyway, typical of Heidegger saying something at great length, or some length, in a lecture, and then saying it in a, which is already incomprehensible, and then saying it in a completely incomprehensible, condensed way in being in time.

451
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,801
So here we are at the bottom of being in time.

452
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:11,920
I've got to explain something to explain this.

453
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:23,121
What Heidegger's assuming here is something that everybody believed in those days, and I still believe, that there's a basic difference between understanding and explaining.

454
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:32,481
That goes to a philosopher, historian named Giltai, but you don't have to know that.

455
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:39,601
But there is understanding.

456
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,601
Here, Dan, that's the same kind of word, it's understanding.

457
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,401
And there is explaining.

458
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:54,521
Claire.

459
00:49:56,361 --> 00:50:02,921
And now, understanding is what you do in the human sciences, Dilkai said.

460
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:17,080
And in the everyday world, you put things in a bunch of in a context which makes them intelligible to us in terms of our purposes, our perception, our skill.

461
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,601
We understand each other.

462
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,961
We understand the economy and money.

463
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,241
And we understand the activity of science.

464
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:35,320
If you say the physical world was shocked at the discovery of a fifth force, you understand what that means because that's about the practices of the physicist.

465
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,481
But the universe, you are explaining.

466
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:44,840
I mean, Gilkai didn't have this distinction, world and universe.

467
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,280
Heidegger barely has it.

468
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:48,761
He says it once in Basic Problems.

469
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,480
I think it's very helpful to have a universe here.

470
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,080
The universe isn't shocked by the discovery of a fifth force.

471
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,280
There just is a fifth force, it looks like.

472
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:01,881
And if there is, that's all right.

473
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:03,881
That's how it is.

474
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,961
We have theories to explain what's going on in the universe.

475
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:13,321
And they don't, we don't understand them.

476
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,000
We don't understand what's going on.

477
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:19,080
Not that we don't understand it because we just haven't found out enough about the fifth force.

478
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:31,881
Nothing you could find out about the fifth force or the universe counts as understanding in this distinction, because understanding ills always relates to us and our purposes and our moods and our for the sake of witches.

479
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:36,760
And it only counts as explaining if it doesn't relate to us.

480
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,880
This is where you do, it starts with the laws of motion in Galileo.

481
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:48,240
He's going to explain why things fall, all things fall at the same rate, for instance.

482
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:53,040
He's going to explain it, but he's not going to understand it in the sense that it's not going to relate to us.

483
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,560
Now, all that is in the background.

484
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:06,401
When Heidegger says, in one sense, after the italics, the assimilation of understanding and interpretation to an indefinite ideal of knowledge is not the issue here.

485
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:11,760
Now, this ideal of knowledge is explaining.

486
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,681
Such an ideal is itself only a subspecies of understanding.

487
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,680
A subspecies, so he's going to call it, he has a broader notion of understanding than I was giving you.

488
00:52:22,481 --> 00:52:33,361
But what's important is, I'll explain in a minute, a subspecies which is strayed into the legitimate task of grasping the president at hand in its essential unintelligibility.

489
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:35,040
That's what I want you to see.

490
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:52,160
He's not going to use understanding and explaining here, but what he's really saying is there is understanding and there is something else, which he says is a kind of understanding, but I don't like that, and Diltai wouldn't like it either, I don't think.

491
00:52:52,160 --> 00:53:01,761
There is something other than understanding, which has, and I love this weird phrase, stayed in straight into the legitimate task.

492
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,800
What does that mean?

493
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:26,920
It means that, amazingly enough, Galileo stumbled on a way of dealing with motion that actually seems to be outside of the world, deworlded, independent of his four Hava, doesn't talk about anything seeking its natural place, doesn't talk about what keeps things moving, he just says they just keep moving because inertia is one of the features of it.

494
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:40,360
It's an incident that there is anything worth talking about that is totally independent, that may well be, you have to keep saying, because you get rid of the epistemological claim.

495
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:53,321
It may well be that Galileo has found something, and Newton further, and Einstein further, which is independent of any reference to any way we make any sense of anything.

496
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:56,281
That's what it would have to be.

497
00:53:56,281 --> 00:54:02,121
And then it would, and he's straight into it because who would have thought there would be such a thing?

498
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:07,641
And it's legitimate in that, yes, it looks like there really is such a thing as far as we can tell.

499
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:17,480
There really is a way of describing things that treats them in a way that makes them not even, and now comes the punchline, intelligible to us.

500
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:30,521
Because remember, we've got to get, we want to get something so independent of us that it isn't in no way influenced by our, what we can understand, what we're going to describe now.

501
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,040
That's pretty weird.

502
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:42,521
But now, having read that weird sentence, look at the place where he spells it out completely, or a lot more completely, and in a way bizarrely.

503
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:54,040
At the bottom of the number four, here's the long version, which I hope is in, yeah, it's in the history of concept of time.

504
00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:02,201
So every explanation, when we seek of an explanation of nature, is distinguished by its involvement in the incomprehensible.

505
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,921
See, the opposite of the intelligible.

506
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:10,241
In some funny sense, electrons are incomprehensible.

507
00:55:10,961 --> 00:55:13,040
At least, it's this sense.

508
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,441
They don't fit into our referential totality.

509
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:17,680
They don't connect up with our for the sake of which.

510
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:23,121
There's no reason why there should be electrons the way Aristotle thought there was a reason why there should be horses.

511
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,040
They are, in that sense, at least incomprehensible.

512
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:30,880
But I think that I have to jump ahead.

513
00:55:30,881 --> 00:55:37,121
I think Heidegger would love quantum physics, where things are getting more and more incomprehensible all the time.

514
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:54,001
And that's, and far from being an objection, that's more and more evidence, if you had an epistemological concern, that we may well be describing them in a way that makes no reference to our way of making things intelligible.

515
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:56,240
That's very upsetting about quantum physics.

516
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,440
I don't even like it, but that's the way it goes.

517
00:55:59,441 --> 00:56:00,960
So let's read it again now.

518
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:04,640
Science deals with the incomprehensible.

519
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,601
Second sentence.

520
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:17,680
It can be flatly stated that explanation, that's this one, is the expository interpretation of the incomprehensible.

521
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:23,441
Not so that this exposition would let us comprehend the incomprehensible.

522
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:26,800
That would be like saying, well, it's an electron, it's ready to hand.

523
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:30,560
Somehow that already is not what's important.

524
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:35,280
What's important is there is an X, and it has something or other.

525
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:42,880
We can call it a charge and a mass and a spin, but those are all formal relations of it, that we don't really understand them.

526
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:45,120
We can't picture them.

527
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,721
We can't relate to them.

528
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,521
For it remains incomprehensible in principle.

529
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:52,480
Nature does.

530
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:56,201
That is, we can't bring it in relation to our way of understanding things.

531
00:56:56,521 --> 00:56:57,880
And how does it go on?

532
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:06,601
Nature is, turn the page, is what is in principle explainable and to be explained because it is in principle incomprehensible.

533
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,000
It is the incomprehensible, pure, and simple.

534
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:18,121
And it is the incomprehensible because it is the unworlded world insofar as we take nature in this extreme sense of the entity as it's discovered in physics.

535
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,881
So that's the robust realism claim.

536
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:33,240
I mean, if you can make sense of that, which I don't know whether I can or not, I just don't know what it is to say that electrons are incomprehensible already, even at the time of Bohr, let alone.

537
00:57:33,321 --> 00:57:43,481
I mean, I'm beginning, it can understand more and more what it's like to be incomprehensible when something isn't a particle and it isn't a wave and it does all kinds of weird things like electrons.

538
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:50,441
Now, it turns out they do, but it's still incomprehensible in principle.

539
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:57,241
That is, there is no way of connecting it up to our practices for making sense of things.

540
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:03,800
I don't know what that means, but I know why Heidegger's trying what Heidegger's trying to say, I think.

541
00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:06,360
I mean, physics deworlds.

542
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:17,401
And if physics really thoroughly deworlds, it gets rid of all fourhaving, it gets rid of all of our practices for making things intelligible.

543
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,400
Those are access practices.

544
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:20,441
It doesn't get rid of them.

545
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:38,801
I mean, it doesn't throw out, you don't have to throw out your spectrograph and your electron microscope, but it it leaves out of the d of the description of the theory anything that has to do with the way we make sense of the kind of things that we encounter in the world.

546
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:41,200
And so he, as I say, he bites the bullet.

547
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:45,280
He wants to say that physics actually deworlds.

548
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:51,760
Or, I think you always ought to be qualifying it, something like it looks like physics actually de-worlds.

549
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,480
It may well be that physics actually deworlds.

550
00:58:54,481 --> 00:59:01,600
It makes sense, that's the tricky part, to think of a physics as an activity that deworlds.

551
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,121
That's robust realism, I presume.

552
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,720
Yeah, Tyler, say something.

553
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,560
People are looking zombified, and understandably so.

554
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,680
I think maybe it is not in possession.

555
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,400
It's not really why we get rid of the forehaving structure.

556
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:26,560
It's not because forehand structure becomes more accurate, even so.

557
00:59:34,961 --> 00:59:36,961
That's what I think, yes.

558
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:41,281
491, can't keep talking about the order, you know.

559
00:59:42,881 --> 00:59:43,921
Well, let's look at it.

560
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:44,560
Let's look at it.

561
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:45,441
Let's see.

562
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:53,121
The issue is whether, before we read it, we have to set up what we're looking for.

563
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,921
I mean, surely the forest structure is there in our access practices.

564
00:59:57,921 --> 01:00:10,481
The question is whether the forest structure is constitutive in any way of what we get access to, or whether our access practices are completely contingent.

565
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:15,440
That is, we've got that access structure, and without it, we wouldn't be able to get to electrons.

566
01:00:15,441 --> 01:00:19,760
But the force structure plays no role in what it is to be an electron.

567
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,200
That would be the version that I claim he holds.

568
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:24,760
So let's look at 191.

569
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,040
I think it's great that we've got a test case.

570
01:00:29,881 --> 01:00:39,400
The alternative, just let me say, it would seem to be that I think Tyler's introduced a new possibility.

571
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:53,321
It sounds like, well, the access practices are accidentally exactly give us the structure that's really there.

572
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:56,121
That would be sort of a god-like picture.

573
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,120
I mean, I forget whether it's Einstein or Galileo.

574
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:09,641
I think maybe, let's suppose it's Einstein who said something like, well, what if the universe were all complicated like that?

575
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:16,521
And then Einstein or Galileo, whoever it was, said, well, then God would give us the kind of mind that was able to understand something complicated like that.

576
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:40,200
And that would be, that's what's really sort of, if you think that the access practices, even though they don't in any way constitute what you're dealing with, actually capture the structure of what you're dealing with, rather than thinking, oh, well, no, that's it.

577
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,440
If you think that, it's very mysterious.

578
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:58,040
You see, it's mysterious because you would think, you wouldn't think that the access practices that you've got would set you up, unless you're the last of the religious scientists, I think, like Einstein.

579
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:19,360
You wouldn't think that somehow God had made your mind so that your access practices, though completely contingent, and in no way constitutive of the structure of the universe, were exactly getting at the structure of the universe, and therefore it looks like the world ought to be intelligible.

580
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,720
I mean, that's what Einstein thought.

581
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:31,761
He thought all of quantum theory, he still, he thought till he died, that all quantum theory must be wrong because it's not intelligible, even to his mind, and his mind was pretty good.

582
01:02:32,001 --> 01:02:49,601
That is, why would we have access practices to which give us the structure of a reality completely independent of us?

583
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:58,880
It's intell I mean, well, yeah, I mean, that's the, I like what Tyler's saying.

584
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:26,080
I mean, the other, the only alternative to the view that I'm talking about, and I think Heidegger's holding, namely that what we get at is unintelligible, finally, and that we've got a sort of theories which less and less make any sense to us, but they still enable us to predict things.

585
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,001
And that's one possibility.

586
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:42,080
And the other possibility is, isn't it amazing the universe and our mind are in such rapport that the more we understand about electrons and so forth or forces, the more it fits with just what we'd expect it to be.

587
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,121
Something like that.

588
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,521
So, where's the let's let's before you talk?

589
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:48,881
Where's the passage I should be reading to try to understand this?

590
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:55,401
Okay, that would be because this is really interesting to look at, and it is definitely about the forehaving.

591
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,840
How much do we have to read?

592
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,640
Wait, I've got to find it yet.

593
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:09,321
In this middle, big, middle, middle paragraph.

594
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:15,961
Okay, got it.

595
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:21,640
Anything understood, that let me read it tonight out loud.

596
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:30,121
Anything understood, which is held in our forehaving and towards which we set our sights four-sidedly, becomes conceptualizable through interpretation.

597
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,560
Notice, anything.

598
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:44,121
In such an interpretation, the way in which the entity we interpret is to be conceived, can be drawn from the entity itself, or the interpretation can force the entity into concepts into which it is opposed in its manner of being.

599
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:48,441
In either case, the interpretation has already decided for a definite way of conceiving.

600
01:04:48,441 --> 01:04:50,601
That's the four conception.

601
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:58,040
Either with finality or with reservations, it is grounded in something we grasp in advance in a foreconception.

602
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:05,320
Well, now, I don't know yet what I mean, but I would say, yes, that's about interpretation.

603
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:06,521
That's about understanding.

604
01:05:06,521 --> 01:05:13,080
That's about how we deal with anything in the world, that is, with anything that's intelligible to us.

605
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:22,521
I don't think that's about the deworlded, pure discovery that he gets to when he talks about science.

606
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:41,761
Yes, yes, because in itself is very tricky, and I should have warned you about that, all of you.

607
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:52,160
I I used to think that when Heidegger said in itself, he had always i in mind a strong understanding of in itself, which goes with robust realism and what I've been saying.

608
01:05:52,160 --> 01:06:01,761
Electrons have the structure and charge they do in themselves, meaning without any reference to any of our ways of making sense of them or of getting at them.

609
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:09,761
But he also talks about how hammering deals with, in effect, nails in themselves.

610
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:25,921
And because there's always this ambiguity about the in itself, whether it just means as an entity sort of which you can distinguish from the other entities, or whether it means an entity that bears no relation to anything including us.

611
01:06:25,921 --> 01:06:31,440
And this is going to be, as I read it, this is not, here's the simplest way to put it.

612
01:06:31,441 --> 01:06:33,121
This is not about theory.

613
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,681
This is about something else than theory.

614
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:44,001
This is how we understand, importantly, something like, let's say, I don't know, the Chinese economy.

615
01:06:44,001 --> 01:07:06,001
Now, there, if you have the wrong sort of preconceptions that somehow free enterprise is what everybody is really doing and everybody's out satisfying their desires, it might be, and I don't know if there's a good example, probably in my story, that it should be, try to understand the Japanese economy as if everybody had individual desires and was out to satisfy them.

616
01:07:06,001 --> 01:07:07,521
That was the free market.

617
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:09,521
That was what made the economy work.

618
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:20,560
You won't get very far if the story I was telling about how the Japanese are much more sort of census-oriented and not trying to satisfy each person their own desires.

619
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,880
Let's suppose that's how it is.

620
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:30,521
Then it looks like you bring the wrong forehaving to bear, you won't be able to understand what's going on.

621
01:07:30,521 --> 01:07:38,680
And if you bring the right forehaving to bear, namely that it's all social and holistic, you would have an understanding.

622
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,361
That's one thing this could mean.

623
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:49,080
That would be how to get the wrong forehaving in the world, and how if you're going to do social science, you better have the right forehaving.

624
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:55,481
And you better even have the right forehaving if you're trying to understand your neighbor who happens to always be pulling up your flowers or something.

625
01:07:55,481 --> 01:08:00,361
You're trying to get the right understanding of what might be upsetting him or something.

626
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:05,960
Then you could have a wrong view, or you could get, you know, get right about it.

627
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,200
So now, Eugene would like to say something.

628
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:13,000
Extra paradoxical because this thing is unintelligible.

629
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,241
Right.

630
01:08:13,321 --> 01:08:14,361
That's a really strong word.

631
01:08:14,361 --> 01:08:16,120
So something is really unintelligible.

632
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:18,760
We need a weaker word.

633
01:08:19,081 --> 01:08:25,161
But the great people weren't really that therapy doesn't worry about understanding familiarity.

634
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,560
But electrons are unfamiliar.

635
01:08:32,281 --> 01:08:38,121
But if you do math problems, they're unintelligible.

636
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:40,121
They may raise, but they're not really unintelligible.

637
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,401
Okay.

638
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,040
I mean, yeah, I mean, maybe we have to say that.

639
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:53,080
Heidegger certainly doesn't give us any help if he's trying to say that.

640
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:03,240
Okay, well, that's sort of what I think, too.

641
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:14,320
That is, he's saying you can't bring that what's incomprehensible and unintelligible can't be brought into relation to the referential totality and our purposes and stuff for sure.

642
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,760
That may be all it means.

643
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:28,800
If so, then it's not a strong move toward the claim of robust realism, but you don't need it as a strong move.

644
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:37,600
If you could claim, as he does, but you need an argument, which he doesn't have, that our access practices could be totally contingent.

645
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:54,560
I mean, one way you get there is, well, the way I got there by saying, well, that is, there must be whatever it is, if our access practices are totally contingent, then the thing must be whatever it is, independent of any of the ways we make sense of it.

646
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,521
And that might be all right, but now we're getting sort of close to Tyler.

647
01:09:57,521 --> 01:10:07,920
I mean, it's independent any way we make sense of it, and lo and behold, lucky for us, we strayed into a way of making sense of it that corresponds to its structure.

648
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,120
That would be less crazy.

649
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:12,640
And I think that's all right.

650
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,560
Heidegger never talks that way.

651
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,920
Now, I don't know why, but keep your eyes open.

652
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,680
See, why not say?

653
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:20,800
It's luck.

654
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,160
It's an accident.

655
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:24,160
Galileo strayed into it.

656
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:30,960
It's amazing that we've got so far with relativity and quantum physics.

657
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:35,521
String theory is even more weird with how many 13 or something degrees of freedom.

658
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:36,960
We can't think it at all.

659
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,361
But maybe it's the way things are.

660
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:45,760
But if it is the way things are, then we've got some kind of grasp on it.

661
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,361
That's what you're saying, and Tyler's saying.

662
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:50,320
And why don't I say that too?

663
01:10:50,640 --> 01:11:03,640
Why don't I just give up the unintelligibility ploy, which I told you was driving me crazy because I couldn't make any sense out of it, and just take him warning the contingency ploy.

664
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:14,840
That is, he wants to assert that it belongs to the being of nature, that our access to it is in no way constitutive of what it is.

665
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,040
That fits with what you said and Tyler said.

666
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:19,481
So let's say it that way.

667
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:30,680
We're still a robust realist, but we now don't have to claim that what we believe about, what our theories about X don't correspond to X.

668
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:36,120
They do correspond to X if we're lucky, and it works very well, and science needs to work very well.

669
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:37,401
That's all right.

670
01:11:37,401 --> 01:11:50,521
The important thing is that the theories don't now, and we believe, though we can't prove it, that our theories in no way impose a structure on what's there.

671
01:11:50,521 --> 01:11:52,441
See, that's the crucial thing.

672
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:58,441
The practices by which we make sense of it aren't what's making it the thing it is.

673
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:03,800
The way the practices that we make sense of baseballs make baseballs the way they are.

674
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,720
We've got to make that move.

675
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,240
But the move's already made.

676
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:11,080
That's where I said underline the stuff on page one.

677
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:21,160
We want to talk about physics getting the laws of motion free of any reference to the contingencies of access, measurement, and defining them.

678
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:26,600
We want to get them purely in terms of the laws of motion to be understood.

679
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,040
Okay, now you want to say something?

680
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,080
Yeah, that would be helpful.

681
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:49,521
Thinking of science instead of this is the universe.

682
01:12:49,521 --> 01:12:56,560
Instead of thinking of it as our efforts to create predictive systems, the only way we can, sort of being as we are.

683
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:05,040
And sort of thinking, I mean, there's this tendency to think of science as very, but exactly like the world is looking at these formulas and being like, this is how the universe works.

684
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:10,560
But if we thought of it differently, would that really cause any problems for Heidegger's phenomena?

685
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:12,080
Good question.

686
01:13:12,081 --> 01:13:14,080
No, I don't, I guess not.

687
01:13:14,081 --> 01:13:15,600
I mean, I have to think about it.

688
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,760
It would cause a problem for me just because I want to be a robust realist.

689
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,680
And it might cause a problem because I think he wants to be a robust realist.

690
01:13:24,161 --> 01:13:40,000
But you could say, well, science could get along fine if we were all deflationary realists or constructivists and said that the world we're discovering by way of science is in part structured by our own activity.

691
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:47,040
And but luckily for us, we can predict anyway and get things anyway.

692
01:13:47,041 --> 01:14:11,521
Yeah, I mean, you can all just get off this weird trip that I've been on for the whole lecture simply by not wanting, by wanting, by giving up the idea that there is pure deworlding, pure discovery, that there is a way the universe is independent of us, that electrons really do have a charge and a mass and a spin, period.

693
01:14:11,521 --> 01:14:17,600
And but I mean I just think that just feels wrong.

694
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,441
But I'm I'm of another generation.

695
01:14:19,441 --> 01:14:25,560
I have a feeling that n more and more people are going to feel that because Nietzsche thinks that it's all constructed.

696
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:30,281
And Nietzsche is usually sort of ahead of what people find believable.

697
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:31,321
Yeah.

698
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:45,640
Although we're pretty much certain being in mind.

699
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,441
Yeah, good.

700
01:14:48,441 --> 01:14:50,200
Yes, I think, I see what you're saying.

701
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:55,560
And I want to sort of go fast because I don't want to come back to realism and I've got only four minutes or something.

702
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:16,760
Yes, I think Heidegger thinks something like: look, if you do the phenomenology of nature and you find that what we think about nature is, that it's in itself, that it's independent of us, that our access to it in no way constitutes it and gives it a structure, and then he wants to sort of ask, well, how would you make sense of that?

703
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:32,600
And he's going to give you on 408 this story, which I don't have to go over luckily because time is running out, how you get from hammering, remember, he wants to tell you the way theoretical discovery happens.

704
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,800
He wants to give you an existential conception of science.

705
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:50,521
And then he tells it to you on 412, how you go from a hammer is transparently working to the hammer has weight, to the hammer has mass, and is subject to the laws of gravity.

706
01:15:50,521 --> 01:16:06,680
And it looks like he's telling you how theory, what he calls theoretical discovery, becomes more and more and more disconnected from the world, and that he believes that.

707
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,000
And now, I want to say, one more quick thing.

708
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:23,920
And so he would put together his derivation of theory as more and more deworlding with his intuition that our understanding of nature is completely deworlded and try to get you to believe that.

709
01:16:24,241 --> 01:16:29,120
What I want to say, and maybe you will, some of you too, well, what's the argument, Heidegger?

710
01:16:29,121 --> 01:16:37,680
How can we know anything about nature in which our access is contingent?

711
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:45,521
Well, the punch is that Heidegger talks about the essence of the things in nature.

712
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:47,441
Number five.

713
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,441
I'm going to run out of time, but give me another three minutes, maybe.

714
01:16:56,401 --> 01:16:57,840
But I'm not sure it's number five.

715
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,040
That is just what I needed.

716
01:16:59,041 --> 01:17:02,160
I've something about essence in here.

717
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,960
Oh, yeah, it is number five.

718
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:11,361
Interworldliness is accordingly not an extant property, that is present-at-hand property, a present-at-hand things.

719
01:17:11,521 --> 01:17:23,040
Present-at-hand things are the kind of things they are, even if they do not belong, become interworldly, even if world entry doesn't happen to them and there is no occasion for it at all.

720
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:36,240
Interworldliness does not belong to the essence of occurring things as such, but is only the transcendental condition in the primordial sense for the possibility of present-at-hand things being able to emerge as they are.

721
01:17:36,241 --> 01:17:53,521
Now, if there were such a thing as the essence of present-at-hand things, then we could, that's the missing argument he needs, because then we could discover the essential properties and they would be independent of all the contingent aspects that we use to get them.

722
01:17:53,960 --> 01:18:13,800
So, if an electric, for instance, one quick example, if gold has an atomic weight of 79, I think it is, and if that explains all the other causal properties of gold, then when you found the essence of gold, you found something that is independent of our access practices.

723
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,160
But you have to believe that there are two things.

724
01:18:17,161 --> 01:18:26,361
You have to believe, and Heidegger should have, because he believes in essences, and he believes in formal indication, in crippy language.

725
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:29,321
And how many do you know about rigid designation?

726
01:18:29,321 --> 01:18:30,521
It's the same thing.

727
01:18:30,521 --> 01:18:45,080
And if so, Heidegger had all he needed, a belief in essences, and a belief that we could designate something by just sort of pointing out at it and then working it over to find out finally what its essential structure was.

728
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:50,200
That would give him what he needs to support number five here.

729
01:18:50,201 --> 01:19:07,160
Because then he could say that we could find out about something in which the purely dew worlded, all we would need to know is its essence, and then we'd have the kind of science I think he thinks that we do have.

730
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:07,880
Period.

731
01:19:08,441 --> 01:19:10,281
We're going to go on to truth next time.

732
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:15,640
If those of you who like to think about this stuff could write a paper on it, I think it's really interesting.

733
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:20,120
Or you can just forget it and not have to suffer with it anymore.
