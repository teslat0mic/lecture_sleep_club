1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,719
There's one piece left over from last time, and we will do that first.

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:20,560
That is, we haven't gone from existential spatiality to physical, that is, Cartesian or whatever your current science is, view of space and nature.

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,479
And we have to go through that.

4
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:35,439
It's interesting because Heidegger goes, I'll show you, and it helps to remember exactly the same moves he goes through when he gets from the ready-to-hand to the present-at-hand in equipment.

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:49,119
He's going to get from ready-to-hand dealing with things space, spatiality, as he calls it, to get from spatiality to present-at-hand, Cartesian space.

6
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,679
So we'll do it.

7
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:58,799
And he's going to show a founding relation, as he calls it.

8
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:06,319
That is, he's going to show, as I understand founding relation, it's about intelligibility, not about causality.

9
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,079
So it's not a question to begin with.

10
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,759
We'll get back to it at the end.

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,599
What's the causal relation between Cartesian space and everyday spatiality.

12
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,279
The ontological question is: which can you make sense of which from?

13
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,039
That is intelligibility.

14
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:42,839
Can you make Cartesian space intelligible by relating it to lived space, of existential spatiality, or do you make existential spatiality somehow intelligible by relating it to extension?

15
00:01:42,839 --> 00:02:10,439
And of course, the answer, which is no big secret by now, it's really if once you describe the phenomena in its holism and in its richness, you discover that you can't build up the phenomena of existential spatiality out of the phenomena of minimal elements in an atomistic nature where you're just putting pieces together and so forth.

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,240
That we need to do it in detail.

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,359
So starting on 145 now.

18
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,759
So we're coming to the end of the spatiality chapter.

19
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,839
At the top of 145, we get section 24: space and Dasein spatiality.

20
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:35,399
That's just what I've been talking about.

21
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:48,999
And now he tells us about six or seven lines down in that section that starts at the top of 145, that is in the middle of 110 in the German.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:01,999
He says, we have now shown that circumspective being in the world is spatial, and only because Dasein is spatial in the way of de-distancing and directionality.

23
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,839
Sorry, I haven't put the accent in the wrong.

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:13,999
And only because Dasein is spatial, in the way of de-distancing and directionality, can what is ready to hand within the world be encountered in its spatiality.

25
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,080
That's the first part.

26
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:29,439
And then, skipping to the beginning of the next paragraph, the space which is thus disclosed with the worldhood of the world lacks the pure multiplicity of the three dimensions.

27
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:38,559
I mean, it hasn't got this homogeneous, every direction is equal, no here, no up and down, no right and left.

28
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,320
It doesn't have any of that.

29
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,640
It's funny to say lax as I read it.

30
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,240
The worldhood of the world lacks the pure multiplicity of the three dimensions.

31
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,199
I'd have to go back and look.

32
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,719
Who's got the German?

33
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,919
What?

34
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,079
Hot nicht.

35
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
Hot nicht.

36
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:58,800
Well, that pretty well could be.

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,760
Doesn't have.

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,360
Yeah, that's right, not lax.

39
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:01,839
Good.

40
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:02,720
Doesn't have.

41
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:09,119
I mean, lax makes it sound like, boy, this rich space of Descartes.

42
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,800
Sorry.

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:20,080
No, it looks like if you say lax, the meaningful existential space is missing these meaningless three dimensions.

44
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,039
Boy, if it had them, just think where it would be.

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,399
But that's ridiculous.

46
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,080
It isn't missing them.

47
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
It doesn't lack them.

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,399
You wouldn't know what to do with them and had them in science.

49
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,920
It just doesn't have them.

50
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
That's good.

51
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,640
Nice to have the German back there.

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,319
Okay, so now we can go on.

53
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,799
The space that so-and-so, wait, I'm going to write it in so next time I won't get upset about it.

54
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:54,279
Hot niched doesn't have, okay, doesn't have the pure multiplicity of the three dimensions.

55
00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:05,479
In this disclosedness, which is closest to us, space as the pure we're in in which positions are ordered by measurement and the situation of things are determined, what is all that?

56
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,479
That still remains hidden.

57
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:13,480
You notice there's always it's veiled, it's hidden, it's there, it's underlying.

58
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,719
And we saw that with the way the present at hand underlies the ready-to-hand.

59
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,520
So we haven't got to it yet.

60
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,599
It still remains hidden.

61
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:27,560
And now we're going to, so to speak, find it and hide it and so forth.

62
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,800
While I'm on it, I want to say something in answer to Curtis, who isn't over there today, maybe.

63
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:41,000
But in any case, I mean, he was right to keep pushing me about the causal underlying.

64
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,199
It isn't that, just don't even think about Heidegger.

65
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,439
Just think about reality.

66
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:59,480
It isn't as if we have a story about an account in science of how the space of science, whether, let's call it just Newtonian space.

67
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:03,079
I'm just talking about Curtis, trying to answer you.

68
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,520
Your timing is perfect.

69
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:20,120
It isn't as if we understand that the space that underlies the existential space, where I mean by underlies, and this is what I should have said, simply you couldn't get along without it.

71
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:34,799
If there wasn't Cartesian space, there wouldn't be the kind of basic distance of things from things, which underlies the more, much more complicated notion of what's really close and what isn't on the basis of interest in coping and so forth.

72
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:42,560
But there is closeness and betweenness and certain basic structural things, and they underlie the existential space.

73
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,640
We couldn't have it without it.

74
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,479
And back to the hammer.

75
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:57,840
When I don't mean to say that the shank of the hammer made of wood and the blob of the hammer made of steel are somehow causally related to the hammers being able to be a hammer.

76
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:06,000
You can't make causal laws from natural kinds of wood and metal that relate that to hammers.

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,520
I mean, there's no, that just does, they're not in the same dimensions.

78
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:21,120
I mean, hammers can come in all sorts of shapes and they can be made of other plastic instead of wood, and it's where they fit in the referential totality that makes them hammers.

79
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:29,839
But nonetheless, the properties of whatever the hammer is made of make it possible for the hammer to hammer.

80
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:42,319
You can't make the hammer out of butter or pillows, or you can't, it's got to be rigid, and it's got to be balanced, and those are physical characteristics.

81
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,360
So don't say causally underlies.

82
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,640
That's my mistake.

83
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,519
Then you start looking for laws, explanations.

84
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:59,680
There are no laws and explanations about how the natural kinds and their causal properties, namely that metal has causal properties and wood has causal properties.

85
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,200
There's not going to be a story how you get from those natural kinds with their causal properties to how you get to hammering.

86
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:19,160
You will have some kind of general theory about why the metal is har why metal is hard and so forth, but you won't be, there's no laws relating them.

87
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,719
Okay, so the same thing is going to be true about the space thing.

88
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,839
That's why I went back to it.

89
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:42,359
Whatever you're going to say about the space, whether it's Cartesian or Newtonian or Einsteinian, now it's curved and it's got time in it, whatever you're going to say about that underlies the fact that anything can be a distance from anything else, where distance is, remember, this physical story.

90
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,360
And if it weren't for things being distant from other things, you couldn't have them being near or far.

91
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:51,160
You couldn't bring them into the near-far business.

92
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,120
You couldn't be trying to get a nearer, better grip on them.

93
00:08:54,119 --> 00:09:00,040
All of that presupposes that there is this physical underlying structure.

94
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:07,800
This is very important to me, and I'll say something, one more thing about it, which is never, I mean, I really shouldn't, but I can't resist.

95
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:35,800
The big disagreement between me and Bill Blattner, which isn't going to come out in this course, but I'm going to say it anyway, is it only comes out in Division II, and it comes out when Blattner claims that Heidegger is trying to get all the properties of lived time, namely that it's a world time, it's shared time, there's a right time for doing things, it's got lots of existential properties.

96
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:48,920
And he says Heidegger fails to get one of the essential properties of time out of our, make sense of it in terms of our existential temporality, namely, succession.

97
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,120
Succession is for time, what distance is for space.

98
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:55,719
I think for Heidegger, succession is in the universe.

99
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,080
It's got to be there.

100
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:10,400
And then on the then that underlies the fact that we can have earlier and later, we can have a now, and all the stuff that isn't in succession is built on succession.

101
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,680
And so this fascinating thing, Blattner in two pages says, well, Heidegger can't explain succession.

102
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:28,400
He fails to do what he's trying to do, namely explain every aspect of temporality, give an account of every aspect of temporality on the basis of lived time.

103
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,479
Therefore, Heidegger's idealism fails.

104
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,800
That's why Heidegger didn't finish being in time.

105
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:43,440
That's why Heidegger gave up on the whole project and all on the assumption that Heidegger has to explain succession without physical time.

106
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
And I'm going to say the same thing is here for space.

107
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Heidegger does not have to explain distance, physical distance, in terms of something else, but lived, namely our interest or our coping capacities or anything else.

108
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
Distance is really there.

109
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,560
It's now I'm back to my this whole lecture, that whole little speech, that whole aria is about remains hidden.

110
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,080
I mean, the space of distance remains hidden.

111
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:25,040
It's there all along, back to what I'm saying, underlying the fact that we have lived space because we're in the world, there is this lived spatial world.

112
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,560
And moreover, you can't explain the lived spatial world in terms of distance.

113
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,440
But you can't explain nearness and remoteness without distance, either.

114
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,360
And you can't explain physical distance in terms of nearness and remoteness, I don't think.

115
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:48,839
And I think, at least that's what Heidegger, I think Heidegger and I agree against Bill on this.

116
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,719
I have to tell Bill to listen to this podcast.

117
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:54,039
See if we get a response.

118
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:57,560
Okay, anyway, that's now where are we?

119
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:23,960
So we're going to now strip away the levels of intelligibility that we as Dasein, with our meaningful dealing with things, have you don't want to say sort of projected on the basic existential onto the Cartesian space.

120
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,560
There's hardly any way to talk about it.

121
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:34,839
I mean, how could you project your interests onto this totally directionless, meaningless, no here kind of space?

122
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,879
You just got to try to get your head inside of this.

123
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,280
It's very, very interesting, but complicated.

124
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,280
And it gets even worse with temporality.

125
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,640
But stick to space.

126
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, it isn't as if somehow you put here, hereness, you know, we've got a space that's got a here in it.

127
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:58,519
It isn't any, it isn't somehow, you can't sort of project the here on Cartesian space.

128
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,720
It's just different.

129
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:03,160
There is Cartesian space, and it hasn't got any here in it.

130
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:12,760
But insofar as there are human beings, and human beings are in the world, there is spatiality, and it's got here and in it, and near and far and so forth.

131
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,360
And they depend on us as Daseins.

132
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:28,200
And how they're just, there's nothing you can say about how that relates to physical space that isn't going to get you into trouble, except maybe underlies something very, very minimal.

133
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,960
Okay, I'm falling back into this issue which obsesses me.

134
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Okay, so we're going to strip away intelligibility.

135
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:47,040
We're going to strip away live spatiality bit by bit and get to pure, meaningless, minimal Cartesian space.

136
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,600
So this starts on 137.

137
00:13:51,200 --> 00:14:01,040
I'm just going to go through it now because it's a kind of review of what happens with equipment, what happens with temporality beyond where you're going to be, and so forth.

138
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:11,360
So on page 137, we start out just below 104, about five lines.

139
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:22,640
Dasein, in its very being, has this being as an issue, and its concern discovers beforehand those regions in which some involvement is decisive.

140
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,399
It's so interesting and weird.

141
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,839
I mean, it discovers it.

142
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,280
Well, discovers it, but it wasn't there before Dasein came around and discovered it.

143
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,399
It's not what's hidden.

144
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,599
He's so tricky.

145
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,599
I mean, the regions aren't hidden.

146
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,040
They in Cartesian space.

147
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:47,040
They're just, there are only regions, like workshops and sunny sides of the house when Dasein's around.

148
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,719
Anyway, so here we are.

149
00:14:48,719 --> 00:15:03,760
Dasein, the discovery of regions beforehand, that is, it's always already the space of regions, regions, is co-determined by the totality of involvements for which the ready-to-hand, if something encountered, is freed.

150
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,879
Now, we won't sink back into freed from last time, although that was all illuminating.

151
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:15,599
And I will come back to it later when we read a certain word, which is going to cause lots of new confusions.

152
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,400
But anyway, let's go on right now here.

153
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:23,240
The readiness to hand, which belongs to any such region beforehand, has the character of inconspicuous familiarity.

154
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,520
I just want you to realize that you start always at the ground floor of familiarity.

155
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:36,440
That's got in it our understanding of being, as he says at the end of the worldhood chapter.

156
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,720
That's the, you like the familiarity of the room.

157
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:51,960
The fact that we are just always in a world in which everything is already near and far and right and left and up and down and front and back and every, all that, we don't even notice it.

158
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,400
We take it for granted.

159
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,000
That's the inconspicuousness of the familiarity.

160
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:57,960
And it's got to be.

161
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,440
That's right.

162
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,200
We're not going to be paying attention to that.

163
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:10,839
We've got business to pay attention to on the basis of the way the space is already, always already beforehand, they talk like here, familiar to us.

164
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:20,920
That, of course, it was, we weren't born that way, but by the time we get to be grown up or adolescent Daseine, it's all always already familiar to us.

165
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:31,479
So now, so we start there, and now, and that's also tied up with the ready-to-hand, which has its own inconspicuous familiarity.

166
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:45,080
You remember, it withdraws the more the hammer working well, and the more skill you have with the hammer, the more familiarity you have with that kind of hammer and that kind of wood, the more the whole thing can be done without paying any attention at all.

167
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:57,400
But then something starts, it can go wrong, or even, I imagine, go well, in which it's so much better than you ever had it before that you notice that it's good that it is.

168
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,999
Of course, if you do, you spoil it, and you won't be in flow anymore.

169
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:06,960
But anyway, something happens to call your attention to the unready-to-hand.

170
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,000
And that's on 138 as he starts talking about that.

171
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,399
Once you look for these things, they're sort of scattered around, but you can put them together in a coherent story.

172
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:26,079
And start at the very bottom of 137, in the German on 104, about a third of the way down.

173
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,999
The regions itself become visible in a conspicuous manner.

174
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:40,799
Remember, conspicuous is the name for what happens when something goes wrong or isn't normal, and what you're doing, you have to pay attention to what you're doing.

175
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:49,920
The region itself becomes visible in a conspicuous manner only when one discovers the ready-to-hand circumspectively and does so in the deficient mode of concern.

176
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:57,359
Remember, deficient mode means you're not just swinging along in flow, but there's problems.

177
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,479
Often, the region of a place does not become accessible explicitly as such a region until one fails to find something in its place.

178
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:05,680
That's nice.

179
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:11,999
He talked about the problem of failing to find the hammer and how that makes the hammer in the workshop show up.

180
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:19,839
And now he's saying, and if you don't find the hammer, it also makes the place where the hammer ought to be show up, as the place where the hammer ought to be.

181
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:30,399
The space which is discovered in circumspective being in the world is the spatiality of the totality of equipment always belongs to entities themselves as the place of that totality.

182
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,519
The bare space itself is still veiled over.

183
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:44,399
When you look for it, that refrain is constantly there, telling you, well, there's Cartesian space there all along, but we haven't got to it yet, and so we'll go further.

184
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,960
On 146, he takes it up again.

185
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:58,440
So at the bottom in German, doesn't seem to have any German page.

186
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,319
Very near the bottom of 111.

187
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:16,440
Okay, at the bottom paragraph for us on 146, the spatiality of what is proximately uncountered in circumspection can become a theme for circumspection itself, as well as a task for calculation and measurement, as in building and surveying.

188
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,479
Now that's interesting.

189
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:25,640
That's not necessarily a breakdown, but that is sort of calling attention to what is usually just familiar and taken for granted.

190
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:35,479
You can start measuring your living room for the carpet you're going to get, where you're no longer in the walking on the carpet transparently, familiarly just dealing with it.

191
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:39,000
You are paying attention to it, but you're still involved.

192
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,080
And remember, that's the crucial thing.

193
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,160
You're going to see the switchover in a minute.

194
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:52,119
All the unready-to-hand stuff is always on the background of wanting to make it useful and easy to use and so forth.

195
00:19:52,120 --> 00:20:02,039
It's always, it's deficient in the sense that it's not working transparently and well as it should be, and then it becomes conspicuous.

196
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:06,440
And one of the ways it can become conspicuous isn't a kind of breakdown.

197
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:17,880
I want you to get over the idea which Heidegger makes you into by bringing up the first examples of deficiency and the first transition to the unready-to-hand by breakdown.

198
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,279
Remember, something gets in the way, can't find the hammer, and so forth.

199
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:30,520
But he does already mention, but way, I point way back in the book, to the fact that not all unready-to-hand stuff has to be breaking down.

200
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:36,160
There's inspecting, he says, how's the assembly line doing and whatever.

201
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:48,159
And here, again, so building and surveying isn't a kind of breakdown, but it's still some, but it's something we do that makes something that was before inconspicuous conspicuous, and we can measure it.

202
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,479
That's at the bottom of 146.

203
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:56,160
The space thus shows itself to be studied purely by beholding it.

204
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:03,920
If one gives up what was formerly the only possibility of access to it, circumspective calculation, that is a very fast move.

205
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,839
I think probably very few of you will see it until you're looking for it.

206
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,680
He's just gone from unready-to-hand to presence at hand.

207
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,479
What he later, way back on page 114, makes big of a fuss about, namely the switchover, the deworlding.

208
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:38,079
Instead of building and surveying, which is measuring all right, but it's measuring in the interest of knowing how much, how far you have to build your fence or where your property line is and all that, part of our everyday way of life.

209
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:43,680
You can just stare at them and it's the purely by looking at it.

210
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:54,239
Whenever you get that, purely by looking at it, you've gone out of your world of circumspective concern into a world of just plain observing.

211
00:21:54,239 --> 00:22:01,039
And then he says, so the space which thus shows up.

212
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,839
So you see what I'm now hope I haven't messed it up.

213
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,599
I think it sounds like I have it.

214
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,559
I mustn't.

215
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,120
Let's see.

216
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:14,640
Such thematization of the spatiality of the environment is still predominantly, ah, good, an act of circumspection by which space becomes into view in a certain way.

217
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,039
Good.

218
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,560
The space which less those up can be studied.

219
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:24,279
Now, the next move can also be studied in a different way purely by looking at it.

220
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,599
Boom, we're done with building and surveying.

221
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:36,599
And that's what gives us if one gives up what was formerly the only possible access to it, namely circumspective calculation.

222
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,279
So you give up circumspection, that's deworlding.

223
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:47,160
Now you're looking at space intuitively, formally, as formal relations, and so forth.

224
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,719
And I think, I mean, there's this access word which is very important too.

225
00:22:55,719 --> 00:23:07,160
So the only way to get at space when you're measuring and building is in the context of circumspection, background stuff, skills, taking for granted.

226
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:14,599
But once you get into this pure looking, that gives you access to pure space.

227
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,960
That's science.

228
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,639
That's pure discovery.

229
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,680
Okay, so let's go on now that we've got that.

230
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,200
We did the switchover.

231
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,239
On 146.

232
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,519
Now I say go to 138.

233
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,960
He's going to summarize it.

234
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,919
I go back and forth because he goes back and forth.

235
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,319
So 138.

236
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,799
Okay, yes, he's summarizing before he begins to actually do it what he's going to be doing.

237
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:52,200
And that's at the last chunk, ten lines before section 23.

238
00:23:52,519 --> 00:24:08,479
The environment does not arrange itself in a space which has been given in advance, but its specific worldhood, in its significance, articulates the concept, context of involvement, which belongs to some current totality of circumspective allotted places.

239
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:13,519
The world at such a time always reveals the spatiality of the space which belongs to it.

240
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:21,120
The encounter to encounter the ready-to-hand in its environmental space remains ontically possible only because Dasein is spatial.

241
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,839
Wow, I don't know why I'm reading that.

242
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,680
Let me see on page one.

243
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,119
Why am I saying this?

244
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,319
I say that's a summary.

245
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,520
It doesn't seem to me a summary.

246
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:33,279
Sorry, don't worry about page 138 right now.

247
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,559
I'm still should be staying in the unready to hand.

248
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,559
I got way too quickly.

249
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,440
So there's always sort of the difficulties of things.

250
00:24:43,440 --> 00:25:00,479
I just wanted to, like the hammer being too heavy, if you look at the bottom of 140, you find that this is German 106, you find a pathway which is long objectively can be shorter than the one which is shorter, objectively shorter, but which is perhaps hard going.

251
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,479
See, it's hard going.

252
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:04,559
That's like it's too heavy.

253
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,719
It makes the unready to hand show up.

254
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,160
He's not stressing that there, but I just wanted to keep this parallel in mind.

255
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,200
And now we get to the switchover.

256
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,319
I don't want to say, I got there too soon.

257
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,200
Not that anything went wrong, because he did switch over there.

258
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,399
I don't take it back.

259
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,399
It's just that I hadn't finished what I wanted to do before he switched over.

260
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,719
Now I'm the bottom of 146.

261
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,719
And at the bottom of 146, the part I just read is the switchover.

262
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,399
I won't read it again.

263
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:53,799
And so at the top of 147, you get in the second paragraph of 147 the whole story, and which he sort of now he's summing up.

264
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,719
So let me try that.

265
00:25:55,719 --> 00:26:06,999
When space is discovered non-circumspectively by just looking at it, you see, we're just taking up where I should have been, the environmental regions get neutralized to pure dimensions.

266
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:16,039
Places, and indeed the whole circumspectively oriented totality of places belonging to equipment ready to hand gets reduced to a multiplicity of positions for random things.

267
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,559
You recognize what's happening.

268
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,719
You're getting physical space.

269
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:25,319
The spatiality of what is ready to hand within the world loses its involvement character, and so does the ready-to-hand.

270
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,639
The world loses its specific aroundness.

271
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,639
I mean, there's no here anymore.

272
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,200
The environment becomes the world of nature.

273
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:43,000
The world, as the totality of equipment ready-to-hand becomes spatialized to a context of extended things which are just present at hand and no more, the homogeneous space of nature shows itself.

274
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,599
Now it's not hidden anymore.

275
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:53,160
Only when the entities we encounter are discovered in such a way that the worldly character of the ready-to-hand gets specifically deprived of its worldhood.

276
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,839
See, I jumped ahead and talked about deworlding at the bottom of 46.

277
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:05,559
It was already there at that last sentence on 46, but he makes it explicit here on 147.

278
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,119
And now we've got the switch over.

279
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,440
And I think I don't need to say more about it.

280
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:18,040
And yet I have, as if I had something more to say about it.

281
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,399
So let me think a minute.

282
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:21,639
147.

283
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,999
Oh, yes.

284
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:25,559
Okay.

285
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,520
Yes, I do.

286
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,359
At the top of 147.

287
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,719
You're not going to understand this because we're not mathematicians or geometers.

288
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:41,519
But Heidegger just decides to sort of show off and run through a bunch of mathematical things, which he presumably understands.

289
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:51,440
He gets it from a student of his named Otto Becker, who he, one of the few students of his, he actually writes, has sort of got something right, learned something important.

290
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:58,479
And Becker did a whole book about the various levels of space that you could get by leaving out more and more, apparently.

291
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:09,440
So at the top of 147, he says, one may go through a series of stages in laying bare pure homogeneous space, passing from pure morphology of spatial shapes to analysis in situs.

292
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,639
I don't know what all this means.

293
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,839
And finally, to the purely metrical science of space.

294
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,639
In our present study, we shall not consider how these are all interconnected.

295
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:37,359
Our problematic, the ontological one, is to designate, is merely designed to establish ontologically the phenomenal basis upon which one can take the discovery of pure space as a theme of investigation and work it in, which we just sort of half did.

296
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,919
I mean, that's as far as he wants to go with it.

297
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,479
Now, I have to go back and see.

298
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:49,680
Oh, yeah, then he sums it up one more time on 413.

299
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Remember, it's always back there.

300
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:58,319
You're going to go if you're interested in these questions, because that's where he starts on 412 with the hammer, and then he does the hammer is too heavy.

301
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,999
And I thought it would be nice to go the rest of the way with him.

302
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:09,519
And that means on 413, the middle paragraph in German uh 361.

303
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,759
I'm going to read some of it.

304
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:30,680
Um I don't see what I want to read yet.

305
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,519
Okay, I think it's here with the hammer.

306
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:38,680
Yes, starting in the second sentence of that middle paragraph, he brings it together with the hammer.

307
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:47,880
In the physical assertion the hammer is heavy, we overlook not only the tool character of the entity we encounter, but something that belongs to any ready-to-hand equipment, its place.

308
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,519
So now he's going to do it for space.

309
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,520
Its place becomes a matter of indifference.

310
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:59,719
This does not mean that what is present at hand loses its location altogether, but its place becomes a spatiotemporal position.

311
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:14,279
See, it's no longer the hammer's got a place in the workshop, and it must be four feet from here and five, I don't know, three feet from the floor or something and so forth.

312
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,039
But that's all that's left.

313
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,880
It's not the place of the hammer anymore.

314
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,200
It's just a place like any other place.

315
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,879
It's just got its longitude and latitude or whatever coordinates you've got.

316
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,920
So let's go there.

317
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,119
Let's see now.

318
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,119
Place becomes a matter of indifference.

319
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:42,279
This does not mean that what is present at hand loses its location altogether, but its place becomes a spatiotemporal position, a world point, which is in no way distinguishable from any other.

320
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,080
Now comes something we're going to have to argue about or worry about for just a moment.

321
00:30:47,079 --> 00:31:01,319
This implies not only that the multiplicity of places of equipment ready to hand within the confines of the environment becomes modified to pure multiplicity of positions, but that the entities of the environment are altogether released from such confinement.

322
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:06,079
The aggregate of the present hand becomes the theme.

323
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,440
Isn't that interesting?

324
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,960
I mean, that's what I like or puzzle, I don't know whether I'm liking it or puzzled by it, this released business.

325
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:27,039
It seems like just as you can free the chalk by taking it up and using it and then let it do its thing, now comes something that's like that and yet just the opposite of that.

326
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:43,360
You can release geometrical space by taking away from it everything that has to do with using it, deworlding it, taking it out of circumspection, and then you release, I think it's a different word than, I mean, I'm sure it's a different German word than free.

327
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,239
What is it?

328
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,359
And shrinked out of being bound up.

329
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,200
So, but the important thing is, and release is a good translation.

330
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:11,279
So, the important thing is there's two different stories, but they've got the same idea that there's some phenomenon which is got to be covered up and kept in the background, and then, but you can bring it into the foreground and notice it and pay attention to it.

331
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,879
With freeing the chalk, that means I take it, start picking it up and getting ready to use it.

332
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,359
And now we discover you can do the opposite thing.

333
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:28,639
You can just take away all Dasein relative characteristics, and just what's left?

334
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,999
Well, just pure homogeneous space, and that's now released, meaning uncovered.

335
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:39,120
I guess the I mean, uncovered does a good job.

336
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,839
Yeah.

337
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:48,600
We deworld them.

338
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,879
Yes, we deworld them.

339
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:54,359
The entities, we see the hammer by just sheer looking at it.

340
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,799
We don't see it as something for hammering anymore.

341
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:07,719
And we just see it as this, the way the Bushman in the Gods Must Be Crazy would see it, just as a physical thing with physical properties.

342
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:24,359
And that means that both we have deworlded it in that we've now sort of looked at it without any respect to any use the Dasein could put of it, could put it in.

343
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,880
And we're not revealing its worldhood.

344
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,479
We're revealing its way of being as present at hand.

345
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,559
To reveal worldhood, you've got to have something more dramatic.

346
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,800
You've got to really have a breakdown, I think.

347
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,079
This is illuminating.

348
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:47,960
I mean, when the hammer is missing and you can't hammer anymore, then the worldhood of the world obtrudes itself, I think.

349
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,719
That's the phrase Heidegger uses.

350
00:33:49,720 --> 00:34:00,840
Because there you see the workshop and all the stuff is organized in terms of a referential totality, and it's all the way you, the carpenter, are trying to take a stand on your being, and all of that's not working.

351
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,119
And so you notice it.

352
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:02,999
I take it.

353
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:11,719
And the other way which you'll get to that you can notice worldhood is again when it's not working, and that's in anxiety.

354
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,640
And we'll have a lot to say about that.

355
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,960
And that's where that phrase comes from.

356
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,400
Then the pure presence at hand obtrudes itself.

357
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,359
That's the phrase.

358
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:24,519
And then we confront worldhood.

359
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,440
So that's, there has to be a really, really, I think this is right.

360
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,199
I have never really thought about it this way.

361
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:49,920
There's got to be a really dramatic, total breakdown before world and familiarity's got to be wiped out, for instance, before worldhood can stop being inconspicuous and withdrawn and show up just because it isn't working for you anymore.

362
00:34:50,320 --> 00:35:08,160
It's like a piece of equipment which is when worldhoods make when you no longer can use the stuff in the world to take a stand on your own being, then the whole referential totality looks like a piece of broken equipment, namely broken equipment for t using stuff to take a stand on your being.

363
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,999
And then you're in real trouble.

364
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:12,319
And then when we get to anxiety, yeah, yeah.

365
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,160
Two comments.

366
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:15,519
I don't know.

367
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:21,840
I just wonder if there's a if I can think there between space and place.

368
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,679
The ending attract us now.

369
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:30,639
Whether they use space and descriptive instead of mental underlyingly, definitely.

370
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:33,599
Positions, I think, is the word for what you get instead of space.

371
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,479
And place.

372
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:35,839
Place is definitely.

373
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,999
It's always.

374
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:46,560
Place is always the place for the hammer, the place in the workshop, and so forth.

375
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:48,960
And position, I think, is the would be the word.

376
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,840
I don't know where he uses it for the the deworlded one.

377
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,880
That's good, yeah.

378
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:07,680
The other thing is, it seems like he's he's only interested in space and that underlying insofar as we're able to encounter it from some phenomenal basis, namely from that.

379
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,999
Given familiarity that we're having.

380
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:10,400
Right, yeah.

381
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,759
What are the conditions for the principle that you have our being able to come?

382
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,479
Space, geospatiality.

383
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:42,199
Yeah, in the extensive spatiality, we can encounter space as homogeneous, homogeneous, and empty when we just stare at it in this theoretical attitude and deworld it.

384
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,120
Yes, right.

385
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,319
Yes.

386
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,639
And how else could it come up?

387
00:36:53,639 --> 00:37:00,360
I mean, if it came up in a kind of naturalism way, Heidegger would just say you just haven't studied the phenomenon.

388
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:13,080
If you did, you'd see how hard, how impossible it was to capture that holistic, meaningful phenomenon in terms of explaining it, in terms of the stuff moving around.

389
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:13,880
Yeah.

390
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,880
Which is why the, I mean, in principle, there can be no story about.

391
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,599
That's right.

392
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:22,599
I keep wanting to back down on that.

393
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:22,920
Right.

394
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,479
There's nothing to no story to tell, except that it is underlying.

395
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,840
And if you miss that, you're in the Bill Blattner mess, it seems to me.

396
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:39,720
Namely, you think Heidegger's got to explain distance and succession as somehow based on our existential something or other.

397
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,960
And I think Heidegger thinks that you don't.

398
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,519
By the way, if you want the nearest thing of evidence for my position, it's a funny sentence.

399
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,360
At the end of the history of the concept of time.

400
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,319
Look at the end of the history of the concept of time.

401
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,679
This is what I consider sort of devastating objection to Bill Blattner.

402
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:01,960
Heidegger talks about the time-free movements of nature, quote-unquote.

403
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:13,440
I take it what that means is, if time for him is like temporality, meaning human-related, time is like spatiality.

404
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:20,080
That's complicated because space for him is non-human related, and spatiality is human-related.

405
00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:23,200
That's why the time chapter is so much harder.

406
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,120
For Heidegger, temporality is like spatiality.

407
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,639
But temporality is also called time, because being in time really is being in temporality.

408
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,920
It's not being in clock time.

409
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:48,640
So now what I'm trying to say is the time-free movements of nature, at the end of the basic problems, is just succession without any earlier and later and without any now.

410
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:50,399
And boy, is that hard to think.

411
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,120
But that point isn't whether we can think it or not.

412
00:38:53,119 --> 00:39:08,479
The point is that it's clear that something like succession is still left, even when temporality, namely all this about earlier and later and now and stuff, is gone and you're in nature.

413
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,920
And so, anyway, so it's again, it's this interesting story.

414
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:23,280
And enough, I obsess about this because I respect Bill so much, and I think he's by far got the deepest understanding of anybody of being in time.

415
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,960
But on this crunching point, I don't believe him.

416
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,440
Okay, somebody had a hand up over here?

417
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,360
Oh, back in the back.

418
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,319
Tyler, yeah.

419
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:45,679
Well, that's what I suspected, and I sort of hinted that we would fall back into the free discussion if we didn't even look at this, but let's hope so.

420
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:46,720
How?

421
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,880
Okay, good.

422
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,680
Let's try.

423
00:39:52,679 --> 00:40:04,840
When something is freed or released, as I want to put it, it becomes accessible to our phenomenological investigation, at least.

424
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,159
But that's not the whole story.

425
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:21,639
But whatever it is that's been withdrawn and doing its job by being essentially inconspicuous is no, scratch that, both of those things.

426
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,680
That's not right.

427
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,719
I have to try again.

428
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,800
When the chalk is freed, I don't know.

429
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,880
Give me time to think about it.

430
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,679
I just don't know how to what more to say about it.

431
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:34,519
Yeah, Curtis, you want to try?

432
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:35,159
Yeah, I'm sorry.

433
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,840
Freed the first sense.

434
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,360
They're freed for our circumspective concern.

435
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,479
That's right.

436
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,519
They see where you actually evolve it.

437
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:56,039
Freed in the first sense is an existential already being in the world, already free for our circumspective concerns.

438
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,639
In this sense, it's an ontic example, where we're actually releasing evolving.

439
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,719
I would have said just the other way around.

440
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,679
I'm not going to talk about it anymore.

441
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:11,719
To come and talk to me in office hours or make an appointment, I just don't really have.

442
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,640
What's bothering me isn't what's bothering everybody else, I think.

443
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,559
I just want to understand these words sort of intuitively.

444
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:22,200
Why would he say that the chalk was free?

445
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,599
And I think it's ontically freed.

446
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,040
I think it's when we pick it up and write with it that it's freed.

447
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:28,999
But freed?

448
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,999
I'm not going to go back over it.

449
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:32,319
And now released?

450
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:38,960
I mean, so the three dimensions of Cartesian space are released where have they been before they were released?

451
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,560
I mean, I just don't get it.

452
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,479
I think Heidi was pretty careful with the sort of nuances of his language.

453
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:49,440
And I just find that is wait, let's hear about the German.

454
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,560
Given for, okay, well, that's freed, all right.

455
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:01,599
Removing limits.

456
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,560
So it's been, it's Einschronk, it's been sort of contained within these limits, and now we're going to take the limits off.

457
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,839
And that's a little better.

458
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,719
But I mean, it's all, it's funny.

459
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,960
I'll say this, which will really confuse everybody.

460
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,640
Because if you look at the German, you could translate all of our dealing with objects as objects encounter us.

461
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,639
Unspagnen.

462
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,040
And how weird that is.

463
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:40,720
But I think that weird is the right kind of weird, because I think he thinks that the objects are drawing us in and so forth, that they're much more active in our everyday world than Cartesian objects, which just lie around.

464
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,079
So now there's a neat use, only our translator covers it up.

465
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:50,719
Whenever you're looking at it, if you think about objects, how objects encounter us, it sometimes is helpful.

466
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:57,359
Now, but I don't see that the free giving freedom or taking away limits is what's happening.

467
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:00,239
That points towards something phenomenological.

468
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,839
I knew we would fall into limits.

469
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,720
Yes.

470
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:05,999
Ah.

471
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,800
Oh, good.

472
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,679
So it's a little serious.

473
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:18,280
He's saying, like, okay, Frei Gaben, you guys will have to discuss this, is not giving freedom, but the Freyan would be giving freedom.

474
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,799
Liberate a person.

475
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,519
Okay, and Freigabin, what is that?

476
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,639
It seems that somebody did a good username and somebody in a hospital.

477
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,040
It's fun block.

478
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,039
Making available.

479
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:35,720
Wow, unblocking.

480
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,279
Good.

481
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,639
So you can't, I'm repeating what Eugene has just said.

482
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:46,120
So you can Freigabin, you can set free damsels in distress and prisoners.

483
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,479
And that's what I'm getting in my way with the, what?

484
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:51,400
That gets in the way of the other one.

485
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,079
You can't set free chalk, damsels, and prisoners in distress, all with the same verb.

486
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:59,239
So that's, okay, that's Freigabin.

487
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,999
Ah, is this seat free?

488
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:05,719
That's neat.

489
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,280
Yes.

490
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,599
Desponiva in French.

491
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,359
I don't know how to say it in English.

492
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,919
But anyway, so that's it.

493
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,159
Well, you had another way of putting it with free in it.

494
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,999
You say it again.

495
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:22,679
Making available.

496
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,439
Great.

497
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,760
So you're not freeing it from anything.

498
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:30,279
I think that's wonderful.

499
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,079
Just remember, all this discussion has been worth it.

500
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:37,479
If every time you hear freeing the chalk, you hear, is this seat free?

501
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,599
Because you don't want to say, well, is this, see, I've been in prison and you've just rescued it.

502
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,720
But you mean, is it available?

503
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,720
So the chalk becomes available.

504
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,359
What?

505
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,320
Terrific.

506
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,919
Okay, now we can go on.

507
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:52,600
It was worth going back.

508
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,519
But where are we?

509
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:57,880
I'm very near the end of this because I want to go on to the next thing.

510
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,999
So we did that.

511
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:08,640
And I want to just write down here, just in case I should forget this, which I doubt.

512
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,799
Is this seat free?

513
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,920
Great.

514
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:14,799
So I have to think, is this chalk free?

515
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,999
But you can get there.

516
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,840
Maybe it was somebody else's chalk and they didn't want anybody to use it.

517
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,479
Okay.

518
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,319
Note that Tartesian space has been there all along, I say, in my notes.

519
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,720
Haven't I said that a dozen times already?

520
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,519
But let's look at 136 and see why I feel that I should go on.

521
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,839
I have nauseum about this point.

522
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,079
136.

523
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:40,960
See?

524
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:42,880
It's the same.

525
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,919
Oh, I got it.

526
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,519
Yes, I've done that quote.

527
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:46,320
So let's go on.

528
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,040
It underlies, doesn't cause, I've done that.

529
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:50,400
Oh, yeah.

530
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,280
The last thing I just want to say, I said it already, but this time I'm ready to say it again.

531
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,040
It's important that Descartes got something right.

532
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:08,080
His talk about race extensa is really a deep understanding of the way natural science works and should work.

533
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:24,320
I want to keep repeating this because it looks like you'd think that Descartes who invented both subjects and objects, though there were substances but no objects, and there were people and souls but no subjects until Descartes came along and defined these interesting terms.

534
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:30,239
But I've got to keep reminding you, he's got it all wrong, and we're going to come back to that in a minute, about us.

535
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,200
We are not going to be treatable as present-at-hand substances.

536
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:45,439
And whenever he tries to do it, you get this, you know, self-contained minds, and you're at at Husserl or Searle or Leibniz or Kant or whoever.

537
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,759
Anyway, so Descartes just got it wrong about us, about Dasein.

538
00:46:46,479 --> 00:46:53,320
But that doesn't mean that he's got it wrong about objects.

539
00:46:53,639 --> 00:47:13,239
In fact, he made a big help, a big breakthrough away from Aristotle and Galileo by giving us a description of nature as it is, absolutely independent of us and our access practices and our interests and our bodies and perception and everything.

540
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:23,160
And now he didn't get it right because he didn't have any good ontology for it, but he got it right in that he was on the right track.

541
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:24,279
So let me read that.

542
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:31,720
Starting on the very end of the previous section, above section C, on page 134.

543
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:52,759
But if we recall that spatiality is manifestly one of the constituents of entities within the world, then in the end, the Cartesian analysis of the world can still be rescued, quote, around world because it's the totality of entities, quote, around rescued because it was never really in trouble, I take it.

544
00:47:52,760 --> 00:48:05,159
Now, skipping a little, within certain limits, the analysis of the extensio, res extensa, the extended something or other, remains independent of Descartes.

545
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:10,840
That is his neglecting to provide an explicit interpretation of the being of extended entities.

546
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:24,199
Heidegger's got a whole place for the present at hand, and what kind of being that is, and how that's related to us, namely related to us by not being related to us.

547
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:26,120
But there's a whole story about that.

548
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,279
But Descartes hasn't got that.

549
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:56,879
But so there's some phenomenal justification for regarding the extensio as a basic characteristic of the world, with quotes, even if by recourse to this, neither the spatiality of the world, and that means the human spatial world, nor the entities we encounter in our environment, a spatiality which is proximately discovered, nor even that of Dasein himself can be conceived ontologically.

550
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:13,360
That is, Descartes hasn't got a whole ontology in which the present-at-hand nature of the extended, meaningless, homogeneous space fits into a whole picture of how they make each other intelligible and so forth.

551
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,479
But he's right.

552
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,239
But there was another quote.

553
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,920
I wonder why I don't have it.

554
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:25,440
Maybe it was because I was seeing it in basic problems or in the history of the concept of time.

555
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:27,119
Does it say that here?

556
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,599
That he thereby lays the basis for physics as the modern physics?

557
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,920
I think it does, but I haven't found it.

558
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:39,279
He prepared the way for, yeah, I've got a little earlier I skipped it.

559
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:45,840
He prepared the way for the understanding of something a priori whose content was established with greater penetration.

560
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:52,720
That is, he understood that there was this basic structure.

561
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,120
That isn't even that isn't what I want.

562
00:49:55,519 --> 00:50:01,999
Right around here somewhere, he says that well, the point is simply that Descartes was in.

563
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:27,880
I guess it's in that there's just phenomenal justification for regarding extensio as a basic characteristic of the world and so forth, period.

564
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:36,600
I mean, in other words, it's Descartes got something right, there is an underlying something or other, and it is a homogeneous underlying something or other.

565
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:43,560
And if he understood that there were other modes of being, he could say the mode of being of it was presence of hand, and that would be illuminating.

566
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:46,920
But he's on the right track toward modern science.

567
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:55,320
Remember, just to make this clear, maybe, Aristotle thought that things had natural places, that places were part of nature.

568
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:08,679
And Descartes and Galileo had to fight this big battle to get rid of the idea that there was an up and a down in nature and the things, the heavy things, had their natural place at the center of the earth and so forth.

569
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:11,880
Descartes wiped places out of nature.

570
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,479
And that's a big achievement.

571
00:51:13,479 --> 00:51:14,840
And you don't want to knock him for it.

572
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,279
You want to congratulate him for it.

573
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,400
That's what Heidegger thinks.

574
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:17,559
Yeah.

575
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:35,960
Well, let's not talk about that.

576
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,599
I see that it's true that he's saying that.

577
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,920
I can't understand why he's saying it.

578
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,119
That's why I skipped it.

579
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:52,839
Because it isn't as if Descartes, as if Heidegger believes that never, I think, thinks that time is really an a priori form of our intuition.

580
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,200
Heaven forbid.

581
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:55,960
So we'll talk about it later.

582
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,759
Puzzling.

583
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,319
Okay, I'm ready to go on to the whole next section.

584
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,239
Everybody clear their heads.

585
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,479
We finished space.

586
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,760
It's really fascinating, but we've got to go on.

587
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:17,440
My bottom line, summing up, is that Descartes is right about the res extensa, but he's wrong about the res cogitans.

588
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:27,519
And what you can't, and then the bottom line of this is you can't account for the richness of existential space by putting together anything you can find in physical space.

589
00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:52,640
The only way to make things intelligible is to see the physical space is arrived at by leaving out the richness of the original of spatiality, and that you can't get that richness back from the underlying physical space.

590
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:54,639
That's the picture.

591
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:55,440
Very sense.

592
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:57,759
Heidegger's being very sensible.

593
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,920
Whenever Heidegger gets to science, it seems to me, he's always being very sensible.

594
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,639
But now, here's a big transition to the next thing.

595
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,079
So this is fine with me.

596
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:17,279
I want to do other minds roughly today and do the chapter on the they Tuesday so that you have time.

597
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:23,120
And that's the end of the part that the paper topics are on, so that you have time to digest all that.

598
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,320
So here's a sort of orienting comment I want to make.

599
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:42,879
There seem to be four separate attacks on the ego or the cogito or the self-sufficient mind or whatever, the subject, all those bad Cartesian things.

600
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:52,999
There's an attack on the mind or the ego as a container of intentional contents.

601
00:53:52,999 --> 00:54:11,880
Whenever you hear this phrase, which all my colleagues use with such facility, the intentional content of this or that, you've got to realize that the notion of content, in Husserl anyway, really means that it's inside the mind, that it's be there whether there was any world or not.

602
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:27,799
So Heinheid is going to get us out of this notion of intentional content, and he's going to get us out of the notion that all meaning somehow has to be accounted for in terms of the intentional content, which Searle thinks, calls the intrinsic meaning that the mind has and puts on everything.

603
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,440
And Husserl certainly had that view too.

604
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:45,960
So he's going and he's going to show that there just isn't any such self-contained mind which is the source of meaning.

605
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,999
And now I'm going to say there are four ways he does it.

606
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:52,360
And we've seen two of them so far and we're going to see two of them now.

607
00:54:52,360 --> 00:55:02,519
So far, he's argued, and this is my favorite part, that there's a more primordial kind of intentionality than the kind that has intentional content.

608
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:31,600
That is, a kind of intentionality that isn't trying to do something, doesn't have goals, doesn't have conditions of satisfaction, but is our holistic background familiarity with the world, which is not directed toward objects, doesn't have any goals, not a kind of intentionality at all, but is the condition of the possibility of the the normal Husserl-Searrell kind of intentionality.

609
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,799
I really smushed two things together there, which I now wonder whether I have to sort them out.

610
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,680
I'd have five if I did that.

611
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:41,039
I guess I have to have five.

612
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:42,160
Oh, my goodness.

613
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:45,840
Okay, let me divide that into two.

614
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:58,800
There is, first he makes the move, this is just a review, from the kind of intentionality that Husserl and Searle is talking about, which is every normal intentionality, to what he calls more primordial intentionality.

615
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,320
And that gets you to coping, through dealing.

616
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:13,279
That's the kind of intentionality in flow, in which it's already true there that you're not trying to do anything, not trying to do anything, but you have conditions of satisfaction.

617
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:20,479
You either succeed in winning the chess game or making the tennis point or getting through the door or you don't.

618
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:37,999
Then there's this weird thing that if you put together these primordial intentionality copings so that they are all in a big hole, like coping with the room, then it no longer is a kind of dealing or coping that has a goal and that you can try to do.

619
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:41,359
Just try to cope with the room, and what would that be like?

620
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:43,599
Could you succeed or coping with the room?

621
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:51,680
Maybe you could fail by sort of tripping over the benches and falling flat on your face, but you don't, that's pretty, that'd be pretty peculiar.

622
00:56:51,679 --> 00:57:19,560
So there is now not only, first you go from Husserl intentionality, which is all intentional content and subject-oriented, to primordial intentionality, which is Dasein dealing in an openness with the world kind of intentionality, to familiarity, which isn't even a kind of intentionality at all, but which is a kind of background know-how that is there making both other kinds of intentionality possible.

623
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,759
That's move one and two.

624
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,320
And then three, these are all things we've done already.

625
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,800
The self and the world are interdefined.

626
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:40,680
So he's going to keep telling you that the self is the stand you take on yourself, and you can't take a stand on yourself except by using shared equipment in a shared world.

627
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:53,400
And so then, again, not only have you gotten rid of the subject, which is the first and second one, you get rid of the self, which is a broader notion.

628
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:56,839
Whatever there is, self, soul, so forth.

629
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,879
The first one is ego and subject.

630
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:05,320
Second one, he's getting rid of the self because he says it's defined in terms of the world.

631
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:10,280
You know, the slogan I keep saying, Dasein is its world existingly, is there.

632
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:13,320
Okay, now we're going to do two new stages.

633
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:23,800
One, Dasein is not an isolated, self-subsistent, independent entity because being with is an existentiale.

634
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,799
So now it's a whole new angle.

635
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:31,880
You can't have these private, self-subsistent, independent minds.

636
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:38,519
A human mind is already intrinsically bound up with there being other human beings.

637
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:42,440
That's being with, and that's what we're going to talk about in a minute.

638
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:48,039
And then the last one, my really favorite, well, I don't know, I have so many favorites here.

639
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,479
But I want to.

640
00:58:54,679 --> 00:59:07,440
The final coup de grace, where he's going to destroy the whole thing that the tradition has, is that it's the mind and the ego and the subject are not the source of meaning and intelligibility.

641
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:16,320
That's even you could say individual Gaussines are not the source of meaning and intelligibility.

642
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:21,120
And yet there has to be some source of meaning and intelligibility.

643
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,720
What could it be?

644
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,920
Well, I'm not going to tell you.

645
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,239
You try to figure it out because we're not going to get there until next time on that one.

646
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:32,800
But that's the fascinating one.

647
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:37,519
Where does the intelligibility of us and the world come from anyway?

648
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,880
And Heidegger's got a really interesting idea about that.

649
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,080
But now, back to the old problems, which I think are less interesting.

650
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:51,680
And I think he does too, because they don't get a whole big discussion like the last one.

651
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,360
But he's got, he wants to deal with the problem of other minds.

652
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:09,279
Once you get Descartes, you get problems that keep philosophy going and nobody ever solves, and it makes philosophy into a kind of normal science with a kind of booming business.

653
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:19,679
Heidegger gets really upset about this in a course that he's giving in 1923 or something called Ontology, what is it, the facticity?

654
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:22,400
The hermeneutics of facticity.

655
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,479
Anyway, and he talks about how all these other philosophers have problems.

656
01:00:26,479 --> 01:00:29,760
And then you get ahead and you get tenure by solving these problems.

657
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,999
And what you ought to do is, in effect, dissolve these problems.

658
01:00:33,999 --> 01:00:39,440
These are all problems that come only because you got the wrong phenomenological starting point.

659
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:53,399
And two of the best problems, and one that Berkeley used to be famous for spending its time worrying about, but the people who, the main person who worried about it has retired and isn't around anymore, and Tom Clark.

660
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,920
But that was the problem of the external world and skepticism.

661
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,199
It's the Barry Stroud carries on that to some extent.

662
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:06,120
So there is the problem of how we ever know anything about the external world.

663
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:09,319
There is the problem, and that keeps people busy.

664
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,759
It's a full-time job.

665
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:17,560
And Heidegger just sort of has fits and bones at the mouth when he thinks of all these colleagues getting ahead and getting tenure.

666
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:20,920
So we're trying to solve these non-existent problems.

667
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,999
You should dissolve them, not solve them.

668
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:25,159
And that he's just like Wittgenstein.

669
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:33,800
He thinks that the whole, and that's, and in that sense, Stroud is not in the issue.

670
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:40,120
He is not trying to solve the problem of the external world and solve and find the answer to skepticism.

671
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:49,400
Apparently, there were plenty of people doing that when I was a graduate student, and apparently it was a full-time industry when Heidegger was beginning teacher.

672
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,840
So what do you do?

673
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:53,400
Some light just go out?

674
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,079
I don't think so.

675
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:59,160
Anyway, so what's happening, really?

676
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:13,080
And to get people, we never should have been in the problem of other minds because we never had this special access to our mind, which was somehow our secret, private world of experience.

677
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:20,680
And then we have to know how we could ever get to know other people's private secret world of experience, or they could get to know ours.

678
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:24,680
It's another way to put it: it's the inner versus outer.

679
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:46,240
As soon as you think of Dasein as an inner, and they're sort of trying to get out, trying to transcend toward an outer, you've got the problem of the external world, which we'll get to later, but you've also got the problem of how any Dasein ever gets to know any other Dasein, and that's the one he happens to be starting with now.

680
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,079
So let's go over that.

681
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:55,360
So we were going to start now with these presuppositions that we just take for granted in philosophy.

682
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:59,039
This is one reason why you need to have 25B.

683
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:00,479
How many of you finally really have 20?

684
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:01,920
You have to have 25B.

685
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,440
I mean, you're supposed to, at least.

686
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,279
I'm not going to throw anybody out at this point.

687
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,239
It's too late.

688
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,279
You're on your own.

689
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,759
But anyway, that ought to help you understand this inner-outer thing.

690
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:23,920
I mean, all 25B, as far as I can imagine, as long as it's worrying about Hume and Kant and Leibniz and who else, Spinoza, and so forth, they've all got the inner-outer story.

691
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,880
And now Heidegger's going to try to get us out of it.

692
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:36,400
And so look on page, this is the beginning of section 25, page 150 in the German 114.

693
01:03:37,999 --> 01:03:41,600
And I've got to go a little bit into formal indication here, but not much.

694
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:49,599
The answer to the question of who Dasein is is one that is seemingly given in section 9, where we formally indicated the basic characteristics of Dasein.

695
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:58,479
Remember that was said that we will provisionally say that the essence of Dasein is that it's the being that takes a stand on its being.

696
01:03:58,479 --> 01:04:05,920
And we've said it provisionally, because we have to write all of being in time and show how it all hangs together to have the right to say that.

697
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:12,080
So he goes on, Dasein is an entity in which each case myself, its being is, in each case, mine.

698
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,159
This and then, let me, that's not really what I want to talk about.

699
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:17,719
So let's go skip a little.

700
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:23,160
The question of the who answers itself in terms of the I, the subject, the self.

701
01:04:23,479 --> 01:04:30,840
The who is what maintains itself as something identical through changes in its experiences.

702
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:34,440
And that must be Erlebnis with a capital E, I presume.

703
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,560
Did I ever say that there are two words for experience?

704
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:39,079
I think, didn't I, way back?

705
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:40,279
Or am I imagining it?

706
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,359
Erleubnis and Erfarung?

707
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,080
No, well, I better say that because it's very important.

708
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:48,440
There's a normal word for experience.

709
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,400
I mean, I don't.

710
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,920
Is that wrong?

711
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,280
That's right?

712
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,079
Great.

713
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:00,759
Okay, and that's some people call, say, objective experience.

714
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,920
Maybe I don't like that because I think, how about everyday experience?

715
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:11,400
So it's like, well, how was the experience in Philosophy 185 today?

716
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,159
Or, well, or, you know, whatever.

717
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:25,160
All just a kind of normal use of experience in which it's a public shared thing that everybody can experience.

718
01:05:25,479 --> 01:05:33,640
And then there is Erlebnis, which is a term that Husserl, as far as I know, brings in, that probably is around in German already.

719
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:39,319
And that's something like private experience.

720
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,999
I mean, there isn't any such thing, so it's hard to explain it to you.

721
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:48,999
But if you have 25B, you've had lots of people who believed it.

722
01:05:48,999 --> 01:06:05,679
Erlebnitz means each person has their own private stream of experience, their stream of what Kant called inner sense, and what Joyce was trying to write about, what's going on privately in Bloom's mind all the time.

723
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,599
What does that used to be called?

724
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,479
The flow, there's a word for that.

725
01:06:10,479 --> 01:06:13,039
Inner stream of consciousness.

726
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,680
Yeah, the people who write stream of consciousness though are writing about Erlebnis.

727
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:32,400
And Heidegger is saying that if you believe the Cartesian picture, then there is this identical something that holds together the changes in these experiences.

728
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:43,600
I'm pretty sure I'd be shocked if it isn't that this one is written in lowercase E, and this one is written in half of E in the translation.

729
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,760
So keep your eye open for that.

730
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,119
It's the other way around, right?

731
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:47,759
I just got it.

732
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,840
Didn't I get it reversed just now?

733
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,319
I don't know.

734
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,759
We'd have to look at the footnote.

735
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,840
When he first introduces it, I don't know.

736
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,920
Now I don't know where the footnote is either.

737
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,760
So unless we have to, we have to go look, because I can't leave you confused.

738
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:11,200
So we have to look in the German under Erlebnis, and then we'll find out in the footnote what's going on.

739
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,519
Erleben, Erlebnis, footnote on page Heidegger 46.

740
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:24,880
Okay, let's go to Heidegger 46.

741
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:28,319
You can't find your way through the book without it.

742
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:37,840
Okay, here at the bottom of seventy-two, Erlebnis, and so forth.

743
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:43,999
The connection between Leibniz and Erlebnis, oh, capital E, I guess I have it, is lost in translation.

744
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:50,039
And Erlebnis is not just any experience, which is Erfarung, but one which we feel deeply and live through.

745
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:51,800
The live through is the important thing.

746
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:54,840
That you could say in German, Dasfahn Erlebnis.

747
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:00,439
That means, wow, was that a moving private experience?

748
01:08:00,439 --> 01:08:09,159
We shall translate Erlebnis and Erleben by capital E and reserving small E for experience for Erfarung.

749
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:10,119
Did I do it right?

750
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:16,039
So there's so yeah, he's going to use a small E for this and a capital E for that.

751
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:17,159
Okay.

752
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,399
Now I can go back to where I was.

753
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:31,479
So there's this whole wrong view on 150 again that there is this private ego or self or subject and it has in it this stream of experience and it holds them all together, the unity of the stream of experience.

754
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:41,159
People from 25D again know the people like Kant and Hume were all worried about how it is that the subject unifies its stream of experience.

755
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:46,119
All this is just a big misunderstanding of the phenomena, Heidegger says.

756
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:53,319
But he's still going on with this, what he says, the who maintains itself as identical through changes in experiences.

757
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:54,199
It's a substance.

758
01:08:54,199 --> 01:09:05,399
It's self-contained and it's identical through all of the changes and through ways of behavior which relate and which relates itself to this changing multiplicity in so doing.

759
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:06,840
That's the s subject.

760
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:14,359
Ontologically we understand it as something which is in each case already constantly present at hand, both in and for a closed realm.

761
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,880
You see that's the inner, which lies at the basis.

762
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,239
In a very special sense, it is the subjectum.

763
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:25,960
That literally means that which underlies.

764
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,479
But don't get it confused with all this talk about underlies earlier.

765
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,960
Here, the subject underlies its properties.

766
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:41,999
So, the special subject is like a substance which underlies all the mental states that it has and holds together.

767
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,960
And that's it.

768
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:51,519
Okay, now, so you have to go back to the phenomena now and try to find a way out of this.

769
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,679
That's what he's talking about at the top of 151.

770
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:25,039
If in arriving at ontico-ontological assertions, one is to exhibit the phenomena in terms of the kind of being which the entities themselves possess, and if this way of exhibiting is to retain its priority over even the most usual and obvious answers and over whatever ways of formulating problems have been derived from those answers, then the phenomenological interpretation of Dasein must be defended against the perversion of our problematic when we come to the questions we're about to formulate.

771
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:35,760
That is, don't think that there's anything important about these private experiences of the I.

772
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:44,399
Then comes a murky paragraph on 151, which I don't think you should worry about, in which he's trying to give some place to poor old Husserl.

773
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:51,439
And he says, well, there must be some place for what he calls at the end, in quotes, a formal phenomenology of consciousness.

774
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:57,359
And what that's going to have to be is some kind of derivative innerness.

775
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:00,479
Sometimes you do have inner experiences.

776
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:07,920
And on reflection, you can contemplate your feelings or your moods or your thoughts and so forth.

777
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:16,519
And if you do that kind of reflecting, you can get this sort of derivative inner domain, he says.

778
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,599
And that's what Husserl thinks it's all about.

779
01:11:15,999 --> 01:11:21,079
That's what Husserl does in his phenomenology.

780
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:24,760
But that's exactly what's not what he wants to do.

781
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:34,999
He says in the next paragraph there, this kind of giving which we have is a mere formal reflective awareness of the I, and perhaps what it gives is indeed evidence and so forth.

782
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,719
But that's not what he's interested in.

783
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:40,519
He wants to question all of that.

784
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:50,599
Now it's very clear what I'm saying in the next paragraph, where he does it, this is the bottom of 115, second sentence in the bottom paragraph.

785
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:59,159
Is it then obvious a priori that access to Dasein must be gained only by mere reflective analysis of the I of acts?

786
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,119
Acts are not actions.

787
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:04,679
Actions are public things, so it's bad translation.

788
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,639
I mean, actions are things like standing up here and lecturing or walking across the street.

789
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:17,319
Acts is a technical term made up by Husserl to describe what, in Searle language, are mental states.

790
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:25,479
Acts are our thinking and seeing and everything that's supposedly going on inside.

791
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:34,840
And he wants to say, is that the best thing to do to start with these intentional states, these acts?

792
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,880
And he says, and this is the crucial rhetorical question.

793
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:46,199
What if this kind of giving itself on the part of Dasein should lead our existential analytic astray and in a manner grounded in the being of Dasein itself?

794
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:51,559
Well, I don't, I'm not sure he ever explains very well why it's grounded in Dasein itself.

795
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,519
You might want to keep your eye open and see if you can find out.

796
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,479
I never have.

797
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:01,960
Somehow, Dasein has a tendency to treat itself as a substance, as a subject, as an ego.

798
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:16,639
I doubt it, because there was a long period of time in the history of the world, in the history of the West, for sure, where Daseine did not treat itself as an ego, a subject with inner experiences at all.

799
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:32,239
I will tell you this story because it helps you realize how hard it was to con us into thinking that we've got this inner stream of consciousness and that we can, that we find on reflection, and it was there all along, and that's really what we are, and so forth.

800
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,719
I'll tell you the following story.

801
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,039
I don't think I've told it here, although I told it in office hours a few times.

802
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:46,079
If you can keep your eye open for this, you can see how gradually people came to think that they had an inner.

803
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:50,880
It starts, I'm sure there's a lot more to say about it, probably a book to say about it.

804
01:13:50,880 --> 01:14:01,920
But I noticed it first in Homer when at one point Homer says about Odysseus, who was at a big fancy dinner party, as they all are most of the time when they're not fighting.

805
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,800
And he's hearing the stories of the times when they were fighting, which is what they did at the dinner party.

806
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,720
It was a nice culture.

807
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,479
It was all very integrated.

808
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:23,999
And Homer says Odysseus was sitting there and he was crying inwardly, but he had this special trick that he could cry inwardly and his eyes remained dry as bone.

809
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:30,239
That is, he could actually feel emotions without publicly emoting.

810
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:37,359
And only Odysseus could do it, because he was so extremely clever that he could do tricks that nobody else could do.

811
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:39,999
So there's the first instance I know of the inner.

812
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:48,519
The next one that's really dramatic is Augustine in his confessions, who says that people came from miles around to watch St.

813
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:52,279
Jerome reading the Bible.

814
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,639
And the question is: what was so fascinating about Saint Jerome reading the Bible?

815
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,399
You will never imagine.

816
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:01,800
He was not moving his lips.

817
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,960
He was not making any noise.

818
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,039
He was not reading out loud.

819
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:13,159
He was doing something inner, Augustine said, in which the meaning of the text went directly to inside his mind.

820
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:15,720
And people didn't know how to read out loud.

821
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:23,319
And they didn't think of this as a kind of private event, reading and getting the meaning into your mind.

822
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:31,559
But we, and Augustine also, Augustine is very busy trying to make us aware of the inner.

823
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:40,920
He talks about afterimages at some point where you think you see something in the world, something on the wall after you stared at something else, but it's really not on the wall.

824
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,880
Where is it then?

825
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,960
Well, it must be in your mind.

826
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:49,559
I mean, later, I think Heidegger's going to say, no, no, it's over there by the wall in lived space.

827
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:56,119
It isn't over there by the wall in physical space, but we're not talking about physical space when we're talking about after images.

828
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:03,319
And then there's a whole complicated thing where Augustine tries to get you to realize that all your memories must be inside your mind.

829
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:06,920
And again, I think Heidegger's going to say, no, no, your memories are in the past.

830
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,439
You have access to the past.

831
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:19,960
It's not the past that went by with the last electrons, but it's the lived past is a long thing, and you're at a certain point in it, and you have access to the past and the future.

832
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:24,519
Anyway, so it took a long time to make a case for the inner.

833
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:40,559
And Heidegger's trying to say now: just you have to go back to the phenomena, and you have to realize this business that this idea that there's a self behind all of these inner experiences is what's going to lead us astray.

834
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,759
And one last sentence, summing up on 151, where it says 116 in the margin.

835
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:57,999
And what if the aforementioned approach, starting with the givenness of the I to Dasein and with a rather patent self-interpretation of Dasein, should lead the existential analytic, as it were, into a pitfall?

836
01:16:57,999 --> 01:17:00,559
And that's exactly right.

837
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,479
One more, I can't resist at the very bottom.

838
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,439
We have two minutes.

839
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:16,960
The word I is to be understood only in the sense of a non-committal formal indicator, indicating something that may perhaps reveal itself as its opposite in some particular phenomenological context of being.

840
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,279
That is, we don't know what the I is yet.

841
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:23,199
And we're not going to assume that it's this inner something.

842
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:29,199
Although we can start by saying it's what we think of now, given how we've been corrupted, as this inner something.

843
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:37,920
But formal indication, you start with what you got to indicate, and you're all thinking maybe, I hope, of your sort of inner world.

844
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:53,679
And then you indicate whatever that subject or that's the wrong word, whatever that Dasein is, let's indicate it, starting as what people have talked about as private stuff.

845
01:17:53,680 --> 01:18:08,239
But since you're doing it provisionally, that's what formal indication is, you should be ready to discover that the way you characteristics you thought you used in designating it turn out not to be really true of it.

846
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:12,399
And other characteristics that you didn't even notice turn out to be true.

847
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:20,439
That's what it will reveal itself as the opposite of in some in the in the everyday phenomenological context of what you thought of it.

848
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:28,999
And now that's enough to prepare us for the next section, being with, which we'll start with that next time.

849
01:18:28,999 --> 01:18:35,800
But go ahead and read now the part on the they too, because I'm going to get to the part on the they before the end next time.
