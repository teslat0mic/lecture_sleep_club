00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Okay, here we go.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,840
Back to understanding to begin with.

3
00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:15,080
I think, and I've never been clear at all about any of this, so if you see me sort of struggling and reading for my notes and repeating myself, it's because I'm still trying to get a grip on it.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,241
But I think I had a good grip on what we talked about last time.

5
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:27,320
I think that it's very important to sort out these two meanings of understanding, which is what we were doing last time.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:39,000
And there is, remember, a primordial understanding, and that brings in the for the sake of which, and we talked about that.

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,760
And then, but you can't take a stand on your own being, and that's understanding.

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,801
That's a kind of understanding, which you don't have to think about, but which you just understand what it is to be you.

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:03,000
That's the primordial kind, that's the ultimate for the sake of which kind of activity.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:16,681
But then there's, but you can't take a stand on what it is to be you except by using equipment, and that's what he calls the basic kind of understanding, or the primary kind of understanding.

11
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:20,921
And that's the one that I want to talk about today more.

12
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:30,440
We talked plenty about for the sake of which is and roles and all that last time, but we didn't go in far enough to the kind of basic understanding.

13
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,561
And I want to say one more general thing.

14
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:39,801
These two kinds of understanding have something interesting in common, which we did talk about.

15
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:42,281
Neither is aiming at a goal.

16
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:48,201
I can't aim at the goal of being a teacher, though I can aim at the goal of being a professor.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:58,481
And when I am coping in the most basic way of just being drawn in by affordances, which I'm going to talk about more, you don't have a goal either.

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,601
You just act.

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:13,041
You go through the two go in and out, and you lean on the and put your papers on the lecturing, and you do it, but not with a plan, a representation of the success conditions.

20
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:19,361
You just, if you've got familiarity with lecturins and doors and stuff, you just do it.

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:31,761
And remember, I keep saying Heidegger's example from basic problems is you go to the classroom, you use the door, and even more, you use the latch, the door handle, and you don't need to think about that.

22
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:32,960
And it isn't a goal.

23
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,001
It's just something that you can do.

24
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:40,321
You are what Heidegger calls pressing into possibilities.

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,561
Now we need to talk more about that.

26
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:45,761
But I also want to avoid something.

27
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,121
Listening to the last time I taught this, which is what I always do, which is, I know is considered weird by everybody else, but I can't help it.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,761
I have to find out what worked and what didn't.

29
00:02:55,761 --> 00:03:12,401
Well, what didn't work and wasted an hour was arguing about on page 186 what in the world Heidegger means by the difference between genuine and non-genuine understanding, since he never explains it except in that paragraph.

30
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,041
And I don't know anywhere in any of the other books from his lectures where he explains it either.

31
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:22,801
And since I don't know what it means, and it doesn't seem to make any difference anywhere else, we're just going to ignore it.

32
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:26,080
If anybody wants to bring it up in office hours, I do have an idea.

33
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:30,401
I have a whole interpretation of what it means in my commentary, but it's just made up.

34
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,200
I mean, I have no text to back up this.

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,600
I just, I just, if I had to fill in those words, I could tell you what I'd say, but I'm not going to tell you what I'd say because it isn't important.

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,961
So that gets us to where we want to be.

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:59,401
In the background from now on of what I'm going to say today is that we want to understand understanding in such a way that we can understand the move from understanding to interpretation.

38
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:10,520
And there is, I guess, three, or two or three, I don't know which interesting, important, difficult issues involved in that.

39
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:20,601
To begin with, understanding can be thought of as preconceptual and interpretation as conceptual.

40
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,761
And that's a big issue.

41
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:39,961
If any of you have had McDowell or any sort of current stuff in philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, that and what and Heidegger has a very interesting and a very sophisticated view of what the preconceptual is and how you get from there to the conceptual.

42
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:53,801
And that is, how do you get from just letting yourself be drawn into the affordances to dealing with entities as entities?

43
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:58,360
That means dealing with them as substances, with properties.

44
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:02,761
And how do you get from there to logic?

45
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,481
So it's not going to be done until next time.

46
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:18,521
But a fascinating issue that nobody has anything interesting to say about, except maybe Sam Totis, who I mentioned and whose views about it, though he sees the problem, his answer is pretty implausible.

47
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:23,561
So nobody's got anything interesting to say about a very interesting question.

48
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:36,241
If our basic way of relating to things is preconceptual, it's just dealing, period, how can you get to explain?

49
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:59,121
And if, of course, we have conceptual ways of relating to things and logic and we deal with substances with properties, what's the relation between this primordial kind, not primordial, primary kind of pressing into possibilities, which is basic for us having a world at all, our ability to think.

50
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,960
That is, to encounter substances and study their properties and their aspects.

51
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,481
I'll talk more about that.

52
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,921
And this is what's happening in this chapter.

53
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:19,761
Heidegger's going from a most basic way of being in the world that people have and that most people, most philosophers have never even glimmered.

54
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:27,841
And even now, people like McDowell, whom I'm arguing with all the time in the literature, haven't even glimmered yet.

55
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,241
Heidegger's going from this most basic kind of coping.

56
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:38,001
The only person who's got it and understood it is Marilla Ponty, as interpreted by Sean Kelly.

57
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:49,361
But I mean, they go from this very basic kind of interpreting, sorry, not interpreting, coping, to the most formal kind of logic.

58
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,480
How do you get there?

59
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,561
Well, this is a story about how you get there.

60
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,600
In this, what I'm going to talk about today are the steps.

61
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm not going to get to logic, I don't think, but are the steps by which our experience gets converted from transparent coping to thinking.

62
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:22,681
And the object of our experience gets converted from letting yourself be drawn in by affordances to thinking about substances and their properties.

63
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:36,440
And it's about how you get change from a dozen who is transparently coping pretty much like an animal, although there are distinctions, which, again, I'd be glad to talk about in office hours, but not here.

64
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:47,320
For us, it looks pretty much like you go from being this open head turned toward the world to being something like a subject.

65
00:07:47,320 --> 00:08:02,440
Of course, you're never completely a subject in the Cartesian sense because you're never completely self-contained and autonomous, but you at least you think, you have ideas, you have feelings in you and moods when you're being weird.

66
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
You've got a mood that nobody else has.

67
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,641
It must be in you and not in the public atmosphere.

68
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,200
You've got your own skills.

69
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,001
And so, well, I don't, no, that's not part of you as a subject.

70
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:18,521
That's part of you as a Dasein at the basic level.

71
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:37,321
But anyway, there is some, I don't know how is the right way to characterize it, but there's something that you are when you're not just being drawn in by affordances, which is misunderstood as self-sufficient subject, but something there has to be brought out.

72
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,241
What do you become?

73
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,521
And how do you become it when you stop just being drawn in?

74
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:47,481
All that is in here in this important chapter.

75
00:08:47,720 --> 00:09:05,121
In such a big, in such a mess because of the two meanings of understanding which I told you last time in a third one which I found when I went through it again today, which I'll mention later, doesn't radically change things.

76
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,241
But that's so that's one of the big questions.

77
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:17,761
In effect, how we get from Dasein being in the world to something like subjects thinking about something like substances.

78
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:25,601
And or how do we get from affordance relation to objects to thinking with concepts about them?

79
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:34,960
And then there's another whole issue which I've been fighting with my TAs for years, and now I think I know the answer, about which Heidegger, I think, always got it right.

80
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,321
It's just that it's subtle, and Heidegger doesn't unfortunately say it clearly enough.

81
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,161
But the question is, is about the as structure.

82
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:51,601
And we're going to talk about how, when you're responding to affordances, you're not even responding to them as affordances.

83
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,841
You're just responding.

84
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:57,840
Then interpretation brings in the as structure.

85
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm going to die I just blurt it out now, but I'll read passages and say m say more about it in a minute.

86
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:15,360
But the question is, Heidegger says, you know, that the the as structure is a basic feature of the world.

87
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:38,761
And that makes it sound like the as structure, so to speak, goes all the way down, that there's nothing more than than tables, which are things that I'm not even thinking, the stuff which we experience as a table and the stuff we experience the th the the whatever we experience as a door, and so forth, that that's what they're that's what the world is made up of.

88
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:44,600
Stuff that affords things, and you see it as affording things.

89
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,400
That's one version.

90
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,720
But I think that's wrong.

91
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:53,080
I think the as structure, well, it's half right.

92
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,080
I'll tell you what the answer is because then you could keep your head where we're heading.

93
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,640
The reason everything is so confused is there are two perspectives.

94
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,720
From the point of view of somebody watching me go out the door, they can say I'm using the door as a door.

95
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,920
That would be right.

96
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,360
And that's what it is.

97
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,080
It's a door.

98
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,201
And what am I doing with it?

99
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:14,521
I'm treating it as a door.

100
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:16,281
I'm seeing it as a door.

101
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,041
I'm using it as a door.

102
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,721
That's what somebody watching me can rightly say.

103
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:33,160
But when I'm experiencing it, you should get used to this now, and just being drawn out to go out, just being drawn to go out, I'm not experiencing it as a door.

104
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm not even experiencing it as drawing me to go out.

105
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:42,680
I'm just letting myself be drawn to go out.

106
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,200
And that's it.

107
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:52,521
So the reason, so what the fight between me and the TAs has always been, I was always saying the as structure doesn't go all the way down.

108
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:56,360
And they were saying, yes, everything that shows up shows up as something.

109
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,160
And the answer is right.

110
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,721
Both.

111
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:03,080
If it's in the business of showing up, it's showing up as something.

112
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:10,840
But when it's in the business of just being coped with, then it doesn't show up as anything.

113
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,200
It doesn't show up at all.

114
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,320
And both of those stories are right.

115
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,481
Now, well, maybe it's a time to pause just to make sure, but that's only supposed to be an overture.

116
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:30,080
I mean, I haven't argued anything or cited any passages, but if you're lost already or have something to say already, this is the time to do it.

117
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,360
Yeah.

118
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:40,160
The world shows up but not with an as structure.

119
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,840
Ah, good question.

120
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:50,320
I my first impulse is to say, well, no, my impulse is to be confused, so let me think a little longer.

121
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:56,721
What pulls me in one I my first impulse is to say, no, no, I mean, gee, you're not confused.

122
00:12:56,721 --> 00:13:01,041
I mean, my first impulse is to say the world always shows up as an as structure.

123
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:07,120
What else could it show up, show up as, except having things with functions and so forth?

124
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,721
It certainly doesn't show up as brute facts the way John Searle thinks it does and and then Descartes and so forth.

125
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:18,880
So then you might think, well, the world always shows up as having an as structure.

126
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,640
It's and but we show you this is ambiguous.

127
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,721
Whoa, already it's confusing.

128
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,200
Shows up to somebody looking at it from the outside, not absorbed.

129
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:33,440
But if it but when you're absorbed, then it doesn't seem to show up with an as structure.

130
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:35,360
But now you're asking a third question.

131
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,881
And when you're not absorbed, could it ever show up without an as structure?

132
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,801
That's what you just asked, I think.

133
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:46,160
And uh it may have to do with anxiety or breakdown.

134
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,840
You can do it with the wor with the workshop.

135
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,281
You don't need anxiety, which is just all super breakdown.

136
00:13:51,281 --> 00:14:03,680
Well, when remember when the tool is broken, then the workshop, the world, the little mini world of the workshop, shows itself.

137
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,761
But I guess it shows itself as lacking the equipment you need.

138
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,360
I think things always as, but I think it's worth trying to figure it out.

139
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:22,521
Okay, I'm going to go on, and now I say here in my notes, let's look in bold type.

140
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:37,880
Well, when you've got problems like the two I just talked about, how you get from absorption to concepts, and whether the as structure goes all the way down, there's nothing else to do but go back to the phenomenon, which is just what Heidegger would say to do.

141
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,600
Now, I take it that that's what he's doing on 189.

142
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,200
But I also say that I wanted to say something about 188, so let's talk about that.

143
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,840
Well, that's part of the puzzle.

144
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,041
So let's go back there.

145
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:13,320
We need a lot of explaining right at the beginning of the part on understanding and interpretation, starting about four lines down in number, in section 32.

146
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:20,761
The projecting of the understanding has its own possibility, that of developing itself.

147
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:28,920
This development of the understanding we call interpretation, in it, the understanding appropriates understandingly that which is understood by it.

148
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:35,240
Now, that sounds like there's some change when you go from understanding to interpretation.

149
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:41,241
But then he says, in interpretation, understanding does not become something different, it becomes itself.

150
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:45,400
Such interpretation is grounded existentially in understanding.

151
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,281
The latter does not arise from the former.

152
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:54,480
That is, you can't get understanding isn't sort of what you get when you've done some interpreting.

153
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:59,201
Interpreting is what you can do when you've already done some understanding.

154
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:04,400
And it's clear that whatever understanding is, it's more basic than interpretation.

155
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
That's part of his plane.

156
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:14,640
And it's unclear, boy, is it unclear, how the understanding does not become something different, it becomes itself.

157
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,960
But how it does that, but it's also somehow the precondition of interpretation.

158
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:30,801
And how can it be both the precondition of interpretation and become itself in interpretation?

159
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,641
It seems very puzzling.

160
00:16:32,880 --> 00:17:02,241
What you want to do, we haven't done it yet, but I keep saying it, is separate as much as possible the phenomenon of understanding, which is this primary kind, the phenomenon of interpretation, so that you can do it and do it in a way so that you can make sense of the fact that interpretation is somehow the working out of the understanding, and yet, period.

161
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,041
That's right.

162
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:16,241
Okay, yes, that it somehow grows out of the understanding, but it does it in a way that it preserves the understanding aspect of the understanding somehow.

163
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:18,241
Yeah, if you look puzzled, that's all right.

164
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:24,160
He begins, I think, with a big puzzle on 188 there.

165
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,400
But then I was going to go to 189, where he starts sort of telling us more about the phenomenon.

166
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,360
So let's look now at 189.

167
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:49,161
In the German, we're at the bottom of 148, and it says to say about the second sentence of the, well, we might as well begin that paragraph.

168
00:17:49,160 --> 00:18:07,160
In terms of the significance which is disclosed in understanding the world, concernful being emits the ready-to-hand, gives itself to understand whatever involvement that which is encountered can have.

169
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,401
Well, that's keep thinking about a door.

170
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,080
So somehow what's disclosed is something is disclosed as a door.

171
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:23,320
And now, but we don't know whether that means that you just use it to go out or that you see it as a door.

172
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,920
He hasn't settled that yet.

173
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:32,761
To say that circumspection discovers means that the world, which has already been understood, comes to be interpreted.

174
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:36,521
Okay, it looks, I just want to keep stressing this because this is my side.

175
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:40,360
It looks like something could be understood and not interpreted.

176
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,281
That is, so interpretation does not go all the way down.

177
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,921
That's how so many people miss that.

178
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:52,600
So the ready, and it's a what's already been understood comes to be interpreted.

179
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,880
Think about the door.

180
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:02,600
What's already been understood in the sense that it's the two go out, and when it's to when you're going somewhere, it draws you to go out.

181
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,361
It comes to be interpreted.

182
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,640
And what does that mean?

183
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:12,840
Well, he says the ready to hand, that's the door, comes explicitly into the sight which understands.

184
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:28,000
See, I think that already means what was already a door, which on reflection or when you observe it, you see as a door, can come into the coping, the ready-to-hand.

185
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:43,521
But if it comes into the coping as a door, which it can, then when you're studying it or when there's something wrong with it, then it comes explicitly into a sight which understands.

186
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,360
That's not obscure.

187
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,400
You can, instead of just going out the door, pay attention to the door.

188
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,680
I mean, he's not denying it.

189
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,561
He's not crazy.

190
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:54,640
You can go out the door as a door.

191
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,000
You can respond to affordances as affordances.

192
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:01,440
And when you do, you're at the level of interpretation.

193
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:07,120
It's when what you're doing becomes explicit.

194
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:10,481
And then immediately he explains it.

195
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,920
And this is the phenomenon.

196
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,920
All preparing, putting to rights, repairing, improving, rounding out are accomplished in the following way.

197
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:27,360
We take a part, and it's in order to, that which is circumspectively ready to hand, and we concern ourselves with it in accordance with what becomes visible through this process.

198
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:34,480
So we get, I guess the simplest thing to say is we notice it.

199
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:42,561
When it becomes explicit to a sight which understands, and it becomes visible, that means we notice it.

200
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:47,281
It's invisible when we're just, the doorknob, for instance, is invisible.

201
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:49,600
It isn't in a sight which understands.

202
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,920
And it isn't explicit when we're just going through the door in affordance way.

203
00:20:55,921 --> 00:21:06,640
But if the doorknob sticks, or if the doorknob is the wrong kind, we're used to round kinds, but this is the straight kind and we haven't ever seen one before or something, then we can notice it.

204
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,240
Then it comes into the sight which understands.

205
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:12,600
That's what he's going to call interpretation.

206
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,561
So let's go on.

207
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:23,080
That which has been circumspectively taken apart with regard to its inordered to and taken apart as such, that which is explicitly understood has the structure of something as something.

208
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,801
Okay, as soon as you notice it, you notice it as something.

209
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:38,920
The circumspective question as to what this particular thing that is ready to hand may be receives the circumspectively interpretive answer that it is for such and such a purpose.

210
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,760
That's now, that's the phenomenon.

211
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,201
It's not all that mysterious.

212
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:52,201
It's just hard to sort it out because they are all these phenomena that are very sort of close to each other.

213
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
I'm going to skip a little and go on then.

214
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:05,640
That which is disclosing understanding, that which is understood, is already accessible in such a way that its as which can be made to stand out explicitly.

215
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:14,201
That means, in my talk, that it's already got an inorder to, a function.

216
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:25,960
It's already, and that, and we're responding to that function as we get pulled out in being drawn to go out, as I keep saying.

217
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:29,160
And that can be made explicit.

218
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,080
And that's, again, then it's seen as a door.

219
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,480
The as makes up the structure of the explicitness of something that is understood.

220
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,960
It constitutes the interpretation.

221
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:42,440
And that's where he introduces.

222
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:47,640
So interpretation, explicit, noticed, all go together.

223
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:56,480
In dealing with what is environmental ready to hand, by interpreting it circumspectively, we see it as a table, a door, a carriage, or a bridge.

224
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,401
Notice that.

225
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:08,001
It doesn't say in dealing with what is environmentally ready to hand, period, we see it as a table.

226
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:10,160
It's important to get it straight.

227
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:21,761
In dealing with what is environmentally ready to hand by interpreting it circumspectively, circumspectively doesn't help much because either you do understanding circumspectively too.

228
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:25,680
Circumspectively means you're taking account of the context.

229
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:38,561
Even when you go out the door in your most understanding way, that is just drawn out the door, you take account of the doorknob, otherwise you couldn't turn it and get out.

230
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:43,920
And so this basic taking account, which isn't noticing, which is, it's invisible.

231
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,480
It's just that your skill meshes with the familiarity.

232
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:50,801
But circumspection is always there.

233
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:55,281
I mean, it's the way you take account of the familiarity and the situation.

234
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:59,200
But when you do the circumspection, how does it say this here?

235
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:01,281
I'm just going to find it again.

236
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:04,640
I've lost it already.

237
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:15,601
In dealing with what is environmentally ready to hand by interpreting it circumspectively, then you see it as a table, a door, a carriage, or a bridge.

238
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,840
He's not saying that that's what you always do.

239
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:30,801
I'm constantly fighting off about five or ten generations of TAs who think this sentence says, or PhDs, who think this sentence says, well, whenever you're dealing with anything, you see it as something.

240
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:32,561
I think that's wrong.

241
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:41,880
So, skipping down a little more, any mere pre-predicated seeing of the ready-to-hand is in itself something which already understands and interprets.

242
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:43,480
Now, that's complicated.

243
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:57,721
That's because, I think, that there is something where predicative sounds like substances with properties, or bringing it under the concept door.

244
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:15,880
And he's saying, well, there's a kind of seeing of the ready-to-hand which understands and interprets, which is pre-predicative, not substance with properties, and pre-conceptual, and so forth.

245
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:22,201
Well, that would be a big headache if it weren't that he's already told you exactly what that is.

246
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,241
Do you recognize that?

247
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:34,360
Does anybody recognize what it would be like to see something as something, but not see it as a substance with properties, with context-free properties?

248
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,680
How about seeing it as something with contextual, something or others?

249
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:42,200
Aspects, does that ring any bell with anybody?

250
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,720
What about the hammer that's too heavy?

251
00:25:45,721 --> 00:26:02,281
Seeing the hammer, experiencing the hammer as too heavy, is a pre-predicative form of, if I understand it right, interpretation, because it's already experiencing it as too heavy.

252
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:03,801
That's what we're talking about.

253
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:06,601
Or I'm experiencing that the hammer is too heavy.

254
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,121
It's already, as the analytic people would be important, find important to say, propositional.

255
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:15,080
I experience that the hammer is too heavy.

256
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,320
I don't experience the bang of anything when the hammering is going well.

257
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,761
So there is a, so there is basic understanding.

258
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:26,640
It isn't predicative for sure.

259
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:30,240
That is, I'm certainly not understanding the hammer weighs five pounds.

260
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:34,880
It's not even pre-predicative if the hammer isn't too heavy.

261
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:43,440
But if the hammer is too heavy, then you pay attention, notice, you see it, all that talk.

262
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:52,720
And so he goes on: any near pre-predicative seeing of the ready-to-hand is in itself something which already understands and interprets.

263
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:56,241
Yes, which doesn't mean that every time you understand, you interpret.

264
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,761
That's the mistake.

265
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,841
But does not the absence of such an as make up the nearness of any pure perception of something?

266
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:09,120
Whenever we see with this kind of sight, we already do so understandingly and interpretively.

267
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,801
That's the same thing.

268
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:18,961
I don't want to read further, but except to myself to see that I haven't left anything out.

269
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,481
Well, that's a hard one at the bottom.

270
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,921
I wasn't going to talk about it, but I feel I have to.

271
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:48,080
In the mere encountering of something, it is understood in terms of a totality of involvements.

272
00:27:48,080 --> 00:28:09,801
I take that to mean that you understood, when you understand the door as to go out, or the table as to put the lectern on, your familiarity and your skillful coping already has in it, so to speak, an understanding of the referential totality.

273
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:18,041
That is, you understand that the door leads to the floor and the floor supports you and all that, and you don't think any of that.

274
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:30,681
But you, because you've got this familiarity, which you've developed all from since you were a kid, of all this stuff, which all is interrelated, the table, the chair, the lectern, the lights, the blackboard, and so forth.

275
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:48,360
When I, even when I transparently, that is unreflectively, unnoticingly, but because my mind is on what I'm trying to teach, I'm writing something on the blackboard, my understanding is already taking, see, now you've got to be careful.

276
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:57,640
I mean, you can say my understanding is already taking account of the blackboard as part of the referential totality, but you've got to be very careful there.

277
00:28:58,441 --> 00:29:05,481
You don't mean that that's part of your, that you have to think about that or notice it or anything like that.

278
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:16,921
It's just, like circumspection at the bottom level, part of what, part of the way your familiarity is always right there in your absorbed coping.

279
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:22,120
I mean, if things lead you to respond in such and such a skillful way, let's change to my other example.

280
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:36,120
If when it's hot in the room, you're just drawn to open the window, you already related to the window as part of the referential totality for getting fresh air into something called rooms where people go and sit and breathe and so forth.

281
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,641
But none of that needs to be in any way in your mind.

282
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:54,321
It's just what I'm calling in other places a myth of the mental to say, well, then you've got to judge that it's a window and judge that it's for fresh air and remember that it'll cool down the room.

283
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:54,960
Of course not.

284
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,241
None of that.

285
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,041
Is that all right?

286
00:29:53,321 --> 00:30:00,320
I mean, people are looking a little dazed for some reason.

287
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:01,441
You're looking dazed.

288
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:01,600
Yeah.

289
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:02,800
Go ahead first.

290
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,200
Yeah.

291
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,801
Yeah, well, let me say yes and no.

292
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,040
That is, no wonder you're puzzled.

293
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:44,400
Understanding can exist alone without interpretation, even though your skill and the affordances that your skill meshes with are already the skills that you develop so that the referential totality is built into the affordances.

294
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:46,161
But that's still understanding.

295
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:54,321
But then if you have an interpretation, that is, if you notice what you're doing, the understanding has got to be there already and stay there.

296
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:58,160
So you never get interpretation without understanding, answer you.

297
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,281
But you can have understanding without interpretation.

298
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:17,521
Before you say anything, Dave, I want to read something because he just said something that Heidegger was expecting him to say and answered on page 160 of his lecture course, The History of the Concept of Time.

299
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:19,120
No, it's not 160.

300
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,720
Okay, well, I don't find it.

301
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,521
How about 260?

302
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:25,361
Yes.

303
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:38,561
Well, it isn't quite right on, but it's very relevant.

304
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:46,200
Interpretation as such does not actually disclose, for that is what understanding itself takes care of.

305
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,960
See, that's relevant to what you're saying.

306
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:50,120
That's always got to be there.

307
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:58,441
Interpretation always only takes care of bringing out what is disclosed as a cultivation of the possibilities inherent in the understanding.

308
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:01,481
That means, you know, noticing it as a door.

309
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:12,600
You can do that, but it can't be disclosed as a door except on this bottom level of familiarity and coping, responding data.

310
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,481
Would there be in your view the frank thing?

311
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,720
Oh, in one way.

312
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:26,760
Well, good.

313
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,440
Well, that's a trick question.

314
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:41,161
I mean, that's the kind of question that causes years of argument between me and everybody else.

315
00:32:41,160 --> 00:33:09,401
So I want to say, and this is just apropos exactly of what we're talking about, you can have an I mean, let's, if understanding means noticing, you can, and seeing as, and thinking about it, so forth, any of that, then understanding, and if that stuff is what interpretation does, make explicit and notice, you can certainly have understanding without interpretation.

316
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:37,680
However, since your familiarity is familiarity with a world, and a world already has an ad structure all over it in the referential hole, doors are for going out and so forth, insofar as your skill meshes with the world, it's already got an implicit as structure, but you've got to be very careful.

317
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,801
That's what you're asking about.

318
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:58,001
Implicit as structure means, and this is the very tricky part, that you can get out of your absorption and notice what you're doing, and you'll discover that you're using the door as a door, and it already was a door, and it already had the function of going out.

319
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,041
That's fine.

320
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:14,321
But if you want to stick to what you're experiencing when you're going out at the basic level of understanding, then you're not experiencing this as stuff, you're just dealing with it, and it's drawing you to do the appropriate thing.

321
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:27,681
So the trick is, all around this business of explicitly, you make the, to make the as structure explicit could mean it's there in your experience already, but you haven't noticed it.

322
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,001
That's what I think is the wrong thing to say.

323
00:34:30,481 --> 00:34:32,000
Well, no, even that's not wrong.

324
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:38,320
It's there in what you're experiencing, namely the door.

325
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,161
But it's not there in your experience.

326
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,481
And you've got to be very careful, or you'll become a cognitivist.

327
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:48,640
It's a big, it's right on the horizon.

328
00:34:48,640 --> 00:35:08,160
If you think that what you figure out later or notice later, namely the as structure, is already there in some way implicitly, you've got to be very clear that you don't mean that it's that there is anything, well, what?

329
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,481
I don't know.

330
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:20,361
If I could put it any clearer, you don't mean that when you do notice the as structure of your experience, you notice what has been there all along.

331
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:26,600
What you notice is not the as structure of your experience, but your as structure of the world, which has been there all along.

332
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
And that's the implicit.

333
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,241
That's in your skill.

334
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:41,001
Your skill of just responding to the two go out has already is the skill it is because doors do what doors do.

335
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:48,920
And therefore, when you reflect, you can always make explicit that you were using the door as a door.

336
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,001
Is that any help?

337
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,680
It's very subtle.

338
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:59,720
It's interpreting, but it's not yet taking something apart.

339
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:09,001
Okay, well, as long as, but if you define interpreting as taking something as something, which he does, you can't have that.

340
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:31,080
Except that I'm trying to give justice to just your position, saying, but it's in the familiarity already, and you're acting out of your familiarity, and your familiarity is to, so to speak, you've been trained up in your culture, with doors and so forth, to treat doors as doors.

341
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,201
But that's, you know, well, but that's not what he's going to call interpretation, I think.

342
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:47,640
Because he's pretty clear that you can have understanding without interpretation in that passage I read from the concept of time, but you can't have interpretation without understanding.

343
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,041
If you want to put in a slogan, that's what I'm trying to say over and over and over.

344
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:59,441
That's why I knew exactly where it was in basic history concept of time because he's trying to say it over and over in his lectures.

345
00:36:59,441 --> 00:37:00,160
I see a hand.

346
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,441
Yeah, Tyler.

347
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:13,360
Uh-huh.

348
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:14,801
Well, that is serious.

349
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,401
If that's what he says, everything I've said for the last hour is wrong.

350
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,520
So let's look at it.

351
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:22,481
What page?

352
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,120
Oh, well, that's all very, very relevant.

353
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,961
So let's look at it.

354
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:38,080
He's talking about, let's start at the top of 200.

355
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,961
In German, we're at the middle of 157.

356
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,961
But to what extent does it become a derivative mode of interpretation?

357
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:47,760
Let's see, what have we modified in it, whatever that is?

358
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,680
We can point out the modification if we stick to certain limiting cases.

359
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,441
Oh, I don't know whether this is too far ahead.

360
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:54,561
Let's skip down.

361
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:56,961
The hammer is heavy, then so forth.

362
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:57,521
That's good.

363
00:37:57,521 --> 00:38:01,041
The thing, a hammer has the property of heaviness.

364
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:05,600
Well, of course, that's already different than to say it's too heavy.

365
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,800
Let me remind you: aspects are situational.

366
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,001
When the hammer is too heavy, it's too heavy for me at this time with this job.

367
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:19,120
It isn't when you put it on the shelf and see it just sitting there, too heavy.

368
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,040
That's not a property of the hammer.

369
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:24,241
That's something that comes out of our relation to the hammer.

370
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,600
However, if the hammer weighs five pounds, that's a property of the hammer.

371
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:36,241
No matter how strong or weak I am, whether the hammer's on the shelf or I'm hammering with it, it always weighs five pounds.

372
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:45,000
Properties just in here in substances, and they are not situational, but aspects like too heavy do.

373
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:47,561
Now, whether that's going to be important here, I don't know.

374
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:49,720
The hammer has the property of heaviness.

375
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,680
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

376
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:54,280
Now, where are we going to go, Tyler?

377
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:04,440
Interpretation is carried out primordially, not no, where oh, that's what I was just reading.

378
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:07,880
Okay, I'll read it because I could put it on the pod.

379
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:23,561
Interpretations is carried out primordially, not in a theoretical statement, but in an action of circumspective concern, laying aside the unsuitable tool or exchanging it without wasting words.

380
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,320
Huh, that's interesting.

381
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:36,360
Well, that suggests from the fact that words are absence, it may not be concluded that interpretation is accurate.

382
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,561
That's right.

383
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,921
The kind of interpretation which is expressed is not all in an assertion.

384
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:48,120
Interpretation.

385
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:55,240
See, I think, and what Tyler says, I think it's a question of the context here.

386
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:19,961
I think that he's talking about interpretation, and he's saying it's not theoretical there, but it's already situational, like too heavy, and you lay aside the unsuitable tool without wasting words, yes, but at that point, you're already no longer just pressing into the affordances.

387
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:34,641
You come into a problem, and he's trying to say the problem doesn't require reflection and it doesn't require assertions, which is what he's thinking about, but you can respond directly to the problem.

388
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:44,880
But as soon as you are responding to the hammer as too heavy, if that's part of your experience, then it's already interpretive.

389
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,561
That's how I'm going to read that.

390
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:49,600
When we get there, keep your eyes open when you get there.

391
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,641
See if you think that's right.

392
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,481
Okay, good problems.

393
00:40:56,961 --> 00:40:59,600
Now, back to this.

394
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,041
Where are we?

395
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:04,160
Oh, it's funny.

396
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:09,120
I've got a quote here on 189, which has to do with this pre-predicate.

397
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,080
Oh, that's what I just read.

398
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
It's the same, that's what we're talking about.

399
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,281
We've just done it.

400
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,481
So let me go on and look at my notes some more.

401
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:26,400
I say back here on 261, he says it again.

402
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,000
Let's see if that's helped.

403
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:35,360
Remember, of course, that the lectures are always interesting because he's always trying to say clearer what he's so.

404
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:41,361
Let's look at 261 at the top of 261 of the history of the concept of time for a minute.

405
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:45,281
I don't know what I'm going to get when I read this, but I marked it, so it must be important.

406
00:41:48,640 --> 00:42:00,001
Interpretation, I'm about five lines down and putting together some stuff, brings to prominence as what the encountered thing can be taken, how it is to be understood.

407
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:15,640
The primary form of all interpretation as the cultivation of understanding, that is, making something more out of understanding, is the consideration of something in terms of the as what, considering something as something.

408
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,680
Oh, we're back to that.

409
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:18,521
I don't think he's saying anything new there.

410
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:21,241
So maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.

411
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,801
Yeah, well, it doesn't hurt to repeat it, but we repeated it a dozen times.

412
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:30,521
So we're getting to where the as comes into it.

413
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:45,241
So I want to say, and I put it in here, but I have to put it someplace.

414
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:54,200
One of the problems is it hasn't really sort of perturbed this conversation, which is good, but it could, and you've got to, so I'll warn you.

415
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,640
Remember that understanding means two, or I think now three different things when Heidegger uses it.

416
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,080
I'll tell you the third one in a minute.

417
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,681
But let's just do the first two.

418
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:13,161
Understanding always has got in it the relation to the ultimate for the sake of which it's part of the familiarity.

419
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,361
And you can have that kind of understanding.

420
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:23,800
That is, I can be, it's because, I don't want to say as a teacher, that's not right.

421
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,120
It's because I am a teacher.

422
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:34,281
Remember, you design, I should say so this: the Dasein, remember, he says, in understanding is its possibilities.

423
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,481
So I am a teacher, and that's at the level of understanding.

424
00:43:39,481 --> 00:43:43,080
It doesn't require noticing anything or thinking about anything.

425
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,400
So, that both at the top, I'm just repeating something I said last time, but I think it's important.

426
00:43:47,800 --> 00:44:06,880
Something interesting that Heidegger's seen, that understanding at the highest level, primordial understanding of me as a teacher, which isn't something you can represent and aim for at all, because it's about a possibility that I am, not a possibility that I can achieve.

427
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:10,241
You never achieve being a teacher, you just are.

428
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,880
At the highest level, possibility is higher than actuality, he says, and you are your possibility.

429
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:22,641
It's clear for being a teacher, but it's also clear for responding to the affordance of going out the door.

430
00:44:24,481 --> 00:44:36,401
It isn't as if going out the door is the kind of possibility which will become, which you can represent as a goal and then achieve it.

431
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:41,041
At this basic level, you don't represent it as a goal and then achieve it.

432
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,441
You just are.

433
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:48,721
I mean, you're so absorbed in what you're doing, this is the way to put it, that you aren't even there.

434
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:51,120
You just are the going out the door.

435
00:44:51,120 --> 00:45:09,841
So, he sees at the both levels, that there's the highest and the lowest, that there's a sense in which you can be the possibility instead of it being something, instead of sort of waiting to the actuality, waiting to succeed at whatever.

436
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,361
If I could find it instantly, it's on 404.

437
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:16,881
What I'm saying is in here.

438
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:26,561
This has got something to do with not being a subject at the level of that he's interested in.

439
00:45:26,561 --> 00:45:31,201
Okay, this is a very interesting sentence in 405, just in the middle of nowhere.

440
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,321
Meet.

441
00:45:34,961 --> 00:45:48,521
Remember, I say that he's also interested in showing that at the basic level of coping, you are not a self or anything like a subject.

442
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:51,800
You just are the absorbed coping.

443
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:56,600
That sounds like a weird thing to say, but I'm sure he understands it and believes it.

444
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:13,721
The middle of 405, right sort of halfway into 354 in the German, the middle of 405, this funny paragraph, a specific kind of forgetting is essential for the temporality that's constitutive for letting something be involved.

445
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,800
The self must forget itself.

446
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:22,201
If lost in the world of equipment, it is to be able actually to go to work and manipulate something.

447
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:24,280
Now, that's fascinating.

448
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:32,841
And that just says if you're really coping, if you're really in flow, if you're really absorbed, you have to lose track.

449
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:34,040
There isn't any you.

450
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,441
There's just coping going on.

451
00:46:36,441 --> 00:46:40,200
And the more you're absorbed, the better the coping.

452
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:50,120
And if you really, as he says, if you, quote, actually go to work, that is, if you're really involved, you don't have a self.

453
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,760
So at that bottom level, you don't have the self.

454
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,241
So all I'm saying, why am I saying this?

455
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,841
I'm answering something.

456
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,201
Nobody remember?

457
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,000
Maybe if I look here, I'll know why I'm saying this.

458
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:16,041
Oh, well, yeah, I'm talking about the three meanings of understanding that I want to warn you about.

459
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,161
And I'm saying that there is this bottom level.

460
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:40,721
And oh, yeah, and I was just doing the parallel between the two kinds that we talked about last time: the primordial and the primary levels of understanding, that is, the for the sake of which kind and the just being drawn into it kind, are such that you just get completely absorbed.

461
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:45,840
You don't represent the situation and so forth.

462
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:47,120
You just do it.

463
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:53,681
I'm just doing my teacher thing, and I'm just doing my lecture and thing at the top level and the bottom level.

464
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,281
And I'm so absorbed there isn't even any special me monitoring what's going on.

465
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,160
But now, what I want to tell you is that there's a third kind, a third use of understanding.

466
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,561
No big deal, but just getting the language straight.

467
00:48:06,561 --> 00:48:09,361
It isn't a new phenomenon at all.

468
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:13,040
Okay, so there are three different ways he uses understanding.

469
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:16,001
Primordial existential structure.

470
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:17,201
That's the new one.

471
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,401
Then there's the primary one, which we just talked about.

472
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,041
But you have to go back now and do them in this new order.

473
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:32,401
Understanding is the name for primordial existential structure.

474
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:34,001
I'm going to give you a chart next time.

475
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:36,401
I promised it this time, but I didn't finish it.

476
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:41,041
But there is a level of these primordial existential structures.

477
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,161
What are they?

478
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:51,841
Well, there is disposedness, falling, or being absorbed, better say being absorbed, and understanding.

479
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:56,401
And those are, he calls them primordial existential structures.

480
00:48:56,401 --> 00:49:06,401
Well, he doesn't call them that, but he says the following quote, equiprimordial with disposingness and constituting this being is understanding on 182, right at the beginning.

481
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:10,681
So, no, not right at the beginning, but where on 182.

482
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:14,281
Must be in the right at the beginning of the understanding chapter.

483
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,120
Yeah, right, the first sentence of 31.

484
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:24,120
See, disposedness is one of the existential structures in which the being of the there maintains itself.

485
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,841
Equiprimordial with it in constituting this being is understanding.

486
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,320
Well, there's a funny use of equiprimordial.

487
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:35,561
It just means they are the basic structures of Dasein.

488
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,480
Remember, they always come in threes.

489
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:41,561
And I'm going to show you next time a lot of the various names for the threes.

490
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:53,161
But the important thing is that one of the ways of using understanding is that it's a structure, and we haven't filled in anything about that structure yet.

491
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,200
That's the new one.

492
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:03,080
I didn't realize that he's going to call understanding a primordial structure, but if he wants to, it's okay with me.

493
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:10,440
But then that primordial structure gets filled in, and that's primary understanding.

494
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:12,761
It gets realized.

495
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,321
That is, this primordial structure, how does it get realized?

496
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:18,841
By coping.

497
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:25,561
Just as the primordial structure of disposedness gets realized as what?

498
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:27,801
I just want to make sure you're awake.

499
00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:31,881
How does disposedness become concrete, as he puts it?

500
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:34,361
That's his word from I realize.

501
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,201
Oh, if nobody knows the answer to that, I'm going home.

502
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,961
It's just too depressing.

503
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:40,600
Come on.

504
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:47,481
How does disposedness get realized, get made concrete, actually come into your experience?

505
00:50:47,481 --> 00:50:53,281
It doesn't come in as some abstract, Heidegger fancy term, disposedness.

506
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,641
It's what?

507
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,401
No, not circumspection.

508
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,721
Come on.

509
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,600
Hmm?

510
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:59,920
Mood.

511
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,120
Who said that?

512
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,920
Some hero.

513
00:51:01,921 --> 00:51:07,840
Oh, I wish it was somebody else, Eugene, because I know you know this already.

514
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,040
Anyway, it's mood, of course.

515
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:13,761
Disposedness gets realized as mood.

516
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,160
It gets concrete as mood.

517
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,881
Now you can make the same parallel statement.

518
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:22,641
Understanding gets realized as coping.

519
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,760
It becomes concrete as coping or dealing.

520
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,481
Eugene has convinced me that I shouldn't say coping.

521
00:51:28,481 --> 00:51:32,241
I think I've admitted that, because it sounds like you're having a problem.

522
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,320
So let me say it in Heidegger's talk.

523
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,481
Understanding becomes concrete in coping.

524
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:41,920
So we've got this formal thing, which he calls primordial.

525
00:51:41,921 --> 00:51:42,881
I wish he didn't.

526
00:51:42,881 --> 00:51:45,120
Just an abstract notion, understanding.

527
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,561
And then it becomes concrete in coping.

528
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:57,841
And it becomes most fully manifest, I think, he would say, in the ultimate for the sake of which.

529
00:51:57,841 --> 00:51:59,440
Those are the two we already had.

530
00:51:59,441 --> 00:52:19,681
Those are the two ways that you can talk about the way this abstract structure called understanding, which hasn't got any content yet, can become primordially manifest in the experience of the ultimate for the sake of which, which is governing your life.

531
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,481
Well, not even the experience, just in the way the for the sake of which governs your life.

532
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:30,961
Or it can become realized in just going out the door, not as the door, but just to go out.

533
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:35,441
And either, but that's not the primordial way it gets realized.

534
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:41,800
That's what Heidegger is going to call the primary way, the everyday way, the common sense way, the pragmatic.

535
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,841
So there's something like primordial understanding and pragmatic understanding.

536
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:51,401
The primordial understanding gets realized in living your life as or whatever you are.

537
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:55,080
There's always in the way, just living your life, period.

538
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:01,240
And the primary kind gets realized just by doing things, which you're doing all the time.

539
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,441
Right now you're doing lots of things.

540
00:53:02,441 --> 00:53:10,761
You're sitting in the chair and you're staying awake, some of you, hopefully, and then you're taking notes and so forth.

541
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,721
That's the primary kind of understanding.

542
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,561
I saw a hand somewhere, I believe.

543
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:17,001
I just hallucinated.

544
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:17,480
Yeah.

545
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:27,080
Ah, well, I can only, I mean, good, but I thought I could help you with that by just your intuition.

546
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:35,001
If you've got some abstract notion, disposedness, then you want to know, well, what specifically would be a case of disposedness?

547
00:53:35,321 --> 00:53:43,481
And then somebody says, well, it gets concrete in moods, but it gets concrete in what, in specific moods.

548
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:47,480
It gets concrete in fear, say, or so forth.

549
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:51,161
I guess you force me to become clear about this.

550
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:57,801
To come concrete means you get an actual case of it.

551
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:05,001
You get this very abstract thing, and then you want to re see, well, what would it be like for this abstract thing to actually be happening?

552
00:54:05,001 --> 00:54:06,521
And same thing with understanding.

553
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:11,800
You get this very abstract thing, understanding, and that's just a word that Heidegger just introduces.

554
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:16,201
And you want to know, well, what would it be for something like understanding to actually be happening?

555
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,761
Then you get COVID.

556
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,961
Okay?

557
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:20,840
Okay.

558
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,521
I'm ready to go on.

559
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:23,481
Uh well.

560
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:39,840
Well, 184, I say, is where he switches to understanding is the realization of an existential structure like usability.

561
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,120
No, no, no, no.

562
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,961
Well, that doesn't.

563
00:54:46,961 --> 00:54:51,761
I mean, I mean, I'm sure it's in there, sort of, but I don't need it for what I'm going to do.

564
00:54:56,481 --> 00:55:01,761
Oh, and then this important line, I'm just sort of reviewing because I see important lines that I haven't said.

565
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,481
But I keep saying you don't have a goal.

566
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:12,161
They're just possibilities, and they never get actual when you're coping at either of these levels.

567
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,840
It's not a kind of surro-like intentionality.

568
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:20,401
Now, let's see, somewhere on 155, he just says that, and I figure I ought to say it.

569
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,481
Oh, look at this.

570
00:55:26,481 --> 00:55:28,320
A nice thing I didn't say either.

571
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:32,801
But let's find it first.

572
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:42,080
Well, there's the quote I talked about at the top of 185, which gets through the two kinds: the primordiality, Daisy, and so forth.

573
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,360
But that's not what I want right now.

574
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,800
Well, this is this crucial stuff.

575
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,441
I just explained this hard paragraph.

576
00:56:05,441 --> 00:56:07,520
So now I'll read the hard paragraph I explained.

577
00:56:07,521 --> 00:56:11,241
The bottom, the very middle of 185.

578
00:56:11,561 --> 00:56:13,161
I'm going to start reading.

579
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:17,000
This has all got to do with how you don't pay attention.

580
00:56:17,001 --> 00:56:18,920
Now the word is going to be thematized.

581
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:25,001
Furthermore, the character of understanding as projection is such that the understanding does not grasp thematically.

582
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:33,400
And only I've read this once before, that it shouldn't say upon which it projects.

583
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:35,801
It should say towards which it projects.

584
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,801
That is to say, possibilities.

585
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:46,041
Grasping in such a manner would take away from them as what take away from what is projected its very character as a possibility.

586
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:56,280
That is, you don't pay attention to them as possibilities, then you would just have something you had in your mind instead of being drawn into the affordance.

587
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,681
Projection in throwing throws before itself the possibility as possibility and lets it be as such.

588
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:08,120
That means, I think, you don't think about it as a possibility.

589
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:15,480
As projecting, understanding is the kind of being of Dasein in which it is its possibilities as possibilities.

590
00:57:15,481 --> 00:57:18,441
Ooh, ooh, why do I like, I don't like that.

591
00:57:18,441 --> 00:57:26,360
As projecting, understanding is the kind of being of Dasein, in which it is its possibility.

592
00:57:27,961 --> 00:57:30,361
Why as possibility?

593
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:33,800
I don't know what that adds.

594
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:39,160
Why shouldn't it say as projecting, understanding is the kind of being of Dasein in which it is its possibilities?

595
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,600
I certainly understand that.

596
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:47,080
That's when you're so absorbed in what you're doing that the self disappears, the passage I read.

597
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,080
What is it to be the possibilities?

598
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:54,800
That's good.

599
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,681
That's good.

600
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,481
I think that's right.

601
00:57:56,481 --> 00:57:59,760
It's not that you experience your possibilities as possibilities.

602
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,080
Good.

603
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,481
It has to be that, but that's what you really are.

604
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:05,840
All that's left of you is your absorbed flow.

605
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:06,721
I guess.

606
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,720
I mean, it would be nice to look at the German.

607
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,921
I suppose.

608
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:11,840
Good.

609
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:14,160
Eugene, where's our other German understander?

610
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,281
He's not here today.

611
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:15,760
Okay.

612
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:17,840
Well, just we could look at it later.

613
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:20,561
But it's on 145.

614
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:24,321
It's the end of a long paragraph.

615
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:28,320
Sort of the middle, sort of the bottom-ish part of 145.

616
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,880
The very last sentence of the paragraph.

617
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,001
I bet it's correctly translated.

618
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:39,840
As projecting, understanding is the kind of being of Dasein in which it is its possibilities as possible.

619
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:42,161
I like David, Dave's version.

620
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:48,961
Heidegger's telling me what it is from his perspective, not what it is from the acting perspective.

621
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,600
Same, I thought it would be.

622
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,240
So anyway, we got a way out, so let's take it.

623
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:00,001
So we're doing the four watt pronoun.

624
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:07,521
I'm still looking for the sentence I was looking for where it says projecting has nothing to do with comporting yourself towards a plan that has been thought out.

625
00:59:07,521 --> 00:59:09,120
That's somewhere on this page.

626
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,721
So it says on my notes.

627
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,840
I don't see it in there.

628
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:13,681
Do you see it anywhere?

629
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,521
Well, that's all right, except that I better correct it so that I.

630
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:23,520
No, I don't have my pen.

631
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:24,640
It's there?

632
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,280
Where?

633
00:59:25,921 --> 00:59:27,520
Four sentences down.

634
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,401
Okay, let's see.

635
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,080
I still don't see it.

636
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,561
Four sentences down on 185.

637
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,760
Ah, well, where Spielram is in the brackets.

638
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,561
Okay, let's see.

639
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:42,760
Being and as thrown.

640
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,720
Let's go back there.

641
00:59:38,401 --> 00:59:45,320
Gets its spiel round.

642
00:59:38,401 --> 00:59:45,481
Okay.

643
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,481
And as thrown, Dasein is thrown into the kind of being which we call projecting.

644
00:59:49,481 --> 00:59:49,880
Ah, good.

645
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,640
Yeah, there's a crucial sentence.

646
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:56,040
Projecting has nothing to do with comporting oneself sort of plan that's been thought out.

647
00:59:56,041 --> 01:00:01,320
I mean, those of you who had Searle know that when you're trying to do something, it's like having a plan.

648
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:03,801
I mean, it's a little more basic, but it's the same idea.

649
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:10,361
It is not some, you set yourself some kind of goal and you're acting to achieve it.

650
01:00:10,921 --> 01:00:16,521
And Dasein has, as Dasein already projected itself as long as it's projecting.

651
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:22,200
Yeah, it's always already being drawn into things.

652
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,961
That's what that's saying again.

653
01:00:23,961 --> 01:00:26,041
Okay, so now I can go on.

654
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:33,080
Oh, I wanted to read you a quote, which I'm going to give out next time when I get all this together.

655
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,720
But I don't like projecting, as I've said again and again.

656
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:46,600
It sounds too much like you are doing it, and I want it to be responding to, being drawn by, an affordance.

657
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,161
I think Heidegger just hasn't quite got the right words for it.

658
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:57,800
I think that he's being amazing to get this close to this bottom level when no philosopher ever has before.

659
01:00:59,561 --> 01:01:06,521
And a student of Gervich, a student of Heidegger named Aaron Gervich, gets it much righter.

660
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:13,880
Gerich is sort of my teacher, and I guess that's how I guess I should give him credit for tuning me into this.

661
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,000
I'm just going to read.

662
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:22,680
This is his idea of how what happens in acting, like going out a door or if you're making a tennis stroke or anything you want.

663
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:29,920
What is imposed on us to do is not determined by us as someone standing outside the situation, simply looking on at it.

664
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:40,241
What occurs and is imposed are rather prescribed by the situation, and we do more and greater justice to it the more we let ourselves be guided by it.

665
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:43,441
That's the let yourself be drawn in.

666
01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:49,680
The less reserved we are in immersing ourselves in it and subordinating ourselves to it.

667
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:54,880
That is, the better you're better at it and everything is going right, the more you're absorbed in it.

668
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,200
That's his immersing ourselves in it.

669
01:01:57,201 --> 01:02:04,720
We find ourselves in a situation and are interwoven with it, encompassed by it, indeed, just absorbed into it.

670
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,880
That's just everything is right there.

671
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:15,040
That says there's no you, that you're absorbed into it, that the more you're absorbed into it, the better things are going.

672
01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:27,920
It's not, he's not trying to describe how it looks from outside by looking at it, but you do greater justice to the situation the more you let yourself be absorbed in it to the point where you disappear.

673
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Gerbich has got it exactly right.

674
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,441
So, I'm going to, that's such a nice quote.

675
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:38,401
I'm going to give it, so put it on the website, give it to everybody so they can read it over and over if you get, if you feel lost.

676
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:53,200
And that's just the same as that specific kind of forgetting in which you have to have if you're going to go to work and really get something done.

677
01:02:53,201 --> 01:02:57,840
A lot of this, I said already, so I have to go over it to see what I haven't said already.

678
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:13,000
Well, now I'm ready to read 188.

679
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:24,441
I mean, we've got enough phenomena on the plate so that we can understand, I mean, enough, yeah, enough phenomena that we can understand as sort of abstract things.

680
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:26,920
So, 188, where is it?

681
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,800
The projecting of the understanding has its own possibility.

682
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,000
Where is it?

683
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:35,080
Okay, yes, but I did read it already.

684
01:03:35,481 --> 01:03:38,680
It's the third line of that section.

685
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,441
The projecting of the understanding has its own possibility of developing itself.

686
01:03:42,441 --> 01:03:45,160
This development of the understanding we call interpretation.

687
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:50,521
In it, the understanding appropriates understandingly that which is understood by it.

688
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:56,361
And all this stuff, which seems just incomprehensible, I hope it begins to seem comprehensible.

689
01:03:56,361 --> 01:04:01,800
In interpretation, understanding does not become something different, it becomes itself.

690
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:13,561
That sounds like this implicit story that it's been an as thing all along, but then he says such interpretation is grounded existentially in understanding, the latter does not arise from the former.

691
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:21,880
And then you get the sense: well, whatever understanding is, it's more basic than interpretation, and it makes interpretation possible.

692
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:27,320
And without it, you couldn't have interpretation, though, without interpretation, you can have understanding.

693
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,000
That's the grounding relation.

694
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,481
That's the same thing that I read in the time lectures.

695
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:34,441
Okay.

696
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:50,521
Okay, now, no, yeah, now I was going to say more about this normative pull to where you, I'm not sure I want to say it.

697
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:51,401
Let me see that.

698
01:04:57,521 --> 01:05:04,720
Okay, here's another way of putting it, where he talks about the blackboard being in the wrong place in another lecture course.

699
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,360
But I'll talk about the bench being where you're sitting, suppose they were movable chairs.

700
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:14,960
Experiencing the ready-to-hand is an instance, I'm just reading my own stuff, of the normative pull.

701
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,280
The bench affords sitting.

702
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:22,561
So if the bench in the classroom is facing the wrong way, we'll have to turn it around.

703
01:05:22,561 --> 01:05:30,401
But remember, improving is no longer simply responding to the situation and doing what the ready-to-hand draws you to do.

704
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:34,561
Improving always gets you to the unready-to-hand.

705
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,080
The unready-to-hand always gets you the as structure.

706
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:44,240
So now we're experiencing the bench as for facing the lecture, and it's not.

707
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:45,760
So we're going to improve it.

708
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,680
If you move to improve, you have to focus on what counts as appropriate.

709
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,760
You thematize the what-for.

710
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:58,561
There's always, that's the basic, what the understanding, the basic understanding understands is the what for.

711
01:05:58,561 --> 01:06:00,960
What does that remind you of?

712
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,120
Well, it's the two go out.

713
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:05,600
You don't experience the door.

714
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,840
You experience the two go out.

715
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:13,040
That's how Heidegger expresses that by saying what you experience is the what for.

716
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:22,720
The as structure comes in as soon as you respond in terms of the function, instead of responding to the solicitation that it has by virtue of having that function.

717
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,080
I'm saying the same thing again and again.

718
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:27,360
The function of the door is for you to go out of the room.

719
01:06:27,361 --> 01:06:29,840
That's what it does as a door.

720
01:06:30,561 --> 01:06:34,880
And you don't respond to its function.

721
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,680
You respond to it drawing you to go out.

722
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,561
That's the solicitation.

723
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:46,441
There are things in the world to which you're responding, but it's misleading to suggest that you experience them as things to which you're responding.

724
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:54,521
That is, and here's a new slogan which I put in italics: one perceives only the invitation, not the source of the invitation.

725
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,441
That's just the same as, let me say it in terms of solicitation.

726
01:06:58,441 --> 01:07:04,200
You perceive the solicitation, that is, you're drawn out the door, not the window, when you want to leave.

727
01:07:04,201 --> 01:07:10,441
But you don't have to perceive the door, which is, so to speak, doing the soliciting for you to go out.

728
01:07:10,441 --> 01:07:18,360
That's just, again, to say at the understanding level, you just take up the affordance and do it.

729
01:07:18,361 --> 01:07:22,441
At the interpretation level, you can perceive the door as a door.

730
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:28,441
And if the door has anything wrong with it, like the bench is the wrong way, then you can perceive its function and you can fix it.

731
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:35,640
But when everything's going well, you don't perceive the source of the invitation or solicitation, you just do it.

732
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:43,960
That doesn't mean that to sit on the bench, we that doesn't deny that to sit on the bench, you have to see the bench.

733
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,040
That's what circumspection does.

734
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,000
That is, you have to take account of the bench.

735
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,600
And you have to have a familiarity with what benches do.

736
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:57,800
Then, if you're tired or if you're at a class, you just sit on it.

737
01:07:58,121 --> 01:08:00,680
You are drawn into the affordance.

738
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,281
You are, I forget what Gervich said, but I liked his way of saying it.

739
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,120
What did he say?

740
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:13,320
We are, we are guided by it.

741
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,080
That's just another attempt to say this.

742
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:18,120
Okay.

743
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,600
So when something goes wrong, then you see something as something.

744
01:08:23,241 --> 01:08:24,401
I said that.

745
01:08:28,241 --> 01:08:33,040
That's when the ready of the hand comes expressly into the sight that understands.

746
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,080
And I said that.

747
01:08:34,081 --> 01:08:38,401
Oh, but there's another way to say it, that there is a counter thrust.

748
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:42,561
Possibilities exert their counter thrust upon Dasein.

749
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,640
I don't remember where that is, though.

750
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,080
See, I didn't write down a page number.

751
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:47,680
Does that sound familiar to anybody?

752
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:55,920
If you come across it, counterthrust is just another name for resist your just being drawn into it.

753
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,600
Then the ready of the hand becomes expressly into the sight that understands.

754
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,800
I wonder if that's where counter thrust goes.

755
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,880
That's on 189.

756
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,321
188, we're on 188.

757
01:09:08,401 --> 01:09:10,321
Oh, boy, everything comes right there at the beginning.

758
01:09:10,321 --> 01:09:11,361
Where is it?

759
01:09:14,561 --> 01:09:16,561
188, the top of the page?

760
01:09:18,161 --> 01:09:19,680
What, German, where?

761
01:09:21,281 --> 01:09:22,481
Oh, the Ruchlog.

762
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,600
I see, yes.

763
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,080
Okay.

764
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,521
Yes, they exert, well, let's read it.

765
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,600
It says, as understanding Dasein projects, it's being upon possibilities.

766
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,240
Okay.

767
01:09:32,561 --> 01:09:48,080
This being toward possibilities, that's the to go out, which understands is itself an ability to be, and it is so because of the way these possibilities, as disclosed, exert their counter thrust upon Dasein.

768
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,401
I've got it wrong.

769
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,080
The counter thrust isn't breakdown, as I just said it is.

770
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:58,320
The counter thrust is another way of saying it's drawing you in.

771
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:01,120
You're going by the door, and the door draws you in.

772
01:10:01,121 --> 01:10:03,521
I'm pretty sure that's what it's about.

773
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,521
I wish I had a pen so I could fix what I'm doing.

774
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:10,760
Can I borrow a pen from you?

775
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:12,040
Okay.

776
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,240
Okay.

777
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,840
Let's just.

778
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,401
No.

779
01:10:17,401 --> 01:10:18,040
Okay.

780
01:10:18,521 --> 01:10:26,920
Then our response is either to stay fully involved and fix the problem or pay attention to our activity.

781
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:33,000
That which is disclosed in understanding.

782
01:10:33,321 --> 01:10:34,281
Now, where's the next?

783
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:38,441
On 189, I just suddenly all the page numbers have disappeared from here.

784
01:10:38,441 --> 01:10:43,960
That which is disclosed in understanding, that which is understood, help me find that one.

785
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:46,200
I got it.

786
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:48,441
A little below the middle, in the middle of the line.

787
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:56,840
That which is disclosed in understanding, that which is understood, is already accessible in such a way that it's as which can be made to stand out explicitly.

788
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,321
The as makes up the structure of the explicitness.

789
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:02,200
We've already said that, so I don't need that anymore.

790
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,600
I think I'm going to make it to the end.

791
01:11:13,081 --> 01:11:21,800
On 190, I like when something, when all my stuff is gone, oh, here.

792
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:24,840
I'm going to read it.

793
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,561
Somebody will find it.

794
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:37,000
When something within the world is encountered as such, the thing in question already has an involvement which is disclosed in our understanding of the world, and this involvement is one that gets laid out in interpretation.

795
01:11:37,401 --> 01:11:40,840
Again, I don't know where it is, but it doesn't matter.

796
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,760
We've said it a million times.

797
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:56,320
Okay, now I'm going to read, stop with 199, the first full paragraph.

798
01:11:53,401 --> 01:12:00,000
The ready-to-hand is always understood in terms of a totality of involvements.

799
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:01,040
We talked about that.

800
01:12:01,281 --> 01:12:03,920
This totality need not be grasped explicitly.

801
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,920
That proves that you can have understanding without interpretation.

802
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:12,240
without being grasped explicitly by a thematic interpretation.

803
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:24,160
Even if it has undergone such an interpretation, so I notice the door, for instance, it recedes into an understanding which does not stand out from the background.

804
01:12:24,161 --> 01:12:34,401
So it always goes back into the background, where it governs what you're doing, and you take account of it circumspectively, but you don't, it isn't explicit at all.

805
01:12:34,401 --> 01:12:41,120
And this is the very mode in which it is the essential foundation for everyday circumspective interpretation.

806
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,361
I sort of rest my case with that.

807
01:12:43,361 --> 01:12:47,280
I mean, so there is something more fundamental than interpretation.

808
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:54,800
And even when there's interpretation, as soon as you get used to coping with whatever you're coping with, then it goes back into the background.

809
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,481
And when it's in the background and you're not noticing it, you're not seeing it, then it counts as understanding.

810
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:07,280
And that understanding is always there and is the foundation for interpretation, whenever you get it.

811
01:13:07,281 --> 01:13:12,800
Now, I have the feeling I was sort of preaching more to myself than to you all.

812
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:36,240
But now, when you go back and read this, if you do, the next thing is to see, and we're going to start with that next time, the way you get from this level to the next stages up to logic and the predicate calculus, all of which is going on on the next bunch of pages, up the page.

813
01:13:36,561 --> 01:13:42,920
Well, I don't know quite where I'm going to stop, but I hope to get up to 203 next time.

814
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:44,840
But, okay.

815
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,720
Thanks.
